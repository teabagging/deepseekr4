[Insert diagram similar to original, with mentioned angles.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it. There are two parallel lines, m and n, and a transversal cuts through both of them. At the intersection with line m, the smallest angle created by the transversal is 40 degrees. On the same side, the angle between the transversal and line n is 70 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle y, which is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side.Hmm, let me break this down. First, since lines m and n are parallel, and a transversal cuts through them, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals to find the missing angles.The smallest angle at line m is 40 degrees. Since the transversal creates three angles at each intersection, these angles should add up to 180 degrees because they form a straight line. So, if the smallest angle is 40 degrees, the other two angles at that intersection must be larger.Wait, actually, when a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. So, the angle corresponding to 40 degrees on line n should also be 40 degrees. But the problem says that on the same side, the angle between the transversal and line n is 70 degrees. That must mean that this 70-degree angle is not the corresponding angle but maybe an alternate interior or exterior angle.Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Imagine two horizontal parallel lines, m and n, and a transversal cutting through them from the top left to the bottom right. At the intersection with line m, the smallest angle is 40 degrees. So, that would be the angle between the transversal and line m on one side. On the same side, at line n, the angle is 70 degrees.Since lines m and n are parallel, the angles formed by the transversal should have some relationships. The 40-degree angle on line m and the 70-degree angle on line n are on the same side of the transversal. That makes them consecutive interior angles, right? Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.Wait, but 40 degrees and 70 degrees add up to 110 degrees, not 180. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I got the wrong pair of angles. Let me think again.If the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, then the angle on the other side of the transversal at line m should be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees because they are supplementary. Now, the angle on line n on the same side as the 40-degree angle is 70 degrees. So, maybe these two angles, 40 degrees and 70 degrees, are not consecutive interior angles but something else.Alternatively, perhaps the 70-degree angle is the corresponding angle to another angle on line m. Since corresponding angles are equal, if the 70-degree angle is corresponding, then there should be a 70-degree angle on line m as well. But the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, so that can't be.Wait, maybe the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle. Alternate interior angles are equal when lines are parallel. So, if the angle on line n is 70 degrees, then the alternate interior angle on line m should also be 70 degrees. But the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, so the other angles must be 70 degrees and 140 degrees.Let me check. At line m, the angles created by the transversal are 40 degrees, 70 degrees, and 140 degrees. Wait, that doesn't add up because 40 + 70 + 140 = 250, which is more than 180. That can't be right because the angles on a straight line should add up to 180 degrees.I think I'm mixing up something here. Let me clarify. At each intersection, the transversal creates two angles with each line, but since it's a straight line, the sum of the angles on one side should be 180 degrees. So, if the smallest angle is 40 degrees, the adjacent angle should be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. Then, the other two angles on the opposite side should be equal to these because of the parallel lines.Wait, so on line m, we have angles of 40 degrees and 140 degrees. On line n, the corresponding angles should also be 40 degrees and 140 degrees. But the problem says that on the same side, the angle between the transversal and line n is 70 degrees. That doesn't match.Maybe the 70-degree angle is not a corresponding angle but an alternate exterior or interior angle. Let me think. If the transversal intersects line m and n, creating angles, and on the same side, the angle on line n is 70 degrees, perhaps this is an alternate interior angle to another angle on line m.But alternate interior angles are equal, so if the angle on line n is 70 degrees, the alternate interior angle on line m should also be 70 degrees. But the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, so 70 degrees must be another angle on line m. Therefore, the angles on line m are 40 degrees, 70 degrees, and 140 degrees? Wait, that still adds up to 250 degrees, which is impossible.I must be making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Since lines m and n are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. The smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, so the corresponding angle on line n should also be 40 degrees. But the problem states that the angle on line n on the same side is 70 degrees. That suggests that 70 degrees is not the corresponding angle but perhaps an adjacent angle.Wait, maybe the 70-degree angle is the exterior angle on line n, and the corresponding interior angle is 40 degrees. So, the exterior angle is 70 degrees, and the interior angle would be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. But that doesn't seem to fit with the 40 degrees.Alternatively, perhaps the 70-degree angle is the same-side interior angle with the 40-degree angle on line m. Since same-side interior angles are supplementary, 40 + 70 = 110, which is not 180. That can't be.Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the properties. Let me recall: corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and same-side interior angles are supplementary.So, if the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, the corresponding angle on line n should be 40 degrees. But the problem says that on the same side, the angle between the transversal and line n is 70 degrees. That must mean that the 70-degree angle is not the corresponding angle but perhaps the alternate interior angle.If the 70-degree angle is the alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m should be 70 degrees. But the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, so 70 degrees must be another angle on line m. Therefore, the angles on line m would be 40 degrees and 70 degrees, but that leaves the third angle as 180 - (40 + 70) = 70 degrees. Wait, that would mean two angles of 70 degrees and one of 40 degrees on line m, which adds up to 180 degrees.But then, the corresponding angle on line n for the 70-degree angle on line m would also be 70 degrees. But the problem states that on the same side, the angle on line n is 70 degrees. So, that seems consistent.But then, what is angle y? It says angle y is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side. So, the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side would be the angle adjacent to the 40-degree angle, which is 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. Therefore, the supplement of 140 degrees would be 180 - 140 = 40 degrees. But that doesn't seem right because the problem says angle y is the supplement of that angle.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. The angle between the transversal and line m on the other side is 140 degrees, so the supplement of that would be 180 - 140 = 40 degrees. But that would mean angle y is 40 degrees, but the problem states that the angle on line n on the same side is 70 degrees, which is different.Alternatively, perhaps angle y is the angle on line m on the other side, which is 140 degrees, and its supplement is 40 degrees. But that doesn't seem to fit the problem statement.Wait, let me read the problem again carefully: \\"angle y which is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side.\\" So, the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side is 140 degrees, and its supplement is 180 - 140 = 40 degrees. So, angle y would be 40 degrees. But that seems too small, and the problem mentions that the angle on line n is 70 degrees, which is larger.I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it step by step.1. Lines m and n are parallel.2. A transversal intersects both lines, creating angles.3. At line m, the smallest angle is 40 degrees.4. On the same side, at line n, the angle is 70 degrees.5. We need to find angle y, which is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side.First, since lines m and n are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. So, the angle corresponding to 40 degrees on line m should be 40 degrees on line n. However, the problem states that on the same side, the angle on line n is 70 degrees. This suggests that the 70-degree angle is not the corresponding angle but perhaps an alternate interior or exterior angle.If the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m would also be 70 degrees. But since the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, the other angles must be 70 degrees and 140 degrees (since 40 + 70 + 140 = 250, which is incorrect because the sum should be 180). Wait, that can't be right.Wait, no, at each intersection, the transversal creates two angles with each line, and those two angles are supplementary. So, at line m, the angles are 40 degrees and 140 degrees. Similarly, at line n, the angles are 70 degrees and 110 degrees (since 70 + 110 = 180). But since lines m and n are parallel, the corresponding angles should be equal. So, if line m has a 40-degree angle, line n should also have a 40-degree angle corresponding to it. But the problem says that on the same side, the angle on line n is 70 degrees. That means that the 70-degree angle is not the corresponding angle but perhaps an alternate interior or exterior angle.If the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m would be 70 degrees. But since the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, the other angle must be 140 degrees. Therefore, the angles on line m are 40 and 140 degrees, and on line n, they are 70 and 110 degrees.But wait, if the corresponding angle to 40 degrees on line m is 40 degrees on line n, but the problem says it's 70 degrees on line n, that contradicts. So, perhaps the 70-degree angle is the same-side interior angle with the 40-degree angle on line m. Since same-side interior angles are supplementary, 40 + 70 = 110, which is not 180. That can't be.I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to draw it out mentally again.Imagine line m with a transversal intersecting it, creating a 40-degree angle. Since the transversal crosses line m, the opposite angle is also 40 degrees, and the adjacent angles are 140 degrees each. Now, on line n, which is parallel to m, the transversal creates angles. On the same side as the 40-degree angle on line m, the angle on line n is 70 degrees. So, this 70-degree angle is on the same side as the 40-degree angle on line m.Since lines m and n are parallel, the angle on line n should correspond to the angle on line m. But 70 degrees is not equal to 40 degrees, so perhaps it's an alternate interior angle. If the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m would be 70 degrees. But line m already has a 40-degree angle, so the other angle must be 140 degrees. Therefore, the angles on line m are 40 and 140 degrees, and on line n, they are 70 and 110 degrees.But then, how does this relate to angle y? Angle y is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side. The angle between the transversal and line m on the other side is 140 degrees, so its supplement is 180 - 140 = 40 degrees. Therefore, angle y is 40 degrees.But wait, the problem mentions that the angle on line n on the same side is 70 degrees, which is larger than 40 degrees. If angle y is 40 degrees, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm misinterpreting which angle is which.Alternatively, perhaps angle y is the angle on line n, which is 70 degrees, and its supplement is 110 degrees. But the problem says angle y is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side, not line n.Wait, let's clarify. The angle between the transversal and line m on the other side is 140 degrees, so its supplement is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle y is 40 degrees. But that seems too small, and the problem mentions a 70-degree angle on line n, which is larger.I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the transversal creating angles at both lines m and n. At line m, the smallest angle is 40 degrees, so the adjacent angle is 140 degrees. At line n, on the same side, the angle is 70 degrees. Since lines m and n are parallel, the angle on line n that is corresponding to the 40-degree angle on line m should also be 40 degrees. But the problem states that this angle is 70 degrees, which is a contradiction unless the 70-degree angle is not the corresponding angle.Therefore, the 70-degree angle must be an alternate interior or exterior angle. If it's an alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m is 70 degrees, but line m already has a 40-degree angle, so the other angle is 140 degrees. Therefore, the angles on line m are 40 and 140 degrees, and on line n, they are 70 and 110 degrees.Now, angle y is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side. The angle on the other side of line m is 140 degrees, so its supplement is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle y is 40 degrees.But wait, the problem mentions that the angle on line n on the same side is 70 degrees, which is larger than 40 degrees. If angle y is 40 degrees, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm misinterpreting which angle is which.Alternatively, perhaps angle y is the angle on line n, which is 70 degrees, and its supplement is 110 degrees.

But the problem specifies that y is the supplement of the angle on line m, not line n.Wait, I think I'm confusing the sides. Let me try to visualize it again. The transversal intersects line m, creating a 40-degree angle on one side and a 140-degree angle on the other. On line n, on the same side as the 40-degree angle on line m, the angle is 70 degrees. Since lines m and n are parallel, the angle on line n corresponding to the 40-degree angle on line m should be 40 degrees. But it's given as 70 degrees, so perhaps the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle.If the 70-degree angle is an alternate interior angle, then the corresponding angle on line m is 70 degrees. But line m already has a 40-degree angle, so the other angle must be 140 degrees.

Let me try to visualize it again.Imagine line m with a transversal intersecting it, creating a 40-degree angle on the top left. The adjacent angle on line m would be 140 degrees. On line n, which is parallel to m, the transversal intersects it, creating a 70-degree angle on the same side (top left). Since lines m and n are parallel, the angle on line n corresponding to the 40-degree angle on line m should be 40 degrees, but it's given as 70 degrees.

Maybe the diagram is such that angle y is indeed 40 degrees.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the corresponding angles. Let me try one more time.If the smallest angle on line m is 40 degrees, then the corresponding angle on line n is also 40 degrees. However, the problem states that on the same side, the angle on line n is 70 degrees. Therefore, the 70-degree angle must be an alternate interior angle, making the corresponding angle on line m 70 degrees. But line m already has a 40-degree angle, so the other angle is 140 degrees. Therefore, the angles on line m are 40 and 140 degrees, and on line n, they are 70 and 110 degrees.Now, angle y is the supplement of the angle between the transversal and line m on the other side. The angle on the other side of line m is 140 degrees, so its supplement is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle y is 40 degrees.But the problem mentions that the angle on line n on the same side is 70 degrees, which is larger than 40 degrees. If angle y is 40 degrees, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the diagram.Wait, perhaps angle y is the angle on line n, which is 70 degrees, and its supplement is 110 degrees. But the problem says angle y is the supplement of the angle on line m, not line n.I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the properties of parallel lines and transversals, angle y should be 40 degrees."},{"question":"Given that f(x) is a differentiable function defined on (-infty, 1) cup (1, +infty), and f(x) = f'(2)x^2 + xf(x) + x, find the expression for f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the expression for a function f(x). The function is defined on two intervals: from negative infinity to 1 and from 1 to positive infinity. It's differentiable, which means it has a derivative everywhere it's defined, except maybe at x=1 where it's not included. The equation given is f(x) = f'(2)x¬≤ + x f(x) + x. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to parse it. So, f(x) is equal to f'(2) times x squared plus x times f(x) plus x. First, I notice that f'(2) is the derivative of f at x=2. Since f is differentiable on the intervals (-‚àû,1) and (1, ‚àû), x=2 is in the second interval, so f'(2) exists. Maybe I can plug in x=2 into the equation to get an equation involving f(2) and f'(2). Let me try that. So, if I set x=2, the equation becomes:f(2) = f'(2)*(2)¬≤ + 2*f(2) + 2Simplify that:f(2) = 4f'(2) + 2f(2) + 2Let me rearrange this equation to collect like terms. Subtract 2f(2) from both sides:f(2) - 2f(2) = 4f'(2) + 2Which simplifies to:-f(2) = 4f'(2) + 2Or:4f'(2) + f(2) + 2 = 0Okay, so that's one equation involving f'(2) and f(2). Now, I need another equation to solve for these two variables. Since the original equation involves f(x) and f'(x), maybe differentiating both sides will give me another equation.Let me differentiate both sides of the original equation f(x) = f'(2)x¬≤ + x f(x) + x with respect to x.The left side is straightforward: d/dx [f(x)] = f'(x).The right side: d/dx [f'(2)x¬≤ + x f(x) + x]. Let's differentiate term by term.First term: f'(2)x¬≤. The derivative is 2f'(2)x.Second term: x f(x). Using the product rule, the derivative is f(x) + x f'(x).Third term: x. The derivative is 1.So putting it all together, the derivative of the right side is:2f'(2)x + f(x) + x f'(x) + 1Therefore, after differentiation, we have:f'(x) = 2f'(2)x + f(x) + x f'(x) + 1Hmm, that's an equation involving f'(x) and f(x). Let me try to rearrange it to solve for f'(x). Bring all terms involving f'(x) to one side:f'(x) - x f'(x) = 2f'(2)x + f(x) + 1Factor out f'(x) on the left:f'(x)(1 - x) = 2f'(2)x + f(x) + 1Now, solve for f'(x):f'(x) = [2f'(2)x + f(x) + 1] / (1 - x)Hmm, that's an expression for f'(x). Maybe I can use this at x=2 to get another equation.Let me plug in x=2 into this equation. So, f'(2) = [2f'(2)*2 + f(2) + 1] / (1 - 2)Simplify the denominator: 1 - 2 = -1So, f'(2) = [4f'(2) + f(2) + 1] / (-1)Multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the denominator:-f'(2) = 4f'(2) + f(2) + 1Bring all terms to one side:-f'(2) - 4f'(2) - f(2) - 1 = 0Which simplifies to:-5f'(2) - f(2) - 1 = 0Or:5f'(2) + f(2) + 1 = 0Now, I have two equations:1. 4f'(2) + f(2) + 2 = 02. 5f'(2) + f(2) + 1 = 0Let me write them down:Equation 1: 4a + b + 2 = 0, where a = f'(2) and b = f(2)Equation 2: 5a + b + 1 = 0Now, I can solve this system of equations for a and b.Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:(5a + b + 1) - (4a + b + 2) = 0 - 0Simplify:5a + b + 1 - 4a - b - 2 = 0Which becomes:a - 1 = 0So, a = 1Therefore, f'(2) = 1.Now, plug a = 1 into Equation 1:4(1) + b + 2 = 04 + b + 2 = 06 + b = 0So, b = -6Therefore, f(2) = -6.Now, going back to the original equation:f(x) = f'(2)x¬≤ + x f(x) + xWe know f'(2) = 1, so substitute that in:f(x) = (1)x¬≤ + x f(x) + xSimplify:f(x) = x¬≤ + x f(x) + xLet me rearrange this equation to solve for f(x). Bring the x f(x) term to the left side:f(x) - x f(x) = x¬≤ + xFactor out f(x) on the left:f(x)(1 - x) = x¬≤ + xNow, solve for f(x):f(x) = (x¬≤ + x) / (1 - x)Simplify the numerator:x¬≤ + x = x(x + 1)So, f(x) = [x(x + 1)] / (1 - x)Alternatively, I can factor out a negative sign from the denominator:f(x) = [x(x + 1)] / -(x - 1) = - [x(x + 1)] / (x - 1)But both forms are correct. The original problem didn't specify any particular form, so either is acceptable, but perhaps the first form is simpler.Let me just verify this solution to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, compute f'(x). f(x) = (x¬≤ + x)/(1 - x). Let's differentiate this using the quotient rule.Let me denote numerator u = x¬≤ + x, denominator v = 1 - x.Then, f'(x) = (u'v - uv') / v¬≤Compute u' = 2x + 1, v' = -1So, f'(x) = [(2x + 1)(1 - x) - (x¬≤ + x)(-1)] / (1 - x)¬≤Simplify numerator:First term: (2x + 1)(1 - x) = 2x(1 - x) + 1(1 - x) = 2x - 2x¬≤ + 1 - x = (2x - x) + (-2x¬≤) + 1 = x - 2x¬≤ + 1Second term: -(x¬≤ + x)(-1) = (x¬≤ + x)So, numerator becomes:(x - 2x¬≤ + 1) + (x¬≤ + x) = x - 2x¬≤ + 1 + x¬≤ + x = (x + x) + (-2x¬≤ + x¬≤) + 1 = 2x - x¬≤ + 1So, f'(x) = ( -x¬≤ + 2x + 1 ) / (1 - x)¬≤Now, let's compute f'(2):f'(2) = ( - (2)¬≤ + 2*(2) + 1 ) / (1 - 2)¬≤ = (-4 + 4 + 1) / (1) = (1)/1 = 1Which matches our earlier result that f'(2) = 1.Also, compute f(2):f(2) = (2¬≤ + 2) / (1 - 2) = (4 + 2)/(-1) = 6 / (-1) = -6Which also matches our earlier result.So, plugging back into the original equation:f(x) = f'(2)x¬≤ + x f(x) + xLeft side: f(x) = (x¬≤ + x)/(1 - x)Right side: 1*x¬≤ + x*(x¬≤ + x)/(1 - x) + x = x¬≤ + [x(x¬≤ + x)]/(1 - x) + xLet me compute the right side:First term: x¬≤Second term: [x¬≥ + x¬≤]/(1 - x)Third term: xCombine all terms:x¬≤ + x + [x¬≥ + x¬≤]/(1 - x)Let me write x¬≤ + x as (x¬≤ + x)(1 - x)/(1 - x) to have a common denominator:(x¬≤ + x)(1 - x) + x¬≥ + x¬≤ all over (1 - x)Compute numerator:(x¬≤ + x)(1 - x) = x¬≤(1 - x) + x(1 - x) = x¬≤ - x¬≥ + x - x¬≤ = (-x¬≥) + (x¬≤ - x¬≤) + x = -x¬≥ + xSo, numerator becomes:(-x¬≥ + x) + x¬≥ + x¬≤ = (-x¬≥ + x¬≥) + x¬≤ + x = 0 + x¬≤ + x = x¬≤ + xTherefore, right side is (x¬≤ + x)/(1 - x), which equals f(x). So, the equation holds.Therefore, the solution f(x) = (x¬≤ + x)/(1 - x) is correct.I think that's all.

How many different ways can you pick two consecutive cards where both cards are not only from the same suit but also one is a face card (Jack, Queen, King) and the other is a number card (Ace through 10)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a deck of cards. It says there are 48 cards, equally divided among 4 suits, which means each suit has 12 cards. The question is asking how many different ways I can pick two consecutive cards where both are from the same suit, and one is a face card (Jack, Queen, King) and the other is a number card (Ace through 10). Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what's being asked. I have to pick two cards in a row, and both need to be from the same suit. Additionally, one of them has to be a face card, and the other has to be a number card. So, it's not just any two cards from the same suit; they have to be one face and one number card.Let me think about the structure of the deck. There are 4 suits, each with 12 cards. In each suit, there are face cards: Jack, Queen, King. That's 3 face cards per suit. Then, the number cards are Ace through 10. Wait, is Ace considered a number card here? The problem says Ace through 10, so yes, Ace is included as a number card. So, that's 10 number cards per suit.So, in each suit, we have 3 face cards and 10 number cards. Now, I need to pick two consecutive cards from the same suit, one face and one number. I think the key here is to figure out how many such pairs exist in one suit and then multiply by the number of suits since the problem doesn't specify a particular suit.Let me focus on one suit first. In one suit, there are 3 face cards and 10 number cards. I need to pick two consecutive cards where one is a face and the other is a number. Wait, does \\"consecutive\\" mean in terms of their positions in the deck or in terms of their ranks? Hmm, the problem says \\"two consecutive cards,\\" so I think it refers to their positions in the deck. So, it's about picking two cards that are next to each other in the deck, both from the same suit, with one being a face card and the other a number card.But wait, the deck is shuffled, right? Or is it ordered? The problem doesn't specify, so I might need to assume that the deck is shuffled, meaning that the order of the cards is random. But then, how does that affect the number of ways to pick two consecutive cards?Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe \\"consecutive\\" just means two cards picked one after the other, regardless of their positions in the deck. So, it's about the sequence of picking two cards where the first is a face card and the second is a number card, or vice versa, both from the same suit.Okay, that makes more sense. So, it's about the order of picking, not their positions in the deck. So, for each suit, I can have two scenarios: face card first, then number card, or number card first, then face card.Let me calculate the number of ways for one suit first. In one suit, there are 3 face cards and 10 number cards. If I pick a face card first, there are 3 choices, and then a number card, which has 10 choices. So, that's 3 times 10, which is 30 ways.Similarly, if I pick a number card first, there are 10 choices, and then a face card, which has 3 choices. So, that's another 10 times 3, which is another 30 ways.So, for one suit, the total number of ways is 30 plus 30, which is 60.Now, since there are 4 suits, each with the same number of face and number cards, I can multiply the number of ways for one suit by 4. So, 60 times 4 is 240.Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. For each suit, we have 3 face and 10 number cards. The number of ordered pairs where one is face and the other is number is 3*10 + 10*3 = 60. Since there are 4 suits, it's 60*4 = 240.Yes, that seems correct. So, the total number of ways is 240.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations instead of permutations? Wait, no, because the order matters here since we're picking two consecutive cards, so it's about sequences, not combinations.Alternatively, I could think of it as the number of possible sequences where the first card is a face and the second is a number, plus the number of sequences where the first is a number and the second is a face, all within the same suit.So, for each suit, it's 3*10 + 10*3 = 60, as before. Multiply by 4 suits, and we get 240.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the answer should be 240."},{"question":"Andrew has a fair six-sided die labeled with 1 through 6. He tosses it repeatedly, and on every third roll writes down the number facing up, as long as it is not a 6. He stops as soon as the last two numbers he has written down are either both squares or one is a prime and the other is a square. What is the probability that he stops after writing squares consecutively?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Andrew rolling a die and writing down numbers every third roll, but only if it's not a 6. He stops when the last two numbers he wrote are either both squares or one is a prime and the other is a square. I need to find the probability that he stops because he wrote two squares in a row.First, I need to understand the setup clearly. Andrew is rolling a fair six-sided die repeatedly. Every third roll, he writes down the number if it's not a 6. So, effectively, he's only considering the numbers 1 through 5, and he writes them down every third roll. He keeps doing this until the last two numbers he wrote down meet one of two conditions: either both are squares, or one is a prime and the other is a square. I need to find the probability that when he stops, it's because he wrote two squares consecutively.Let me break this down step by step.1. **Identify the Numbers and Their Categories:**   The die has numbers 1 through 6. Since he only writes down numbers that are not 6, the relevant numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Now, I need to classify these numbers into squares and primes.   - **Squares:** The squares between 1 and 5 are 1 (1¬≤) and 4 (2¬≤). So, squares are {1, 4}.   - **Primes:** The prime numbers between 1 and 5 are 2, 3, and 5. So, primes are {2, 3, 5}.   Therefore, the numbers can be categorized as:   - Squares: 1, 4   - Primes: 2, 3, 52. **Understanding the Stopping Conditions:**   Andrew stops when the last two numbers he wrote down meet one of the following:   - Both are squares.   - One is a prime and the other is a square.   So, he stops when either:   - The last two numbers are both squares (e.g., 1 and 1, 1 and 4, 4 and 1, 4 and 4).   - The last two numbers consist of one prime and one square (e.g., 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 1 and 3, 3 and 1, etc.).   My goal is to find the probability that he stops specifically because he wrote two squares in a row.3. **Calculating Probabilities:**   Since Andrew writes down a number every third roll, each number he writes is independent of the previous ones, right? So, each write operation is an independent event with probabilities based on the die roll.   Let me calculate the probability of writing a square and the probability of writing a prime.   - **Probability of writing a square (P(S)):** There are 2 squares (1, 4) out of 5 possible numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). So, P(S) = 2/5.   - **Probability of writing a prime (P(P)):** There are 3 primes (2, 3, 5) out of 5 possible numbers. So, P(P) = 3/5.4. **Modeling the Process:**   Now, I need to model the process as a sequence of these independent events, where each event is writing a square or a prime. Andrew stops when either two squares are written consecutively or when a square and a prime are written consecutively (in any order).   This seems like a problem that can be modeled using Markov chains or state transitions. Let me think about the possible states.   - **State S:** The last number written was a square.   - **State P:** The last number written was a prime.   - **State Start:** The initial state before any numbers are written.   However, since Andrew is writing numbers every third roll, the process starts with the first write, so the initial state is effectively after the first number is written. But since the stopping condition depends on the last two numbers, I need to consider pairs.   Maybe it's better to model this as a sequence where each step depends on the previous one, and we're looking for the occurrence of either SS (two squares) or SP or PS (square followed by prime or prime followed by square).   But actually, the stopping condition is when either SS occurs or SP or PS occurs. So, the process stops at the first occurrence of SS, SP, or PS.   Wait, that's not quite right. The stopping condition is when the last two numbers are either both squares or one is a prime and the other is a square. So, it's when the last two numbers are SS, SP, or PS.   But in reality, SP and PS are different because the order matters. However, in terms of stopping, it doesn't matter which comes first; as long as the last two are one square and one prime, he stops.   So, the stopping conditions are:   - Last two numbers are SS, SP, or PS.   Therefore, the process continues until one of these pairs occurs.   So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the first occurrence of SS, SP, or PS is SS.   So, we need to find the probability that the first time either SS, SP, or PS occurs, it is SS.5. **Setting Up the Problem:**   Let me denote the following:   - Let‚Äôs define the states based on the last number written.   - State S: last number was a square.   - State P: last number was a prime.   - State Start: no numbers written yet.   However, since the process starts with the first write, the first state will be either S or P.   So, starting from the first write, which can be S with probability 2/5 or P with probability 3/5.   From there, depending on the next write, we can transition to another state or stop.   Let me model this as a Markov chain with states S, P, and an absorbing state when stopping.   Wait, but actually, the stopping occurs when two consecutive writes meet the condition. So, it's a bit different.   Maybe it's better to think in terms of the last two numbers. So, the state can be represented by the last number written. Then, depending on the next number, we can determine if we stop or not.   Let me try this approach.6. **Defining States:**   Let's define the states as follows:   - State Start: No numbers written yet.   - State S: Last number written was a square.   - State P: Last number written was a prime.   - State Stop: The process has stopped.   The transitions between states depend on the next number written.   From Start, the first number can be S or P:   - From Start, with probability 2/5, go to State S.   - From Start, with probability 3/5, go to State P.   From State S:   - If the next number is S, then we have SS, so we stop.   - If the next number is P, then we have SP, so we stop.   - So, from State S, regardless of the next number, we stop.   Wait, that can't be right. Because if from State S, the next number is S, we stop because of SS. If it's P, we stop because of SP. So, from State S, the process always stops on the next step.   Similarly, from State P:   - If the next number is S, we have PS, so we stop.   - If the next number is P, we have PP. But PP is not a stopping condition because the stopping condition is either SS, SP, or PS. So, PP does not cause a stop. Therefore, if from State P, the next number is P, we stay in State P.   Wait, so from State P:   - Next number S: stop (PS)   - Next number P: stay in P   So, from State S, the process always stops on the next step, either with SS or SP.   From State P, the process stops with probability 2/5 (if next is S) and continues with probability 3/5 (if next is P).   Therefore, the only way the process can continue is if we are in State P and the next number is P.   So, starting from Start, we go to either S or P.   If we go to S, then the next step will stop, either with SS or SP.   If we go to P, then with probability 2/5, we stop with PS, and with probability 3/5, we stay in P.   So, the process can potentially stay in P for multiple steps, each time with probability 3/5, until eventually, with probability 2/5, it stops.   Therefore, the probability that the process stops with SS is the probability that the first transition after Start is to S, and then the next transition is to S again.   Wait, no. Because from Start, if we go to S, then the next transition must be either S or P, but regardless, we stop. So, the probability of stopping with SS is the probability that from Start, we go to S, and then from S, we go to S.   Similarly, the probability of stopping with SP is the probability that from Start, we go to S, and then from S, we go to P.   Similarly, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that from Start, we go to P, and then from P, we go to S.   However, the process can also stay in P for multiple steps before stopping.   So, the total probability of stopping with SS is the probability that the first two writes are SS.   The total probability of stopping with SP is the probability that the first two writes are SP.   The total probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first time we have a square after some number of primes is when we stop.   Wait, maybe it's better to model this as an infinite series.   Let me think.   The probability that the process stops with SS is the probability that the first two writes are SS.   The probability that the process stops with SP is the probability that the first two writes are SP.   The probability that the process stops with PS is the probability that the first write is P, then after some number of additional P's, we get an S.   So, let's calculate these probabilities.7. **Calculating the Probability of Stopping with SS:**   The probability that the first two writes are SS.   The first write is S with probability 2/5.   The second write is S with probability 2/5.   So, the probability is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.8. **Calculating the Probability of Stopping with SP:**   The probability that the first two writes are SP.   The first write is S with probability 2/5.   The second write is P with probability 3/5.   So, the probability is (2/5) * (3/5) = 6/25.9. **Calculating the Probability of Stopping with PS:**   This is a bit more involved because the process can stay in P for multiple steps before transitioning to S.   Let me denote the probability of stopping with PS as P_PS.   To calculate P_PS, we can think of it as the probability that the first write is P, and then eventually, after some number of P's, we write an S.   Let's model this as follows:   - The first write is P with probability 3/5.   - Then, from State P, each time we write another P with probability 3/5, and we stay in P.   - Eventually, we write an S with probability 2/5, which stops the process with PS.   So, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first write is P, and then at some point, we write an S.   This is equivalent to the probability that the first write is P, and then in the subsequent writes, we eventually write an S before writing another S or P in a way that stops the process.   Wait, no. Actually, once we are in State P, each subsequent write can either be S (stopping with PS) or P (continuing in P). So, it's a geometric distribution where each trial has success probability 2/5 (writing S) and failure probability 3/5 (writing P).   Therefore, the probability of eventually writing an S after being in State P is 1, because the trials are infinite and the probability of eventually succeeding is 1.   However, in our case, the process stops as soon as we write an S after P, which is PS. So, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first write is P, and then eventually, we write an S.   But actually, since the process stops as soon as we write an S after P, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first write is P, and then in the subsequent writes, we eventually write an S.   However, since the process can only stop when either SS, SP, or PS occurs, and once we are in State P, the only way to stop is by writing an S, which would be PS.   Therefore, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first write is P, and then eventually, we write an S.   But since the process can continue indefinitely, the probability of eventually writing an S is 1, but in our case, we need to calculate the probability that the first stopping condition is PS, which is the first time we have a square after some primes.   Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of expected probabilities.   Let me denote:   - Let‚Äôs define P_PS as the probability that the process stops with PS.   To calculate P_PS, we can consider that starting from State Start, the first write is P with probability 3/5, and then from State P, we can either stop by writing S with probability 2/5 or stay in P with probability 3/5.   So, the probability P_PS can be expressed as:   P_PS = (3/5) * [ (2/5) + (3/5) * P_PS ]   Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.   Actually, once we are in State P, the probability of eventually stopping with PS is the probability of writing S before writing another P that leads to continuing.   But since each time we are in State P, we have a 2/5 chance to stop with PS and a 3/5 chance to stay in P.   Therefore, the probability of eventually stopping with PS from State P is:   P_PS = (2/5) + (3/5) * P_PS   Solving for P_PS:   P_PS - (3/5) * P_PS = 2/5   (2/5) * P_PS = 2/5   P_PS = 1   Wait, that can't be right because it suggests that starting from State P, we will always eventually stop with PS, which is true because the probability of eventually writing an S is 1 in an infinite process. However, in our case, the process stops when either SS, SP, or PS occurs. So, starting from State P, the only way to stop is by writing an S, which is PS. Therefore, the probability of stopping with PS from State P is indeed 1.   However, this seems contradictory because the process could also stop with SP or SS before reaching PS. Wait, no. Because once we are in State P, the only way to stop is by writing an S, which would be PS. If we write another P, we stay in P. So, starting from State P, the process will eventually stop with PS with probability 1.   Therefore, the probability of stopping with PS is the probability that the first write is P, which is 3/5, and then from State P, we will eventually stop with PS with probability 1. So, P_PS = 3/5 * 1 = 3/5.   Wait, but that can't be right because the total probability of stopping with SS, SP, or PS should add up to 1. Let's check:   P_SS = 4/25 ‚âà 0.16   P_SP = 6/25 ‚âà 0.24   P_PS = 3/5 = 0.6   Adding them up: 0.16 + 0.24 + 0.6 = 1. So, that seems to add up.   But wait, is that correct? Because P_PS is 3/5, which is 15/25, and P_SS is 4/25, P_SP is 6/25, so total is 4 + 6 + 15 = 25, which is correct.   However, intuitively, it seems that P_PS should be higher than P_SS and P_SP because starting from Start, there's a higher chance to go to P first.   But let me verify this step-by-step.10. **Verifying the Calculations:**    Let me re-examine the calculation of P_PS.    Starting from Start, the first write can be S or P.    - If it's S (probability 2/5), then the next write will determine the stopping condition:      - Next write S: stop with SS (probability 2/5)      - Next write P: stop with SP (probability 3/5)    - If it's P (probability 3/5), then we are in State P, and we need to write an S to stop with PS. The probability of eventually writing an S from State P is 1, as discussed earlier.    Therefore, the total probability of stopping with PS is 3/5.    The total probability of stopping with SS is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.    The total probability of stopping with SP is (2/5) * (3/5) = 6/25.    Adding these up: 4/25 + 6/25 + 15/25 = 25/25 = 1, which checks out.    Therefore, the probability that Andrew stops after writing squares consecutively is 4/25.    Wait, but earlier I thought P_PS was 3/5, which is 15/25, but that's the probability of stopping with PS. The question asks for the probability that he stops after writing squares consecutively, which is P_SS = 4/25.    So, the answer should be 4/25.    But let me think again to make sure.11. **Double-Checking the Approach:**    Another way to approach this is to consider all possible sequences of writes until the stopping condition is met.    The stopping condition is met when either SS, SP, or PS occurs.    We need to find the probability that the first occurrence is SS.    So, we can model this as a probability of the first occurrence of SS, SP, or PS being SS.    This is similar to the problem of finding the probability that the first occurrence of either HH, HT, or TH in coin flips is HH.    In that classic problem, the probability is 1/3, but that's because the probabilities of H and T are equal. In our case, the probabilities are different.    Let me recall that in the coin flip problem, the probability of the first occurrence being HH is 1/3, HT is 1/3, and TH is 1/3, but that's when P(H) = P(T) = 1/2.    In our case, P(S) = 2/5 and P(P) = 3/5.    So, we need to generalize the approach.    Let me denote:    - P_SS: probability that the first occurrence is SS    - P_SP: probability that the first occurrence is SP    - P_PS: probability that the first occurrence is PS    We need to find P_SS.    To find P_SS, we can set up equations based on the possible states.    Let me define:    - Let‚Äôs denote the probability of eventually stopping with SS starting from State Start as P_SS.    - Similarly, P_SP and P_PS.    However, since the process can only stop when either SS, SP, or PS occurs, and these are mutually exclusive, we have P_SS + P_SP + P_PS = 1.    But we need to find P_SS.    Let me think of it as follows:    Starting from Start:    - With probability 2/5, we write S and move to State S.    - With probability 3/5, we write P and move to State P.    From State S:    - With probability 2/5, we write S and stop with SS.    - With probability 3/5, we write P and stop with SP.    From State P:    - With probability 2/5, we write S and stop with PS.    - With probability 3/5, we write P and stay in State P.    Therefore, we can write the following equations:    Let‚Äôs denote:    - P_SS: probability starting from Start to stop with SS    - P_SP: probability starting from Start to stop with SP    - P_PS: probability starting from Start to stop with PS    From Start:    P_SS = (2/5) * [ (2/5) * 1 + (3/5) * 0 ] + (3/5) * 0    Wait, no. That's not correct.    Let me think differently.    Let me define:    - Let‚Äôs denote A as the probability of stopping with SS starting from Start.    - Let‚Äôs denote B as the probability of stopping with SS starting from State S.    - Let‚Äôs denote C as the probability of stopping with SS starting from State P.    Wait, actually, since once we are in State S, the next step will stop, either with SS or SP. So, from State S, the probability of stopping with SS is 2/5, and with SP is 3/5.    Similarly, from State P, the probability of stopping with PS is 2/5, and with staying in P is 3/5.    Therefore, starting from Start, the probability of stopping with SS is:    A = P(SS from Start) = P(first write S) * P(SS from S) + P(first write P) * P(SS from P)    But from State P, we can't get to SS directly; we can only get to PS or stay in P.    Wait, actually, once we are in State P, we can only stop with PS or continue in P. So, from State P, the probability of eventually stopping with SS is 0, because we can only stop with PS.    Similarly, from State S, the probability of stopping with SS is 2/5, and with SP is 3/5.    Therefore, starting from Start:    A = P(first write S) * P(SS from S) + P(first write P) * P(SS from P)    A = (2/5) * (2/5) + (3/5) * 0    A = 4/25    Similarly, the probability of stopping with SP is:    B = (2/5) * (3/5) + (3/5) * 0 = 6/25    And the probability of stopping with PS is:    C = (3/5) * 1 + (2/5) * 0 = 3/5    Wait, but that doesn't add up because 4/25 + 6/25 + 3/5 = 4/25 + 6/25 + 15/25 = 25/25 = 1, which is correct.    Therefore, the probability of stopping with SS is 4/25.    So, the answer is 4/25.    But let me think again to make sure I haven't missed anything.12. **Alternative Approach Using Expected Values:**    Another way to approach this is to consider the expected number of steps or the probability generating functions, but that might be more complicated.    Alternatively, we can think of the problem as a race between the events SS, SP, and PS. We need to find the probability that SS occurs before SP or PS.    However, since SP and PS are different events, and they can occur in different ways, it's not a straightforward race.    But given the earlier analysis, where starting from Start, the probability of stopping with SS is 4/25, I think that is correct.13. **Conclusion:**    After carefully considering the states and transitions, and setting up the equations accordingly, the probability that Andrew stops after writing squares consecutively is 4/25."},{"question":"Given the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 with a > 0, b > 0 and its left and right foci denoted by F_1 and F_2 respectively, point P(3, frac{5}{2}) lies on the hyperbola. If the radius of the incircle of triangle triangle PF_1F_2 is 1, find the equation of the hyperbola.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a > 0) and (b > 0). The foci are (F_1) and (F_2), which are the left and right foci respectively. There's a point (P(3, frac{5}{2})) on the hyperbola, and the radius of the incircle of triangle (PF_1F_2) is 1. I need to find the equation of the hyperbola.First, I remember that for a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is (2c), where (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}). So, the coordinates of the foci (F_1) and (F_2) should be ((-c, 0)) and ((c, 0)) respectively.Since point (P(3, frac{5}{2})) lies on the hyperbola, it must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, plugging in the coordinates of (P) into the equation:[frac{3^2}{a^2} - frac{left(frac{5}{2}right)^2}{b^2} = 1]Simplifying that:[frac{9}{a^2} - frac{25}{4b^2} = 1]I'll keep this equation aside for now.Next, the problem mentions the radius of the incircle of triangle (PF_1F_2) is 1. I need to recall some properties about triangles and incircles. The radius (r) of the incircle of a triangle is related to the area (S) and the semiperimeter (s) by the formula:[r = frac{S}{s}]Given that (r = 1), so (S = s).First, let's find the area (S) of triangle (PF_1F_2). The base of the triangle can be considered as the distance between (F_1) and (F_2), which is (2c). The height would be the y-coordinate of point (P), which is (frac{5}{2}). So, the area is:[S = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2c times frac{5}{2} = frac{5c}{2}]So, (S = frac{5c}{2}).Now, the semiperimeter (s) is half the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The sides are (PF_1), (PF_2), and (F_1F_2). I need to find expressions for (PF_1) and (PF_2).Using the distance formula, (PF_1) is the distance between (P(3, frac{5}{2})) and (F_1(-c, 0)):[PF_1 = sqrt{(3 + c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2} - 0right)^2} = sqrt{(3 + c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2}right)^2}]Similarly, (PF_2) is the distance between (P(3, frac{5}{2})) and (F_2(c, 0)):[PF_2 = sqrt{(3 - c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2} - 0right)^2} = sqrt{(3 - c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2}right)^2}]And (F_1F_2) is simply (2c).So, the semiperimeter (s) is:[s = frac{PF_1 + PF_2 + 2c}{2}]Given that (S = s), because (r = 1), so:[frac{5c}{2} = frac{PF_1 + PF_2 + 2c}{2}]Multiplying both sides by 2:[5c = PF_1 + PF_2 + 2c]Subtracting (2c) from both sides:[3c = PF_1 + PF_2]So, (PF_1 + PF_2 = 3c).But wait, for a hyperbola, the definition is that the absolute difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to (2a). So, (|PF_1 - PF_2| = 2a).But in this case, we have (PF_1 + PF_2 = 3c). Hmm, so we have two equations:1. (PF_1 + PF_2 = 3c)2. (|PF_1 - PF_2| = 2a)Let me denote (PF_1 = d_1) and (PF_2 = d_2). So,1. (d_1 + d_2 = 3c)2. (|d_1 - d_2| = 2a)Assuming (d_1 > d_2), then (d_1 - d_2 = 2a). So, we have:1. (d_1 + d_2 = 3c)2. (d_1 - d_2 = 2a)Adding these two equations:(2d_1 = 3c + 2a) => (d_1 = frac{3c + 2a}{2})Subtracting the second equation from the first:(2d_2 = 3c - 2a) => (d_2 = frac{3c - 2a}{2})So, (PF_1 = frac{3c + 2a}{2}) and (PF_2 = frac{3c - 2a}{2}).But we also have expressions for (PF_1) and (PF_2) in terms of (c). Let me write them again:[PF_1 = sqrt{(3 + c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{(3 + c)^2 + frac{25}{4}}][PF_2 = sqrt{(3 - c)^2 + left(frac{5}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{(3 - c)^2 + frac{25}{4}}]So, we can set up the equations:[sqrt{(3 + c)^2 + frac{25}{4}} = frac{3c + 2a}{2}][sqrt{(3 - c)^2 + frac{25}{4}} = frac{3c - 2a}{2}]Let me square both sides of the first equation to eliminate the square root:[(3 + c)^2 + frac{25}{4} = left(frac{3c + 2a}{2}right)^2]Similarly, for the second equation:[(3 - c)^2 + frac{25}{4} = left(frac{3c - 2a}{2}right)^2]Let me expand both sides of the first equation:Left side:[(3 + c)^2 + frac{25}{4} = 9 + 6c + c^2 + frac{25}{4} = c^2 + 6c + 9 + 6.25 = c^2 + 6c + 15.25]Wait, actually, 9 is 9, and 25/4 is 6.25, so 9 + 6.25 is 15.25. So, left side is (c^2 + 6c + 15.25).Right side:[left(frac{3c + 2a}{2}right)^2 = frac{(3c + 2a)^2}{4} = frac{9c^2 + 12ac + 4a^2}{4}]So, equation becomes:[c^2 + 6c + 15.25 = frac{9c^2 + 12ac + 4a^2}{4}]Multiply both sides by 4:[4c^2 + 24c + 61 = 9c^2 + 12ac + 4a^2]Bring all terms to one side:[4c^2 + 24c + 61 - 9c^2 - 12ac - 4a^2 = 0]Simplify:[-5c^2 + 24c + 61 - 12ac - 4a^2 = 0]Let me write it as:[-5c^2 - 12ac - 4a^2 + 24c + 61 = 0]Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can do the same for the second equation.Second equation:Left side:[(3 - c)^2 + frac{25}{4} = 9 - 6c + c^2 + 6.25 = c^2 - 6c + 15.25]Right side:[left(frac{3c - 2a}{2}right)^2 = frac{(3c - 2a)^2}{4} = frac{9c^2 - 12ac + 4a^2}{4}]So, equation becomes:[c^2 - 6c + 15.25 = frac{9c^2 - 12ac + 4a^2}{4}]Multiply both sides by 4:[4c^2 - 24c + 61 = 9c^2 - 12ac + 4a^2]Bring all terms to one side:[4c^2 - 24c + 61 - 9c^2 + 12ac - 4a^2 = 0]Simplify:[-5c^2 + 12ac - 4a^2 - 24c + 61 = 0]So, now we have two equations:1. (-5c^2 - 12ac - 4a^2 + 24c + 61 = 0)2. (-5c^2 + 12ac - 4a^2 - 24c + 61 = 0)Let me subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate some terms.Equation 1 - Equation 2:[(-5c^2 - 12ac - 4a^2 + 24c + 61) - (-5c^2 + 12ac - 4a^2 - 24c + 61) = 0]Simplify term by term:- ( -5c^2 - (-5c^2) = 0 )- ( -12ac - 12ac = -24ac )- ( -4a^2 - (-4a^2) = 0 )- ( 24c - (-24c) = 48c )- ( 61 - 61 = 0 )So, the result is:[-24ac + 48c = 0]Factor out 24c:[24c(-a + 2) = 0]Since (c) cannot be zero (as (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}) and (a, b > 0)), we have:[-a + 2 = 0 implies a = 2]Great, so (a = 2). Now, let's plug this back into one of the equations to find (c).Let me take equation 2:[-5c^2 + 12ac - 4a^2 - 24c + 61 = 0]Substitute (a = 2):[-5c^2 + 12*2*c - 4*(2)^2 - 24c + 61 = 0]Simplify:[-5c^2 + 24c - 16 - 24c + 61 = 0]Simplify terms:- (24c - 24c = 0)- (-5c^2)- (-16 + 61 = 45)So, equation becomes:[-5c^2 + 45 = 0]Solving for (c^2):[-5c^2 = -45 implies c^2 = 9 implies c = 3]Since (c > 0), (c = 3).Now, since (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}), and we know (a = 2) and (c = 3), we can find (b):[c^2 = a^2 + b^2 implies 9 = 4 + b^2 implies b^2 = 5 implies b = sqrt{5}]So, (b = sqrt{5}).Now, let's verify if point (P(3, frac{5}{2})) lies on the hyperbola with (a = 2) and (b = sqrt{5}):[frac{3^2}{2^2} - frac{left(frac{5}{2}right)^2}{(sqrt{5})^2} = frac{9}{4} - frac{frac{25}{4}}{5} = frac{9}{4} - frac{25}{20} = frac{9}{4} - frac{5}{4} = frac{4}{4} = 1]Yes, it satisfies the equation.So, the equation of the hyperbola is:[frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{5} = 1]**Final Answer**The equation of the hyperbola is boxed{dfrac{x^2}{4} - dfrac{y^2}{5} = 1}."},{"question":"A teacher gives out a test of 30 problems.

I need to find cot^4 x + cot^2 x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. So, if cos x, sin x, tan x are in a geometric sequence, then the ratio between sin x and cos x should be the same as the ratio between tan x and sin x.Mathematically, that means:sin x / cos x = tan x / sin xLet me write that down:sin x / cos x = tan x / sin xI know that tan x is sin x / cos x, so I can substitute that into the equation:sin x / cos x = (sin x / cos x) / sin xSimplify the right side:(sin x / cos x) / sin x = (sin x / cos x) * (1 / sin x) = 1 / cos xSo now the equation becomes:sin x / cos x = 1 / cos xHmm, that's interesting. Let me write that again:sin x / cos x = 1 / cos xIf I multiply both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ‚â† 0), I get:sin x = 1So, sin x = 1. That means x is œÄ/2 + 2œÄk, where k is any integer. Let me check if this makes sense.If sin x = 1, then cos x = 0, because sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1. So, cos x = 0. But wait, if cos x is 0, then tan x is sin x / cos x, which would be undefined because we can't divide by zero. That's a problem because tan x is part of the geometric sequence, and if it's undefined, the sequence isn't valid.So, does that mean there's no solution? Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.Let me go back to the original equation:sin x / cos x = tan x / sin xI substituted tan x as sin x / cos x, which is correct. Then I simplified and got sin x = 1. But that leads to cos x = 0, which makes tan x undefined. So, maybe there's another way to approach this.Wait, perhaps I should consider that if cos x, sin x, tan x form a geometric sequence, then the ratio between consecutive terms is the same. So, the ratio r is sin x / cos x, and also tan x / sin x. So, setting them equal:sin x / cos x = tan x / sin xBut tan x is sin x / cos x, so substituting:sin x / cos x = (sin x / cos x) / sin xSimplify the right side:(sin x / cos x) / sin x = 1 / cos xSo, sin x / cos x = 1 / cos xMultiplying both sides by cos x (again, assuming cos x ‚â† 0):sin x = 1Which brings me back to the same problem. So, sin x = 1 implies cos x = 0, which makes tan x undefined. Therefore, there is no solution where all three terms are defined and form a geometric sequence.But the problem says they do form a geometric sequence, so maybe I need to consider the case where cos x = 0. If cos x = 0, then sin x would be ¬±1, but then tan x is undefined. So, again, the sequence would have an undefined term, which doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps instead of setting the ratios equal, I should consider the general form of a geometric sequence. Let me denote the terms as a, ar, ar^2, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.So, in this case:a = cos xar = sin xar^2 = tan xSo, from the first two terms:ar = sin x => r = sin x / cos xFrom the second and third terms:ar^2 = tan x => ar^2 = sin x / cos xBut ar^2 is also equal to (ar) * r = sin x * rSo, sin x * r = sin x / cos xSince sin x is not zero (because if sin x were zero, tan x would be zero, but then the sequence would be cos x, 0, 0, which is a geometric sequence with r=0, but let's check that case too), but let's assume sin x ‚â† 0 for now.So, sin x * r = sin x / cos xDivide both sides by sin x (since sin x ‚â† 0):r = 1 / cos xBut earlier, we had r = sin x / cos xSo, setting them equal:sin x / cos x = 1 / cos xMultiply both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ‚â† 0):sin x = 1Again, same result. So, sin x = 1, which leads to cos x = 0, making tan x undefined. So, this seems to be a dead end.Wait, maybe I should consider the case where sin x = 0. If sin x = 0, then the sequence becomes cos x, 0, 0. Is that a geometric sequence? Well, in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio. So, starting with cos x, then 0, then 0. The ratio would be 0 / cos x = 0, and then 0 / 0 is undefined. So, actually, it's not a valid geometric sequence because the common ratio is undefined after the second term.Therefore, sin x cannot be zero either. So, it seems like there is no solution where cos x, sin x, tan x form a geometric sequence with all terms defined.But the problem states that they do form a geometric sequence, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I need to consider complex numbers or something else, but the problem doesn't specify. It's likely intended to be a real number problem.Wait, another thought: maybe the common ratio is negative? Let me check.If cos x, sin x, tan x are in geometric sequence, then:sin x = cos x * rtan x = sin x * r = cos x * r^2But tan x is sin x / cos x, so:cos x * r^2 = sin x / cos xBut sin x = cos x * r, so substitute:cos x * r^2 = (cos x * r) / cos x = rSo, cos x * r^2 = rAssuming r ‚â† 0, we can divide both sides by r:cos x * r = 1But from earlier, sin x = cos x * r, so sin x = 1Again, leading to sin x = 1, which causes cos x = 0, making tan x undefined.So, same problem.Wait, if r = 0, then the sequence would be cos x, 0, 0. But as I thought earlier, this isn't a valid geometric sequence because the ratio after the second term is undefined.So, perhaps there is no solution? But the problem says they do form a geometric sequence, so maybe I need to find a value of x where cos x, sin x, tan x are in geometric progression despite tan x being undefined? That doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the limit as x approaches œÄ/2, but that's more calculus, and the problem seems to be algebraic.Wait, let me try squaring both sides to see if that helps. From the original equation:sin^2 x = cos x * tan xBut tan x = sin x / cos x, so:sin^2 x = cos x * (sin x / cos x) = sin xSo, sin^2 x = sin xWhich implies sin^2 x - sin x = 0sin x (sin x - 1) = 0So, sin x = 0 or sin x = 1Again, same results. If sin x = 0, then the sequence is cos x, 0, 0, which isn't a valid geometric sequence. If sin x = 1, then cos x = 0, making tan x undefined. So, no valid solution.But the problem says they form a geometric sequence, so maybe I need to consider that the common ratio is infinite or something? That seems beyond the scope.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that even though tan x is undefined, we can still find cot^4 x + cot^2 x in some way. Let me see.If sin x = 1, then cos x = 0, so cot x = cos x / sin x = 0 / 1 = 0. Wait, no, cot x is cos x / sin x, so if cos x = 0, cot x = 0. But wait, if sin x = 1, then cot x = 0. So, cot^2 x = 0, and cot^4 x = 0. So, 0 + 0 = 0.But wait, earlier I thought that if sin x = 1, then cos x = 0, making tan x undefined, but cot x would be 0. So, maybe the answer is 0.But wait, let me double-check. If sin x = 1, then cos x = 0, so cot x = 0 / 1 = 0. So, cot^2 x = 0, cot^4 x = 0. So, 0 + 0 = 0.But earlier, I thought that the sequence would be cos x, sin x, tan x, which would be 0, 1, undefined. So, it's not a valid geometric sequence because tan x is undefined. But the problem says they do form a geometric sequence, so maybe we have to accept that tan x is undefined and still compute cot^4 x + cot^2 x as 0.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that even though tan x is undefined, the expression cot^4 x + cot^2 x is 0.Wait, but if tan x is undefined, then x is œÄ/2 + kœÄ, where k is integer. At those points, sin x = ¬±1, cos x = 0, so cot x = 0. So, cot^2 x = 0, cot^4 x = 0. So, their sum is 0.But earlier, I thought that the sequence isn't valid because tan x is undefined, but maybe the problem is designed such that we proceed despite that, and the answer is 0.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that sin x = 1 is the only solution. Let me check.From sin^2 x = sin x, we have sin x = 0 or sin x = 1. But if sin x = 0, then the sequence is cos x, 0, 0. Is that a geometric sequence? Well, the ratio would be 0 / cos x = 0, and then 0 / 0 is undefined. So, it's not a valid geometric sequence because the common ratio is undefined after the second term.So, the only possible solution is sin x = 1, which makes tan x undefined, but cot x = 0. So, maybe the answer is 0.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that even though tan x is undefined, we can still compute cot^4 x + cot^2 x as 0.So, perhaps the answer is 0.But I'm a bit confused because the sequence isn't valid in that case. Maybe the problem is designed to have us proceed despite that, and the answer is 0.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the common ratio is infinity, but that's not a real number.Wait, another approach: maybe instead of setting the ratios equal, I can express everything in terms of cot x.Let me denote cot x as c. Then, cos x = c * sin x, because cot x = cos x / sin x.Also, tan x = 1 / cot x = 1 / c.So, the sequence is cos x, sin x, tan x, which is c sin x, sin x, 1 / c.Since it's a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.So, sin x / (c sin x) = (1 / c) / sin xSimplify:1 / c = (1 / c) / sin xMultiply both sides by c:1 = 1 / sin xSo, sin x = 1Again, same result. So, sin x = 1, which leads to cos x = 0, tan x undefined, but cot x = 0. So, cot^4 x + cot^2 x = 0 + 0 = 0.So, maybe the answer is 0.But I'm still a bit unsure because the sequence isn't valid in that case. However, the problem states that they do form a geometric sequence, so perhaps we have to accept that and proceed.Therefore, the answer is 0."},{"question":"Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.

The first snail's speed is given as 2 feet per minute. The second snail races at twice the speed of the first snail, which means its speed is 4 feet per minute. The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail, resulting in a speed of 20 feet per minute.Next, I'll calculate the total distance of the sidewalk using the first snail's speed and the time it took to complete the race. The distance is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time: 2 feet per minute multiplied by 20 minutes equals 40 feet.Finally, to find out how long it took the third snail to race up the sidewalk, I'll divide the total distance by the third snail's speed: 40 feet divided by 20 feet per minute equals 2 minutes."},{"question":"Charlie has 75% more apples than Dana, and Bella has 50% more apples than Dana.

Hmm, coplanar means all four points lie on the same plane. I remember that one way to determine if four points are coplanar is by checking if the volume of the tetrahedron formed by these points is zero. If the volume is zero, they lie on the same plane.To find the volume, I can use the scalar triple product of vectors. The scalar triple product of three vectors gives the volume of the parallelepiped formed by them, and if it's zero, the vectors are coplanar. So, I need to form three vectors from the given points and compute their scalar triple product.Let me denote the points as ( A(0,0,0) ), ( B(1,b,0) ), ( C(0,1,b^2) ), and ( D(b^2,0,1) ). Then, the vectors I can form are ( overrightarrow{AB} ), ( overrightarrow{AC} ), and ( overrightarrow{AD} ).Calculating these vectors:- ( overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (1-0, b-0, 0-0) = (1, b, 0) )- ( overrightarrow{AC} = C - A = (0-0, 1-0, b^2-0) = (0, 1, b^2) )- ( overrightarrow{AD} = D - A = (b^2-0, 0-0, 1-0) = (b^2, 0, 1) )So, the vectors are:[mathbf{u} = begin{pmatrix} 1  b  0 end{pmatrix}, quad mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} 0  1  b^2 end{pmatrix}, quad mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} b^2  0  1 end{pmatrix}]The scalar triple product is given by the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows). So, I need to compute the determinant of the matrix:[begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & b^2 b & 1 & 0 0 & b^2 & 1end{pmatrix}]Let me write this determinant out:[begin{vmatrix}1 & 0 & b^2 b & 1 & 0 0 & b^2 & 1end{vmatrix}]To compute this determinant, I can use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Maybe cofactor expansion along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify calculations.Expanding along the first row:[1 cdot begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0  b^2 & 1 end{vmatrix} - 0 cdot begin{vmatrix} b & 0  0 & 1 end{vmatrix} + b^2 cdot begin{vmatrix} b & 1  0 & b^2 end{vmatrix}]Calculating each minor:1. The first minor is:[begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0  b^2 & 1 end{vmatrix} = (1)(1) - (0)(b^2) = 1 - 0 = 1]2. The second minor is multiplied by zero, so it doesn't contribute anything.3. The third minor is:[begin{vmatrix} b & 1  0 & b^2 end{vmatrix} = (b)(b^2) - (1)(0) = b^3 - 0 = b^3]Putting it all together:[1 cdot 1 + 0 + b^2 cdot b^3 = 1 + b^5]So, the determinant is ( 1 + b^5 ). For the points to be coplanar, this determinant must be zero:[1 + b^5 = 0]Solving for ( b ):[b^5 = -1]Taking the fifth root of both sides:[b = sqrt[5]{-1}]Since we're dealing with real numbers, the fifth root of -1 is just -1 because ( (-1)^5 = -1 ). So, ( b = -1 ).Wait, but should I consider complex roots as well? The problem doesn't specify, but since we're dealing with coordinates in 3D space, which are typically real numbers, I think only the real solution is relevant here. So, ( b = -1 ) is the only solution.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The determinant expansion seems correct. The minors were calculated properly, and the multiplication by the respective elements of the first row was done correctly. So, ( 1 + b^5 = 0 ) leading to ( b = -1 ) seems right.Just to be thorough, let me plug ( b = -1 ) back into the determinant to verify:[1 + (-1)^5 = 1 - 1 = 0]Yes, that works. So, the only real value of ( b ) that makes the points coplanar is ( -1 ).I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that ( b = -1 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( b ) is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"A and B start walking towards each other at 1 pm at speeds of 5 kmph and 7 kmph, respectively.

A's speed is reduced by 1 km/h due to the wind, making their effective speed 4 km/h.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that if a number is divisible by 14, it must be divisible by both 2 and 7. That means the number should be an even number and also a multiple of 7. So, I'm looking for a number that satisfies both these conditions.Next, the square root of this number needs to be between 25 and 25.3. To find the range of the number itself, I can square these bounds. Let's calculate:Lower bound: 25 squared is 625.Upper bound: 25.3 squared is approximately 640.09.So, the number I'm looking for should be between 625 and 640.09. Since we're dealing with integers, the number must be between 625 and 640.Now, I need to find a multiple of 14 within this range. Let's list the multiples of 14 around this area to see which ones fall within 625 to 640.Starting from 625, let's divide 625 by 14 to see where we are:625 √∑ 14 ‚âà 44.64So, the next whole number multiple would be 45 √ó 14. Let's calculate that:45 √ó 14 = 630Okay, 630 is within our range of 625 to 640. Let's check the next multiple to see if there's another one:46 √ó 14 = 644644 is above our upper bound of 640.09, so it's outside the range. Therefore, 630 is the only multiple of 14 between 625 and 640.Let me double-check to make sure 630 fits both conditions:- Is 630 divisible by 14? Yes, because 630 √∑ 14 = 45, which is an integer.- Does 630 have a square root between 25 and 25.3? Let's calculate the square root of 630.‚àö630 ‚âà 25.125.1 is indeed between 25 and 25.3.

Hmm, that looks pretty complicated at first glance. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that the expression (x^{2} + 6x - 6) is repeated multiple times. Maybe I can simplify this by substituting it with another variable. Let me call this expression (f(x)), so (f(x) = x^{2} + 6x - 6). That should make the equation a bit easier to handle.Substituting (f(x)) into the original equation, it becomes:[f(f(x)) + 6f(x) - 6 = x]Wait, so (f(f(x))) means I'm plugging (f(x)) back into itself. That would be:[f(f(x)) = (f(x))^{2} + 6f(x) - 6]So, substituting back into the equation:[(f(x))^{2} + 6f(x) - 6 + 6f(x) - 6 = x]Simplifying this, I combine like terms:[(f(x))^{2} + 12f(x) - 12 = x]Now, since (f(x) = x^{2} + 6x - 6), I can substitute that back in:[(x^{2} + 6x - 6)^{2} + 12(x^{2} + 6x - 6) - 12 = x]Hmm, this still looks quite messy. Maybe expanding the squared term would help. Let's try that.First, expand ((x^{2} + 6x - 6)^{2}):[(x^{2} + 6x - 6)(x^{2} + 6x - 6)]Multiplying term by term:- (x^{2} times x^{2} = x^{4})- (x^{2} times 6x = 6x^{3})- (x^{2} times (-6) = -6x^{2})- (6x times x^{2} = 6x^{3})- (6x times 6x = 36x^{2})- (6x times (-6) = -36x)- (-6 times x^{2} = -6x^{2})- (-6 times 6x = -36x)- (-6 times (-6) = 36)Now, combine all these terms:[x^{4} + 6x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 6x^{3} + 36x^{2} - 36x - 6x^{2} - 36x + 36]Combine like terms:- (x^{4})- (6x^{3} + 6x^{3} = 12x^{3})- (-6x^{2} + 36x^{2} - 6x^{2} = 24x^{2})- (-36x - 36x = -72x)- (36)So, the expanded form of ((x^{2} + 6x - 6)^{2}) is:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36]Now, let's plug this back into our equation:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36 + 12(x^{2} + 6x - 6) - 12 = x]Next, expand the (12(x^{2} + 6x - 6)) term:[12x^{2} + 72x - 72]Now, substitute this back into the equation:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36 + 12x^{2} + 72x - 72 - 12 = x]Combine like terms:- (x^{4})- (12x^{3})- (24x^{2} + 12x^{2} = 36x^{2})- (-72x + 72x = 0x)- (36 - 72 - 12 = -48)So, the equation simplifies to:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 36x^{2} - 48 = x]Let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 36x^{2} - x - 48 = 0]Hmm, now I have a quartic equation. Quartic equations can be quite challenging to solve, but maybe I can factor this or find rational roots.Let's try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -48, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, possible rational roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±3, ¬±4, ¬±6, ¬±8, ¬±12, ¬±16, ¬±24, ¬±48.Let me test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation.First, test (x = 1):[1^{4} + 12(1)^{3} + 36(1)^{2} - 1 - 48 = 1 + 12 + 36 - 1 - 48 = 0]Wow, (x = 1) is a root!Next, test (x = -6):[(-6)^{4} + 12(-6)^{3} + 36(-6)^{2} - (-6) - 48 = 1296 - 1296 + 1296 + 6 - 48 = 1296 - 1296 = 0]Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.Wait, let me check (x = -6) again:[(-6)^4 = 1296 12(-6)^3 = 12(-216) = -2592 36(-6)^2 = 36(36) = 1296 -(-6) = 6 -48 = -48 So, total: 1296 - 2592 + 1296 + 6 - 48 = (1296 + 1296) + (-2592) + (6 - 48) = 2592 - 2592 + (-42) = -42]Yes, it's -42, not zero. So, (x = -6) is not a root.Wait, but earlier when I thought (x = -6) was a root, I must have miscalculated. Let me try (x = -6) again carefully.Wait, maybe I confused it with another root. Let me try (x = -4):[(-4)^4 = 256 12(-4)^3 = 12(-64) = -768 36(-4)^2 = 36(16) = 576 -(-4) = 4 -48 = -48 Total: 256 - 768 + 576 + 4 - 48 = (256 + 576) + (-768) + (4 - 48) = 832 - 768 + (-44) = 64 - 44 = 20 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = 2):[2^4 = 16 12(2)^3 = 12(8) = 96 36(2)^2 = 36(4) = 144 -2 = -2 -48 = -48 Total: 16 + 96 + 144 - 2 - 48 = (16 + 96 + 144) + (-2 - 48) = 256 - 50 = 206 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = 3):[3^4 = 81 12(3)^3 = 12(27) = 324 36(3)^2 = 36(9) = 324 -3 = -3 -48 = -48 Total: 81 + 324 + 324 - 3 - 48 = (81 + 324 + 324) + (-3 - 48) = 729 - 51 = 678 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = -3):[(-3)^4 = 81 12(-3)^3 = 12(-27) = -324 36(-3)^2 = 36(9) = 324 -(-3) = 3 -48 = -48 Total: 81 - 324 + 324 + 3 - 48 = (81 + 324 + 3) + (-324 - 48) = 408 - 372 = 36 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = 4):[4^4 = 256 12(4)^3 = 12(64) = 768 36(4)^2 = 36(16) = 576 -4 = -4 -48 = -48 Total: 256 + 768 + 576 - 4 - 48 = (256 + 768 + 576) + (-4 - 48) = 1600 - 52 = 1548 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = -2):[(-2)^4 = 16 12(-2)^3 = 12(-8) = -96 36(-2)^2 = 36(4) = 144 -(-2) = 2 -48 = -48 Total: 16 - 96 + 144 + 2 - 48 = (16 + 144 + 2) + (-96 - 48) = 162 - 144 = 18 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = -1):[(-1)^4 = 1 12(-1)^3 = 12(-1) = -12 36(-1)^2 = 36(1) = 36 -(-1) = 1 -48 = -48 Total: 1 - 12 + 36 + 1 - 48 = (1 + 36 + 1) + (-12 - 48) = 38 - 60 = -22 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = 6):[6^4 = 1296 12(6)^3 = 12(216) = 2592 36(6)^2 = 36(36) = 1296 -6 = -6 -48 = -48 Total: 1296 + 2592 + 1296 - 6 - 48 = (1296 + 2592 + 1296) + (-6 - 48) = 5184 - 54 = 5130 neq 0]Not zero.How about (x = -8):[(-8)^4 = 4096 12(-8)^3 = 12(-512) = -6144 36(-8)^2 = 36(64) = 2304 -(-8) = 8 -48 = -48 Total: 4096 - 6144 + 2304 + 8 - 48 = (4096 + 2304 + 8) + (-6144 - 48) = 6408 - 6192 = 216 neq 0]Not zero.Hmm, so far, only (x = 1) is a root. Maybe there are other roots that are not rational. Since it's a quartic equation, there should be four roots in total (real or complex).Since I found (x = 1) is a root, I can factor out ((x - 1)) from the quartic equation.Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out ((x - 1)).Using synthetic division with (x = 1):Coefficients of the quartic equation: 1 (x^4), 12 (x^3), 36 (x^2), -1 (x), -48 (constant).Set up synthetic division:1 | 1 ¬†¬†12 ¬†¬†36 ¬†¬†-1 ¬†¬†-48Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: 12 + 1 = 13.Multiply 1 by 13: 13. Add to next coefficient: 36 + 13 = 49.Multiply 1 by 49: 49. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 49 = 48.Multiply 1 by 48: 48. Add to last coefficient: -48 + 48 = 0.So, the result is:1 ¬†¬†13 ¬†¬†49 ¬†¬†48Which corresponds to:(x^3 + 13x^2 + 49x + 48)So, the quartic equation factors as:[(x - 1)(x^3 + 13x^2 + 49x + 48) = 0]Now, I need to factor the cubic equation (x^3 + 13x^2 + 49x + 48).Again, let's try the Rational Root Theorem on the cubic equation. Possible rational roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±3, ¬±4, ¬±6, ¬±8, ¬±12, ¬±16, ¬±24, ¬±48.Test (x = -1):[(-1)^3 + 13(-1)^2 + 49(-1) + 48 = -1 + 13 - 49 + 48 = 11 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -3):[(-3)^3 + 13(-3)^2 + 49(-3) + 48 = -27 + 117 - 147 + 48 = (-27 + 117) + (-147 + 48) = 90 - 99 = -9 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -4):[(-4)^3 + 13(-4)^2 + 49(-4) + 48 = -64 + 208 - 196 + 48 = (-64 + 208) + (-196 + 48) = 144 - 148 = -4 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -6):[(-6)^3 + 13(-6)^2 + 49(-6) + 48 = -216 + 468 - 294 + 48 = (-216 + 468) + (-294 + 48) = 252 - 246 = 6 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -8):[(-8)^3 + 13(-8)^2 + 49(-8) + 48 = -512 + 832 - 392 + 48 = (-512 + 832) + (-392 + 48) = 320 - 344 = -24 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -12):[(-12)^3 + 13(-12)^2 + 49(-12) + 48 = -1728 + 1872 - 588 + 48 = (-1728 + 1872) + (-588 + 48) = 144 - 540 = -396 neq 0]Not zero.Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe I made a mistake in the synthetic division earlier.Wait, let me double-check the synthetic division:Original quartic equation: (x^4 + 12x^3 + 36x^2 - x - 48)Using synthetic division with (x = 1):Bring down 1.1 * 1 = 1; 12 + 1 = 1313 * 1 = 13; 36 + 13 = 4949 * 1 = 49; -1 + 49 = 4848 * 1 = 48; -48 + 48 = 0Yes, that seems correct. So, the cubic is (x^3 + 13x^2 + 49x + 48).Since none of the rational roots are working, maybe this cubic can be factored by grouping or perhaps it has complex roots.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier in expanding the original equation. Let me go back and check.Original equation:[(x^{2} + 6x - 6)^{2} + 6(x^{2} + 6x - 6) - 6 = x]I expanded ((x^{2} + 6x - 6)^2) correctly to (x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36). Then, added (6(x^{2} + 6x - 6)) which is (6x^{2} + 36x - 36). So, total equation becomes:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36 + 6x^{2} + 36x - 36 - 6 = x]Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in combining the constants. Let me re-express this step:After expanding:[(x^{2} + 6x - 6)^2 = x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36]Then, (6(x^{2} + 6x - 6) = 6x^{2} + 36x - 36)So, adding these together and subtracting 6:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 36 + 6x^{2} + 36x - 36 - 6 = x]Now, combine like terms:- (x^{4})- (12x^{3})- (24x^{2} + 6x^{2} = 30x^{2})- (-72x + 36x = -36x)- (36 - 36 - 6 = -6)So, the equation simplifies to:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 30x^{2} - 36x - 6 = x]Wait, earlier I had (36x^{2}) instead of (30x^{2}). That was a mistake. So, correcting that, the equation is:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 30x^{2} - 36x - 6 = x]Now, move all terms to one side:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 30x^{2} - 37x - 6 = 0]Okay, so the quartic equation is actually:[x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 30x^{2} - 37x - 6 = 0]Now, let's try the Rational Root Theorem again on this corrected quartic equation.Possible rational roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±3, ¬±6, ¬±1/2, ¬±3/2, etc.Test (x = 1):[1 + 12 + 30 - 37 - 6 = 0]Yes, (x = 1) is still a root.Test (x = -1):[1 - 12 + 30 + 37 - 6 = 50 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -2):[16 - 96 + 120 + 74 - 6 = 118 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -3):[81 - 324 + 270 + 111 - 6 = 132 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -6):[1296 - 1296 + 1080 + 222 - 6 = 1296 - 1296 = 0; 1080 + 222 - 6 = 1296]Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate:[(-6)^4 = 1296 12(-6)^3 = 12(-216) = -2592 30(-6)^2 = 30(36) = 1080 -37(-6) = 222 -6 = -6 Total: 1296 - 2592 + 1080 + 222 - 6 = (1296 + 1080 + 222) + (-2592 - 6) = 2598 - 2600 = -2 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = 2):[16 + 96 + 120 - 74 - 6 = 152 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -1/2):[(1/16) + 12(-1/8) + 30(1/4) - 37(-1/2) - 6]This seems messy, but let's calculate:[(1/16) - (12/8) + (30/4) + (37/2) - 6 = 0.0625 - 1.5 + 7.5 + 18.5 - 6 = 0.0625 - 1.5 = -1.4375 -1.4375 + 7.5 = 6.0625 6.0625 + 18.5 = 24.5625 24.5625 - 6 = 18.5625 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = 3):[81 + 324 + 270 - 111 - 6 = 558 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -3/2):[(81/16) + 12(-27/8) + 30(9/4) - 37(-3/2) - 6]This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to factor out ((x - 1)) from the corrected quartic equation.Using synthetic division again with (x = 1):Coefficients: 1 (x^4), 12 (x^3), 30 (x^2), -37 (x), -6 (constant).Set up synthetic division:1 | 1 ¬†¬†12 ¬†¬†30 ¬†¬†-37 ¬†¬†-6Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: 12 + 1 = 13.Multiply 1 by 13: 13. Add to next coefficient: 30 + 13 = 43.Multiply 1 by 43: 43. Add to next coefficient: -37 + 43 = 6.Multiply 1 by 6: 6. Add to last coefficient: -6 + 6 = 0.So, the result is:1 ¬†¬†13 ¬†¬†43 ¬†¬†6Which corresponds to:(x^3 + 13x^2 + 43x + 6)So, the quartic equation factors as:[(x - 1)(x^3 + 13x^2 + 43x + 6) = 0]Now, I need to factor the cubic equation (x^3 + 13x^2 + 43x + 6).Again, using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±3, ¬±6, ¬±1/2, ¬±3/2, etc.Test (x = -1):[-1 + 13 - 43 + 6 = -25 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -2):[-8 + 52 - 86 + 6 = -36 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -3):[-27 + 117 - 129 + 6 = -33 neq 0]Not zero.Test (x = -6):[-216 + 468 - 258 + 6 = 0]Wait, let's calculate:[(-6)^3 = -216 13(-6)^2 = 13(36) = 468 43(-6) = -258 6 = 6 Total: -216 + 468 - 258 + 6 = (-216 + 468) + (-258 + 6) = 252 - 252 = 0]Yes! (x = -6) is a root.So, we can factor out ((x + 6)) from the cubic equation.Using synthetic division with (x = -6):Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 13 (x^2), 43 (x), 6 (constant).Set up synthetic division:-6 | 1 ¬†¬†13 ¬†¬†43 ¬†¬†6Bring down the 1.Multiply -6 by 1: -6. Add to next coefficient: 13 + (-6) = 7.Multiply -6 by 7: -42. Add to next coefficient: 43 + (-42) = 1.Multiply -6 by 1: -6. Add to last coefficient: 6 + (-6) = 0.So, the result is:1 ¬†¬†7 ¬†¬†1Which corresponds to:(x^2 + 7x + 1)So, the cubic factors as:[(x + 6)(x^2 + 7x + 1) = 0]Now, the quartic equation is fully factored as:[(x - 1)(x + 6)(x^2 + 7x + 1) = 0]So, the roots are:- (x = 1)- (x = -6)- Roots of (x^2 + 7x + 1 = 0)Let's solve (x^2 + 7x + 1 = 0) using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Here, (a = 1), (b = 7), (c = 1):[x = frac{-7 pm sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = frac{-7 pm sqrt{45}}{2} = frac{-7 pm 3sqrt{5}}{2}]So, the four roots of the quartic equation are:1. (x = 1)2. (x = -6)3. (x = frac{-7 + 3sqrt{5}}{2})4. (x = frac{-7 - 3sqrt{5}}{2})Now, I need to verify these roots in the original equation to ensure they are valid and not extraneous.First, test (x = 1):[(1^2 + 6(1) - 6)^2 + 6(1^2 + 6(1) - 6) - 6 = (1 + 6 - 6)^2 + 6(1 + 6 - 6) - 6 = (1)^2 + 6(1) - 6 = 1 + 6 - 6 = 1]Which equals (x = 1). So, valid.Next, test (x = -6):[((-6)^2 + 6(-6) - 6)^2 + 6((-6)^2 + 6(-6) - 6) - 6 = (36 - 36 - 6)^2 + 6(36 - 36 - 6) - 6 = (-6)^2 + 6(-6) - 6 = 36 - 36 - 6 = -6]Which equals (x = -6). So, valid.Now, test (x = frac{-7 + 3sqrt{5}}{2}). Let's denote this as (x = a).Compute (x^2 + 6x - 6):[a^2 + 6a - 6]Since (a) is a root of (x^2 + 7x + 1 = 0), we have:[a^2 = -7a - 1]So,[a^2 + 6a - 6 = (-7a - 1) + 6a - 6 = (-7a + 6a) + (-1 - 6) = -a - 7]Now, compute the original equation:[(-a - 7)^2 + 6(-a - 7) - 6 = a]Expand:[(a^2 + 14a + 49) + (-6a - 42) - 6 = a]Simplify:[a^2 + 14a + 49 - 6a - 42 - 6 = a a^2 + 8a + 1 = a a^2 + 7a + 1 = 0]Which is true because (a) is a root of (x^2 + 7x + 1 = 0). So, valid.Similarly, for (x = frac{-7 - 3sqrt{5}}{2}), the same steps apply, and it will satisfy the original equation.Therefore, all four roots are valid solutions to the original equation."},{"question":"Let Q be the plane passing through the origin with normal vector begin{pmatrix} 1  -2  2 end{pmatrix}. Find the matrix mathbf{S} such that for any vector mathbf{u}, mathbf{S} mathbf{u} is the reflection of mathbf{u} through plane Q.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the reflection matrix S that reflects any vector u through the plane Q. The plane Q passes through the origin and has a normal vector n = [1, -2, 2]. Hmm, reflections... I remember that reflecting a vector through a plane involves some projection. Let me think.First, reflection across a plane can be thought of as flipping the vector over the plane. So, if I have a vector u, its reflection s should be such that the plane Q is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining u and s. That means the midpoint between u and s lies on the plane Q.But how do I compute this reflection? I think it involves the normal vector of the plane. Maybe I can use the projection of u onto the normal vector n to find the component of u that's perpendicular to the plane. Then, subtracting twice that component from u should give me the reflection.Let me write this down step by step.1. **Projection onto the normal vector n:**   The projection of u onto n is given by:   [   text{proj}_n mathbf{u} = frac{mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{n}}{mathbf{n} cdot mathbf{n}} mathbf{n}   ]   So, if I compute this, I get the component of u that's in the direction of n.2. **Finding the reflection:**   Since reflection flips the component perpendicular to the plane, I need to subtract twice the projection from u. So, the reflection s is:   [   mathbf{s} = mathbf{u} - 2 times text{proj}_n mathbf{u}   ]   That makes sense because the projection is the distance from u to the plane, so subtracting twice that would flip it to the other side.3. **Expressing this as a matrix:**   To find the matrix S such that S * u = s, I need to express the reflection formula in terms of matrix multiplication.   Let me denote the projection matrix as P. Then,   [   text{proj}_n mathbf{u} = P mathbf{u}   ]   So, the reflection can be written as:   [   mathbf{s} = mathbf{u} - 2 P mathbf{u} = (I - 2P) mathbf{u}   ]   Therefore, the reflection matrix S is:   [   S = I - 2P   ]   Where I is the identity matrix.4. **Calculating the projection matrix P:**   The projection matrix onto n is given by:   [   P = frac{mathbf{n} mathbf{n}^T}{mathbf{n}^T mathbf{n}}   ]   Let me compute this.   First, compute n * n^T:   [   mathbf{n} mathbf{n}^T = begin{pmatrix} 1  -2  2 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix}   ]      Then, compute n^T * n:   [   mathbf{n}^T mathbf{n} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9   ]      So, the projection matrix P is:   [   P = frac{1}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix}   ]   5. **Constructing the reflection matrix S:**   Now, subtract 2P from the identity matrix I.   The identity matrix I is:   [   I = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}   ]      So, 2P is:   [   2P = frac{2}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} frac{2}{9} & -frac{4}{9} & frac{4}{9}  -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & -frac{8}{9}  frac{4}{9} & -frac{8}{9} & frac{8}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]      Now, subtracting 2P from I:   [   S = I - 2P = begin{pmatrix} 1 - frac{2}{9} & 0 + frac{4}{9} & 0 - frac{4}{9}  0 + frac{4}{9} & 1 - frac{8}{9} & 0 + frac{8}{9}  0 - frac{4}{9} & 0 + frac{8}{9} & 1 - frac{8}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]      Let me compute each element:   - First row:     - 1 - 2/9 = 7/9     - 0 + 4/9 = 4/9     - 0 - 4/9 = -4/9   - Second row:     - 0 + 4/9 = 4/9     - 1 - 8/9 = 1/9     - 0 + 8/9 = 8/9   - Third row:     - 0 - 4/9 = -4/9     - 0 + 8/9 = 8/9     - 1 - 8/9 = 1/9   Wait, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the subtraction.   Wait, no. The second row of I is [0, 1, 0], so subtracting 2P's second row:   0 - (-4/9) = 4/9   1 - 8/9 = 1/9   0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   Similarly, third row:   0 - 4/9 = -4/9   0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   1 - 8/9 = 1/9   Hmm, but in the initial calculation, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me write it again carefully.   The reflection matrix S is:   [   S = I - 2P = begin{pmatrix}   1 - frac{2}{9} & 0 - left(-frac{4}{9}right) & 0 - frac{4}{9}    0 - left(-frac{4}{9}right) & 1 - frac{8}{9} & 0 - left(-frac{8}{9}right)    0 - frac{4}{9} & 0 - left(-frac{8}{9}right) & 1 - frac{8}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   Calculating each element:   - First row:     - 1 - 2/9 = 7/9     - 0 - (-4/9) = 4/9     - 0 - 4/9 = -4/9   - Second row:     - 0 - (-4/9) = 4/9     - 1 - 8/9 = 1/9     - 0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   - Third row:     - 0 - 4/9 = -4/9     - 0 - (-8/9) = 8/9     - 1 - 8/9 = 1/9   Wait, that gives:   [   S = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   But looking back at the initial problem, the user provided a different matrix in their solution. Let me compare.   The user's solution had:   [   begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{5}{9} & -frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{5}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   Hmm, so in the second row, second and third elements are different. In my calculation, I have 1/9 and 8/9, but the user has 5/9 and -8/9.   Did I make a mistake in the subtraction?   Let me check again.   The projection matrix P is:   [   P = frac{1}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix}   ]   So, 2P is:   [   2P = frac{2}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} frac{2}{9} & -frac{4}{9} & frac{4}{9}  -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & -frac{8}{9}  frac{4}{9} & -frac{8}{9} & frac{8}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]   Then, I - 2P:   First row:   1 - 2/9 = 7/9   0 - (-4/9) = 4/9   0 - 4/9 = -4/9   Second row:   0 - (-4/9) = 4/9   1 - 8/9 = 1/9   0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   Third row:   0 - 4/9 = -4/9   0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   1 - 8/9 = 1/9   So, according to this, S is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   But the user's solution had different entries in the second and third rows. Maybe I made a mistake in the projection matrix.   Wait, let me check the projection formula again. The projection matrix onto n is indeed (n n^T)/(n^T n). So, n is [1, -2, 2], so n n^T is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   1*1 & 1*(-2) & 1*2    (-2)*1 & (-2)*(-2) & (-2)*2    2*1 & 2*(-2) & 2*2   end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix}   1 & -2 & 2    -2 & 4 & -4    2 & -4 & 4   end{pmatrix}   ]   So that's correct. Divided by 9, that's P.   So, 2P is correct as above.   Then, I - 2P is as I calculated.   But the user's solution had different entries. Maybe the user used a different approach, projecting onto the plane instead of subtracting twice the normal projection.   Wait, another way to think about reflection is that it's equal to 2 times the projection onto the plane minus the identity matrix. So, if Q is the projection onto the plane, then reflection S = 2Q - I.   Let me see if that gives the same result.   First, projection onto the plane Q can be found by subtracting the projection onto the normal vector from the identity matrix. So,   [   Q = I - P   ]      Therefore, reflection S = 2Q - I = 2(I - P) - I = 2I - 2P - I = I - 2P   So, same result. So, my approach is correct.   Hmm, so why does the user's solution have different entries? Let me check their steps.   In their solution, they first found the projection q of u onto the plane Q, then computed s = 2q - u.   Let me see if that aligns with my approach.   If q is the projection onto the plane, then q = u - proj_n u. So, s = 2q - u = 2(u - proj_n u) - u = 2u - 2 proj_n u - u = u - 2 proj_n u, which is the same as my formula.   So, both approaches should give the same result. Therefore, the user's final matrix should be the same as mine, but it's not. So, perhaps a miscalculation occurred.   Let me compute s as per the user's method.   The user wrote:   [   mathbf{u} - mathbf{q} = frac{mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{n}}{mathbf{n} cdot mathbf{n}} mathbf{n} = frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1  -2  2 end{pmatrix}   ]      Then,   [   mathbf{q} = mathbf{u} - begin{pmatrix} frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9}  frac{-2(a - 2b + 2c)}{9}  frac{2(a - 2b + 2c)}{9} end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} frac{8a + 2b - 2c}{9}  frac{2a + 7b - 4c}{9}  frac{-2a + 4b + 7c}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]      Then, s = 2q - u:   [   mathbf{s} = 2mathbf{q} - mathbf{u} = 2begin{pmatrix} frac{8a + 2b - 2c}{9}  frac{2a + 7b - 4c}{9}  frac{-2a + 4b + 7c}{9} end{pmatrix} - begin{pmatrix} a  b  c end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} frac{7a + 4b - 4c}{9}  frac{4a + 5b - 8c}{9}  frac{-4a + 8b + 5c}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]      So, the reflection matrix S is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{5}{9} & -frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{5}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]      Comparing this with my result:   [   begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]      The first row is the same, but the second and third rows differ in the diagonal and third elements.   Hmm, so where is the discrepancy? Let me check the user's calculation of q.   They wrote:   [   mathbf{q} = mathbf{u} - begin{pmatrix} frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9}  frac{-2(a - 2b + 2c)}{9}  frac{2(a - 2b + 2c)}{9} end{pmatrix}   ]      Let me compute this step by step.   Let me denote t = (a - 2b + 2c)/9.   So,   [   mathbf{q} = begin{pmatrix} a  b  c end{pmatrix} - begin{pmatrix} t  -2t  2t end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} a - t  b + 2t  c - 2t end{pmatrix}   ]      Substituting t:   [   a - t = a - frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9} = frac{9a - a + 2b - 2c}{9} = frac{8a + 2b - 2c}{9}   ]      Similarly,   [   b + 2t = b + 2 times frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9} = b + frac{2a - 4b + 4c}{9} = frac{9b + 2a - 4b + 4c}{9} = frac{2a + 5b + 4c}{9}   ]      Wait, but the user wrote 2a + 7b - 4c. That's different. Did they make a mistake here?   Let me compute again:   [   b + 2t = b + 2 times frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9} = b + frac{2a - 4b + 4c}{9}   ]      To combine terms:   [   = frac{9b + 2a - 4b + 4c}{9} = frac{2a + 5b + 4c}{9}   ]      But the user has 2a + 7b - 4c. That's a discrepancy. So, they must have made a mistake in their calculation.   Similarly, for the third component:   [   c - 2t = c - 2 times frac{a - 2b + 2c}{9} = c - frac{2a - 4b + 4c}{9}   ]      Combining terms:   [   = frac{9c - 2a + 4b - 4c}{9} = frac{-2a + 4b + 5c}{9}   ]      But the user wrote -2a + 4b + 7c. Again, a discrepancy.   So, it seems the user made an error in calculating q. Therefore, their subsequent reflection matrix is incorrect.   So, my initial calculation of the reflection matrix S is correct, resulting in:   [   S = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   But wait, let me verify this with another method to be sure.   Another way to find the reflection matrix is to use the formula:   [   S = I - 2 frac{mathbf{n} mathbf{n}^T}{mathbf{n}^T mathbf{n}}   ]      Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, plugging in the values:   [   S = I - frac{2}{9} begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2  -2 & 4 & -4  2 & -4 & 4 end{pmatrix}   ]      Which gives the same matrix as before.   Therefore, I think my result is correct, and the user's solution had an error in computing the projection q.   To be thorough, let me test both matrices with a sample vector to see which one gives the correct reflection.   Let's choose a vector u that lies on the plane Q. For such a vector, its reflection should be itself.   The plane Q has normal vector n = [1, -2, 2]. So, any vector u on Q satisfies u ‚ãÖ n = 0.   Let me choose u = [2, 1, 0]. Check if it's on Q:   u ‚ãÖ n = 2*1 + 1*(-2) + 0*2 = 2 - 2 + 0 = 0. Yes, it lies on Q.   So, reflecting u through Q should give u itself.   Let's apply both matrices to u.   First, my matrix S:   [   S mathbf{u} = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 end{pmatrix}   ]      Compute each component:   - First component:     (7/9)*2 + (4/9)*1 + (-4/9)*0 = 14/9 + 4/9 + 0 = 18/9 = 2   - Second component:     (4/9)*2 + (1/9)*1 + (8/9)*0 = 8/9 + 1/9 + 0 = 9/9 = 1   - Third component:     (-4/9)*2 + (8/9)*1 + (1/9)*0 = -8/9 + 8/9 + 0 = 0   So, S u = [2, 1, 0] = u. Correct.   Now, the user's matrix:   [   S_{text{user}} = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{5}{9} & -frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{5}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]      Applying to u:   - First component:     (7/9)*2 + (4/9)*1 + (-4/9)*0 = 14/9 + 4/9 = 18/9 = 2   - Second component:     (4/9)*2 + (5/9)*1 + (-8/9)*0 = 8/9 + 5/9 = 13/9 ‚âà 1.444   - Third component:     (-4/9)*2 + (8/9)*1 + (5/9)*0 = -8/9 + 8/9 = 0   So, S_user u = [2, 13/9, 0], which is not equal to u. Therefore, the user's matrix is incorrect.   This confirms that my matrix is correct because it preserves u, which lies on the plane.   Therefore, the correct reflection matrix S is:   [   S = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the second row was [4/9, 1/9, 8/9], and the third row was [-4/9, 8/9, 1/9]. But when I tested with u = [2, 1, 0], it worked correctly.   However, let me test another vector not on the plane to see.   Let me choose u = n = [1, -2, 2]. Reflecting n through the plane Q should invert it because n is perpendicular to Q.   So, reflection of n should be -n.   Let's apply my matrix S to n:   [   S mathbf{n} = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 1  -2  2 end{pmatrix}   ]      Compute each component:   - First component:     (7/9)*1 + (4/9)*(-2) + (-4/9)*2 = 7/9 - 8/9 - 8/9 = (7 - 8 - 8)/9 = (-9)/9 = -1   - Second component:     (4/9)*1 + (1/9)*(-2) + (8/9)*2 = 4/9 - 2/9 + 16/9 = (4 - 2 + 16)/9 = 18/9 = 2   - Third component:     (-4/9)*1 + (8/9)*(-2) + (1/9)*2 = -4/9 - 16/9 + 2/9 = (-4 - 16 + 2)/9 = (-18)/9 = -2   So, S n = [-1, 2, -2] = -n. Correct.   Now, apply the user's matrix to n:   [   S_{text{user}} mathbf{n} = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{5}{9} & -frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{5}{9}   end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 1  -2  2 end{pmatrix}   ]      Compute each component:   - First component:     (7/9)*1 + (4/9)*(-2) + (-4/9)*2 = 7/9 - 8/9 - 8/9 = (-9)/9 = -1   - Second component:     (4/9)*1 + (5/9)*(-2) + (-8/9)*2 = 4/9 - 10/9 - 16/9 = (-22)/9 ‚âà -2.444   - Third component:     (-4/9)*1 + (8/9)*(-2) + (5/9)*2 = -4/9 - 16/9 + 10/9 = (-10)/9 ‚âà -1.111   So, S_user n ‚âà [-1, -2.444, -1.111], which is not equal to -n. Therefore, the user's matrix is incorrect.   This further confirms that my matrix is correct.   Therefore, the correct reflection matrix S is:   [   S = begin{pmatrix}   frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}    frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}    -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9}   end{pmatrix}   ]   Wait, but looking back, in my initial calculation, the second row was [4/9, 1/9, 8/9], but in the user's solution, it was [4/9, 5/9, -8/9]. So, which one is correct?   Let me re-examine the projection matrix P.   P = (1/9) * [1, -2, 2; -2, 4, -4; 2, -4, 4]   So, 2P = (2/9) * [1, -2, 2; -2, 4, -4; 2, -4, 4] = [2/9, -4/9, 4/9; -4/9, 8/9, -8/9; 4/9, -8/9, 8/9]   Then, I - 2P:   First row: 1 - 2/9 = 7/9, 0 - (-4/9) = 4/9, 0 - 4/9 = -4/9   Second row: 0 - (-4/9) = 4/9, 1 - 8/9 = 1/9, 0 - (-8/9) = 8/9   Third row: 0 - 4/9 = -4/9, 0 - (-8/9) = 8/9, 1 - 8/9 = 1/9   So, yes, that's correct.   Therefore, the correct reflection matrix is as I calculated.   However, I notice that in the user's solution, the second and third rows have 5/9 on the diagonal. That suggests they might have made a mistake in the projection step, perhaps adding instead of subtracting.   Alternatively, maybe they used a different formula, such as S = 2Q - I, where Q is the projection onto the plane, but miscalculated Q.   In any case, based on the test with vectors on and perpendicular to the plane, my matrix is correct.   Therefore, the final answer is:   [   boxed{begin{pmatrix} frac{7}{9} & frac{4}{9} & -frac{4}{9}  frac{4}{9} & frac{1}{9} & frac{8}{9}  -frac{4}{9} & frac{8}{9} & frac{1}{9} end{pmatrix}}   ]   Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had a different matrix. Let me check if there's a miscalculation in my part.   Wait, no, my calculation seems consistent. The user's solution had an error in computing q, leading to an incorrect reflection matrix.   Therefore, I will stick with my result."},{"question":"Amy uploaded a total of 4,500 photos to Facebook.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem says ( x^2 = 4 ). Okay, so if I solve for ( x ), that means ( x ) can be either positive or negative 2 because both ( 2^2 ) and ( (-2)^2 ) equal 4. So, ( x = 2 ) or ( x = -2 ). Got that.Next, it says ( |y| = 9 ). Absolute value means the distance from zero, so ( y ) can be either positive or negative 9. So, ( y = 9 ) or ( y = -9 ). That makes sense.Now, the tricky part is the condition ( xy < 0 ). This means that the product of ( x ) and ( y ) is negative. For a product to be negative, one of the numbers has to be positive and the other has to be negative. So, if ( x ) is positive, ( y ) has to be negative, and if ( x ) is negative, ( y ) has to be positive.Let me consider the two cases for ( x ):1. **Case 1: ( x = 2 )**   - Since ( x ) is positive, ( y ) must be negative to satisfy ( xy < 0 ). So, ( y = -9 ).   - Now, I need to find ( x^3 - y ).   - Calculating ( x^3 ): ( 2^3 = 8 ).   - Subtracting ( y ): ( 8 - (-9) = 8 + 9 = 17 ).   - So, in this case, ( x^3 - y = 17 ).2. **Case 2: ( x = -2 )**   - Since ( x ) is negative, ( y ) must be positive to satisfy ( xy < 0 ). So, ( y = 9 ).   - Now, I need to find ( x^3 - y ).   - Calculating ( x^3 ): ( (-2)^3 = -8 ).   - Subtracting ( y ): ( -8 - 9 = -17 ).   - So, in this case, ( x^3 - y = -17 ).Putting it all together, depending on the values of ( x ) and ( y ), ( x^3 - y ) can be either 17 or -17. Therefore, the possible answers are ( pm 17 ).Looking back at the options provided:- A: -17- B: 17- C: ( pm 1 )- D: ( pm 17 )Since both 17 and -17 are possible, the correct answer must include both possibilities. So, option D: ( pm 17 ) is the right choice.I think that's it. I considered both cases for ( x ) and ( y ), checked the condition ( xy < 0 ), and calculated ( x^3 - y ) for each scenario.

Therefore, this becomes 6 divided by 12. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 12 is 0.5. So, option (B) equals 0.5.Next is option (C): 6/(x-2). Since x is 10, x-2 is 8. So, this becomes 6 divided by 8. Calculating that, 6 divided by 8 is 0.75. Therefore, option (C) equals 0.75.Now, option (D): x¬≤/6. With x being 10, x squared is 100. So, this becomes 100 divided by 6. Let me do that division. 100 divided by 6 is approximately 16.666..., which I can round to 16.67 for simplicity. So, option (D) is about 16.67.Lastly, option (E): (x+2)¬≤/6. Plugging in x=10, x+2 is 12, so (12) squared is 144. Therefore, this becomes 144 divided by 6. Calculating that, 144 divided by 6 is 24. So, option (E) equals 24.Now, let me list out all the results:- (A) 0.6- (B) 0.5- (C) 0.75- (D) 16.67- (E) 24Looking at these numbers, I need to find the smallest one. Comparing 0.6, 0.5, 0.75, 16.67, and 24, it's clear that 0.5 is the smallest value among them. So, option (B) is the smallest when x is 10.I think I did everything correctly. I substituted x=10 into each expression, calculated each value step by step, and then compared them. It seems straightforward, but just to double-check, let me verify each calculation quickly.For (A): 6/10 is indeed 0.6.  For (B): 6/12 is 0.5.  For (C): 6/8 is 0.75.  For (D): 100/6 is approximately 16.67.  For (E): 144/6 is exactly 24.Yes, all the calculations check out. So, I'm confident that option (B) is the smallest value when x is 10."},{"question":"Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years, his age will be a multiple of the sum of the ages of his two children. The father's age is 15.

I need to choose from the options: \\"sufficient but not necessary,\\" \\"necessary but not sufficient,\\" \\"necessary and sufficient,\\" or \\"neither sufficient nor necessary.\\" Hmm, let me think about what each of these terms means.First, I remember that a sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement must be true. So, if \\"x > 1\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x > 0,\\" that would mean that whenever x is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 0. That seems to make sense because if x is 2, for example, it's definitely greater than 0. So, \\"x > 1\\" does seem to guarantee \\"x > 0.\\"Now, what about a necessary condition? A necessary condition is one that must be true for the statement to hold, but it doesn't necessarily make the statement true on its own. So, if \\"x > 1\\" were a necessary condition for \\"x > 0,\\" that would mean that for x to be greater than 0, it must also be greater than 1. But wait, that's not true because x could be 0.5, which is greater than 0 but not greater than 1. So, \\"x > 1\\" isn't a necessary condition because you don't have to have x greater than 1 for it to be greater than 0.So putting that together, \\"x > 1\\" is sufficient because it guarantees \\"x > 0,\\" but it's not necessary because \\"x > 0\\" can be true without \\"x > 1\\" being true. Therefore, \\"x > 1\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"x > 0.\\"Wait, let me double-check that. If I say \\"x > 1\\" is sufficient, then whenever x > 1, x > 0 must be true, which is correct. And since there are cases where x > 0 is true without x > 1 being true, it's not necessary. Yeah, that seems right.I don't think it's necessary and sufficient because, as I saw, it's not necessary. And it's definitely not neither because it does provide sufficiency. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident now that \\"sufficient but not necessary\\" is the correct answer."},{"question":"If 5% more is gained by selling an article for a higher price than by selling it for Rs. 340, the cost of the article is Rs. 400.

The difference between the number of each color of marble in the basket that has the greatest difference is 6. How many yellow marbles are in Basket A?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of yellow marbles in Basket A. I'll start by analyzing the differences in the number of marbles of different colors in each basket.In Basket B, there are 6 green marbles and 1 yellow marble. The difference between these two colors is 6 - 1 = 5 marbles.In Basket C, there are 3 white marbles and 9 yellow marbles. The difference here is 9 - 3 = 6 marbles.The problem states that the greatest difference between the number of marbles of any two colors in a basket is 6. Since Basket C already has this greatest difference of 6, Basket A must have a difference less than or equal to 6.Basket A contains 4 red marbles and an unknown number of yellow marbles, which I'll denote as Y. The difference between the number of red and yellow marbles in Basket A is |Y - 4|.To ensure that Basket A does not exceed the greatest difference of 6, I set up the inequality:|Y - 4| ‚â§ 6Solving this inequality:-6 ‚â§ Y - 4 ‚â§ 6Adding 4 to all parts:-2 ‚â§ Y ‚â§ 10Since the number of marbles cannot be negative, Y must be between 0 and 10.

I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's take them one by one.Starting with Statement A: \\"0 is the smallest integer.\\" Hmm, I remember that integers include negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. So, if I think about negative integers like -1, -2, -3, and so on, they are all less than zero. That means zero isn't the smallest integer because there are integers smaller than it. So, Statement A doesn't seem correct.Moving on to Statement B: \\"Rational numbers are either positive or negative.\\" Okay, rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, they include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Wait, zero is also a rational number, and it's neither positive nor negative. So, this statement is missing out on zero. Therefore, Statement B isn't entirely correct either.Next is Statement C: \\"-a is always negative.\\" Alright, so if I have a number 'a', and I put a negative sign in front of it, does that always make it negative? Let's think. If 'a' is positive, like 5, then -5 is negative. But what if 'a' is negative to begin with, say -3? Then -(-3) would be 3, which is positive. So, depending on what 'a' is, -a can be either negative or positive. That means Statement C isn't always true.Finally, Statement D: \\"Integers and fractions are collectively referred to as rational numbers.\\" Okay, so rational numbers are defined as numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, like a/b where b isn't zero. Integers can be written as a/1, so they fit into this definition. Fractions are already in the form a/b. So, combining integers and fractions covers all rational numbers. That makes sense. So, Statement D seems correct.Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Statement A is wrong because there are negative integers smaller than zero. Statement B is wrong because it doesn't account for zero. Statement C is wrong because -a can be positive if 'a' is negative. Statement D is correct because it accurately describes rational numbers as including both integers and fractions.Yeah, I think I've got it right. Statement D is the correct one."},{"question":"There are 5 oak trees currently in the park. Park workers will plant 4 more oak trees today.

I need to find the coordinates of point P. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that the coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants. The second quadrant is where the x-values are negative and the y-values are positive. So, if point P is in the second quadrant, that means x has to be negative, and y has to be positive. Got that down.Next, the problem says that the absolute value of x is 2. Absolute value means the distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. So, |x| = 2 means that x can be either 2 or -2. But since we're in the second quadrant, and x has to be negative, x must be -2. Okay, that makes sense.Now, moving on to y. The problem states that y is the square root of 1. The square root of 1 is 1, right? Because 1 times 1 is 1. But wait, isn't the square root of 1 also -1? Because (-1) times (-1) is also 1. Hmm, so does that mean y could be either 1 or -1?But hold on, since we're in the second quadrant, y has to be positive. So, even though the square root of 1 can technically be both 1 and -1, in this context, y must be positive. Therefore, y is 1. That seems straightforward.Putting it all together, x is -2 and y is 1. So, the coordinates of point P should be (-2, 1). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The second quadrant requires x negative and y positive, which we have. The absolute value of x is 2, which gives us x as -2, and y is the square root of 1, which is 1. Yep, that all checks out.I think I've got it. The coordinates of point P are (-2, 1). I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm pretty confident about this answer."},{"question":"Connie had some marbles. She gave some marbles to Juan and now has 593.0 marbles left.

A sample is drawn from the entire grade using stratified random sampling method according to the gender ratio. If the sample contains 31 male students, then the sample size is ( ).A: 30B: 40C: 50D: 60","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about stratified random sampling in a high school grade. Let me try to understand what it's asking.First, there are 310 male students and 290 female students in the second year. That means the total number of students is 310 plus 290, which is 600 students in total. Got that.Now, they're using stratified random sampling according to the gender ratio. I remember that stratified sampling means dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, and then taking samples from each stratum proportionally. So, in this case, the strata are male and female students.The problem says that the sample contains 31 male students, and we need to find out the total sample size. The options are 30, 40, 50, or 60.Alright, so I need to figure out how the number of male students in the sample relates to the total sample size. Since it's stratified sampling, the proportion of males in the sample should be the same as the proportion of males in the entire grade.Let me calculate the proportion of male students in the entire grade first. There are 310 males out of 600 students. So, the proportion is 310 divided by 600. Let me write that down:Proportion of males = 310 / 600Let me simplify that. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so that becomes 31 / 60. So, the proportion of male students is 31/60.Now, in the sample, there are 31 male students. Let me denote the total sample size as 'n'. Then, the proportion of male students in the sample should also be 31/n, right?Since the sampling is stratified and proportional, these two proportions should be equal. So, I can set up the equation:31 / n = 31 / 60Wait, that seems interesting. Both sides have 31 in the numerator. If I cross-multiply, I get:31 * 60 = 31 * nHmm, that simplifies to 1860 = 31nTo find 'n', I can divide both sides by 31:n = 1860 / 31Let me calculate that. 31 times 60 is 1860, so 1860 divided by 31 is 60.So, n equals 60. That means the total sample size is 60.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the total sample size is 60, and 31 are males, then the number of females should be 60 minus 31, which is 29.Now, let's check the proportions. The proportion of males in the sample is 31/60, which is the same as the proportion in the entire grade, 310/600, which simplifies to 31/60. So, that matches up.Therefore, the sample size should be 60, which is option D.I think that makes sense. The key was recognizing that the proportion of males in the sample should mirror the proportion in the entire population because of the stratified random sampling method."},{"question":"If spending 68 yuan is recorded as -68 yuan, then income 81 yuan is recorded as ( )A: 81 yuanB: 18 yuanC: -81 yuanD: -18 yuan","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how income is recorded based on the given convention for spending.1. **Understanding the Convention**:   - Spending is recorded as a negative value.

Let me try to understand what it's asking. The axiom says, \\"If there are two points on line l that lie on plane Œ±, then line l lies on plane Œ±.\\" I need to translate this statement into set theory terms and choose the correct option from A to D.First, let me recall some basic set theory concepts. In set language, points can be considered as elements, lines and planes as sets. So, if a point is on a line or in a plane, that translates to the point being an element of that set. Similarly, if a line lies on a plane, that means the line is a subset of the plane.Looking at the axiom again: If two points (let's call them A and B) are on line l and also lie on plane Œ±, then the entire line l must lie on plane Œ±. So, in set terms, if A and B are elements of line l and also elements of plane Œ±, then line l is a subset of plane Œ±.Now, let's look at the options:Option A: \\"A ‚äÇ l, B ‚äÇ l and A ‚äÇ Œ±, B ‚äÇ Œ±, then l ‚äÇ Œ±.\\" Hmm, this uses subset notation for points A and B. But points are elements, not subsets. So A and B should be elements of l and Œ±, not subsets. So this might not be correct.Option B: \\"If A ‚àà l, B ‚àà l and A ‚àà Œ±, B ‚àà Œ±, then l ‚àà Œ±.\\" Okay, this uses element notation correctly for points A and B. It says if A and B are in l and also in Œ±, then l is an element of Œ±. Wait, but l is a line, which is a set, so it should be a subset of Œ±, not an element. So this seems incorrect because it uses ‚àà instead of ‚äÇ for l.Option C: \\"If A ‚àà l, B ‚àà l and A ‚àà Œ±, B ‚àà Œ±, then l ‚äÇ Œ±.\\" This looks similar to option B but corrects the last part. It says if A and B are in l and in Œ±, then l is a subset of Œ±. That makes sense because if two points of a line are in a plane, the whole line is in the plane. So this seems correct.Option D: \\"If A ‚àà l, B ‚àà l and A ‚äÇ Œ±, B ‚äÇ Œ±, then l ‚àà Œ±.\\" Here, points A and B are correctly elements of l, but it incorrectly uses subset notation for A and B in Œ±. Also, it concludes that l is an element of Œ±, which is wrong. So this is incorrect.So, going back, option C seems to correctly translate the axiom into set language. It uses ‚àà for points and ‚äÇ for the line being a subset of the plane. The other options either misuse subset notation for points or incorrectly state that the line is an element of the plane instead of a subset.I think I've got it. Option C is the right answer because it accurately represents the relationships using set theory symbols. The points are elements of both the line and the plane, and the line is a subset of the plane.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"If Mukesh got 80% on a test which has a total of 50 marks, how many marks did he get?(A) 40(B) 62.5(C) 10(D) 45(E) 35","answer":"First, I need to determine what 80% of the total marks (50) is.To calculate 80% of 50, I can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing 80 by 100, which gives 0.8.Then, I multiply 0.8 by 50 to find the number of marks Mukesh obtained.0.8 multiplied by 50 equals 40.Therefore, Mukesh scored 40 marks out of 50."},{"question":"A man's speed with the current is 20 kmph and the speed of the current is some kmph.

I know the man's speed with the current is 20 km/h and against the current is 14 km/h.Let‚Äôs denote:- ( m ) as the man's speed in still water,- ( c ) as the speed of the current.When the man is moving with the current, his effective speed is the sum of his speed in still water and the speed of the current:[ m + c = 20 ]When moving against the current, his effective speed is his speed in still water minus the speed of the current:[ m - c = 14 ]Now, I have a system of two equations:1.

And I need to find (x^{-1/3}). Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, especially when they're nested like this. Let me take it step by step.First, I remember that if (log_b a = c), then (a = b^c). So, starting with the outermost logarithm, which is base 5. The equation says (log_5) of something equals 0. That means that something must be equal to (5^0), right? Because (log_b (b^c) = c). So, (5^0 = 1). Therefore, the inside part, which is (log_2 (log_3 x)), must equal 1.So now, I have (log_2 (log_3 x) = 1). Applying the same logic, this means that (log_3 x) must be equal to (2^1), which is 2. So, (log_3 x = 2).Now, solving for (x), since (log_3 x = 2), that means (x = 3^2). Calculating that, (3^2 = 9), so (x = 9).But wait, the question isn't asking for (x); it's asking for (x^{-1/3}). Okay, so I need to compute (9^{-1/3}). Let me recall how negative exponents and fractional exponents work. A negative exponent means reciprocal, and a fractional exponent like (1/3) means the cube root. So, (9^{-1/3}) is the same as (1/(9^{1/3})).Now, (9^{1/3}) is the cube root of 9. I know that 9 is (3^2), so (9^{1/3} = (3^2)^{1/3} = 3^{2/3}). But I don't think that simplifies much further. So, (9^{-1/3} = 1/(3^{2/3})), which is the same as (1/sqrt[3]{9}).Looking back at the options, option B is (frac{1}{sqrt[3]{9}}), which matches what I got. So, I think that's the answer.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the outermost logarithm: (log_5) of something is 0, so that something is 1. Then, (log_2) of something is 1, so that something is 2. Then, (log_3 x = 2), so (x = 9). Then, (x^{-1/3}) is (9^{-1/3}), which is (1/sqrt[3]{9}). Yep, that seems right.I don't think I made any calculation errors. Each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that option B is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"A sequence ( i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{n} ) is formed from the first ( n > 3 ) natural numbers, arranged in random order. What is the probability that for all ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ), the inequality ( i_{k} geq k - 3 ) holds true?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the probability that for a sequence formed by the first n natural numbers arranged randomly, each element in the sequence satisfies the inequality i_k ‚â• k - 3 for all k from 1 to n. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what the problem is asking. We have a permutation of the numbers 1 through n, and we want to know the probability that for every position k in this permutation, the number at that position is at least k - 3. So, for example, at position 1, the number should be at least 1 - 3, which is -2. But since all our numbers are positive, this condition is automatically satisfied for k = 1. Similarly, for k = 2, the number should be at least 2 - 3 = -1, which is also automatically satisfied because all numbers are positive. For k = 3, the number should be at least 0, which again is always true. So, the real constraints start from k = 4 onwards, right?Wait, let me verify that. For k = 4, the inequality becomes i_4 ‚â• 4 - 3 = 1. So, the number at position 4 has to be at least 1. But since all numbers are at least 1, this is also automatically satisfied. Hmm, maybe I need to check k = 5. For k = 5, the inequality is i_5 ‚â• 5 - 3 = 2. So, the number at position 5 has to be at least 2. That's a meaningful constraint because it excludes the number 1 from being in position 5.Similarly, for k = 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so the number at position 6 has to be at least 3. So, numbers 1 and 2 are excluded from position 6. Continuing this way, for k = 7, i_7 ‚â• 4, so numbers 1, 2, 3 are excluded, and so on. Wait, but when k increases beyond n, does this make sense? No, because n is the total number of elements, so k goes up to n. So, for k = n, the inequality is i_n ‚â• n - 3. So, the number at position n has to be at least n - 3. That means the number can be n - 3, n - 2, n - 1, or n. So, only four possible numbers can be at position n.Similarly, for k = n - 1, the inequality is i_{n-1} ‚â• (n - 1) - 3 = n - 4. So, the number at position n - 1 has to be at least n - 4. So, the possible numbers are n - 4, n - 3, n - 2, n - 1, n. But wait, n is already a possible number for position n, so if we're considering permutations, n can only be in one position. So, if n is in position n, then n - 1 can be in position n - 1 or somewhere else.Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about this as a permutation problem with certain restrictions. Each position k has a minimum value that the number can take. So, for k = 1, 2, 3, the minimum is 1, 2, 3 respectively, but since the numbers are positive, these are automatically satisfied. Starting from k = 4, the minimum value is k - 3, which is 1, 2, 3, etc., but actually, for k = 4, it's 1, which is already satisfied because all numbers are at least 1. Wait, no, for k = 4, it's i_4 ‚â• 1, which is always true. For k = 5, i_5 ‚â• 2, which means 1 cannot be in position 5. For k = 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so 1 and 2 cannot be in position 6. For k = 7, i_7 ‚â• 4, so 1, 2, 3 cannot be in position 7, and so on.So, the constraints are that for each position k ‚â• 4, the number at that position must be at least k - 3. So, the first three positions (k = 1, 2, 3) have no restrictions beyond the numbers being positive, which they already are. The rest of the positions have restrictions on which numbers can be placed there.Now, to find the probability, I need to find the number of valid permutations that satisfy all these inequalities and divide it by the total number of permutations, which is n!.So, the problem reduces to counting the number of permutations where for each k from 4 to n, the number at position k is at least k - 3.This seems similar to derangement problems or permutation with restricted positions, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I can model this as a permutation where certain elements cannot be in certain positions.Let me think about the constraints more carefully. For each position k, starting from k = 4, the number i_k must be ‚â• k - 3. So, for position 4, i_4 ‚â• 1, which is always true. For position 5, i_5 ‚â• 2, so 1 cannot be in position 5. For position 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so 1 and 2 cannot be in position 6. For position 7, i_7 ‚â• 4, so 1, 2, 3 cannot be in position 7, and so on.Wait, so for position k, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, ..., (k - 4). Because i_k ‚â• k - 3 implies that numbers less than k - 3 are forbidden. So, for position k, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, ..., (k - 4). For example, for k = 5, forbidden numbers are 1 (since 5 - 4 = 1). For k = 6, forbidden numbers are 1, 2 (since 6 - 4 = 2). For k = 7, forbidden numbers are 1, 2, 3 (since 7 - 4 = 3). And so on.So, in general, for each position k, the number of forbidden numbers is (k - 4). But wait, for k = 4, forbidden numbers would be 0, which makes sense because there are no forbidden numbers for k = 4.So, the problem is similar to arranging n elements where each position k (from 4 to n) has (k - 4) forbidden numbers. The first three positions have no forbidden numbers.This seems like a problem that can be approached using inclusion-exclusion principles, but inclusion-exclusion can get complicated for large n. Maybe there's a pattern or a recursive way to approach this.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a permutation where certain elements must be placed in certain positions. For example, the numbers 1, 2, 3 must be placed in the first three positions because starting from position 4, they are forbidden.Wait, let's think about that. If numbers 1, 2, 3 are forbidden from positions 4 to n, then they must be placed in positions 1, 2, 3. So, the numbers 1, 2, 3 can only be in the first three positions. The rest of the numbers (4 to n) can be placed anywhere, but with some restrictions.Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because for position 4, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, 3, but for position 5, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, and so on. So, actually, numbers 1, 2, 3 are forbidden from positions 4 and beyond, but they can be placed in positions 1, 2, 3. Similarly, number 4 is forbidden from position 7 and beyond, but allowed in positions 1 through 6, and so on.Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider the numbers 1, 2, 3. They cannot be placed in positions 4 to n. So, they must be placed in positions 1, 2, 3. Similarly, number 4 cannot be placed in positions 7 to n, so it can be placed in positions 1 to 6. Number 5 cannot be placed in positions 8 to n, so it can be placed in positions 1 to 7, and so on.Wait, so each number m can be placed in positions 1 to (m + 3). Because for number m, the forbidden positions are k where k - 3 > m, which implies k > m + 3. So, number m can be placed in positions 1 to m + 3.But since the total number of positions is n, for m such that m + 3 ‚â• n, the number m can be placed anywhere. For example, if m = n - 3, then m + 3 = n, so number m can be placed in positions 1 to n. Similarly, for m = n - 2, m + 3 = n + 1, which is beyond n, so number m can be placed anywhere.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to rephrase.Each number m has a set of allowed positions. For number m, the allowed positions are k such that k - 3 ‚â§ m, which implies k ‚â§ m + 3. So, number m can be placed in positions 1 to m + 3. However, since the total number of positions is n, the allowed positions for m are 1 to min(m + 3, n).So, for m = 1, allowed positions are 1 to 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4). For m = 2, allowed positions are 1 to 5. For m = 3, allowed positions are 1 to 6. For m = 4, allowed positions are 1 to 7, and so on, up to m = n, which can be placed anywhere.Wait, but for m = n, allowed positions are 1 to n + 3, but since n is the total number of positions, it's just 1 to n. So, number n can be placed anywhere.Similarly, for m = n - 1, allowed positions are 1 to (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2, which is beyond n, so allowed positions are 1 to n.So, in general, numbers m where m + 3 ‚â• n can be placed anywhere. For m < n - 3, the allowed positions are limited to 1 to m + 3.This seems like a problem of counting the number of injective functions (permutations) where each element m is mapped to a position k ‚â§ m + 3.This is similar to a permutation with specific position constraints, often referred to as a permutation with forbidden positions or a derangement problem with specific restrictions.I recall that such problems can sometimes be approached using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by constructing a recurrence relation.Let me try to model this as a permutation where each number m has a certain number of allowed positions, and we need to count the number of such permutations.For each number m, the number of allowed positions is:- For m = 1: 4 positions (1 to 4)- For m = 2: 5 positions (1 to 5)- For m = 3: 6 positions (1 to 6)- For m = 4: 7 positions (1 to 7)- ...- For m = n - 3: n positions (1 to n)- For m = n - 2: n positions (1 to n)- For m = n - 1: n positions (1 to n)- For m = n: n positions (1 to n)Wait, but this seems a bit off because for m = 1, allowed positions are 1 to 4, but in reality, for m = 1, the allowed positions are 1 to 4 because i_k ‚â• k - 3 implies that for k = 4, i_4 ‚â• 1, so 1 can be in position 4. Similarly, for k = 5, i_5 ‚â• 2, so 1 cannot be in position 5. So, 1 can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.Similarly, for m = 2, allowed positions are 1 to 5 because for k = 5, i_5 ‚â• 2, so 2 can be in position 5. For k = 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so 2 cannot be in position 6. So, 2 can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.Similarly, for m = 3, allowed positions are 1 to 6 because for k = 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so 3 can be in position 6. For k = 7, i_7 ‚â• 4, so 3 cannot be in position 7. So, 3 can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.Continuing this way, for m = 4, allowed positions are 1 to 7, and so on.So, in general, for each m, the number of allowed positions is m + 3, but not exceeding n.Therefore, for m ‚â§ n - 3, the number of allowed positions is m + 3. For m > n - 3, the number of allowed positions is n.So, the problem is to count the number of injective mappings (permutations) where each m is mapped to a position ‚â§ m + 3, with the understanding that for m > n - 3, the upper limit is n.This seems like a problem that can be approached using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or recursion.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a permutation where certain elements have limited choices, and the rest can be placed freely.Wait, let me think about the first few numbers. Numbers 1, 2, 3 have limited allowed positions:- 1 can be in positions 1-4- 2 can be in positions 1-5- 3 can be in positions 1-6Numbers 4 and above can be placed in more positions, up to their m + 3.But since we're dealing with permutations, once a number is placed in a position, that position is no longer available for other numbers.This seems complex, but maybe we can break it down.Let me consider the total number of permutations where each number m is placed in a position ‚â§ m + 3.This is similar to counting the number of injective functions f: {1, 2, ..., n} ‚Üí {1, 2, ..., n} such that f(m) ‚â§ m + 3 for all m.I think this is a known problem in combinatorics, sometimes referred to as the number of permutations with bounded displacement or the number of permutations where each element is not moved too far from its original position.In our case, each element m can be moved to the right by at most 3 positions, but it can be moved to the left any number of positions. Wait, no, actually, the constraint is that f(m) ‚â§ m + 3, which means that each element can be moved to the right by at most 3 positions, but there's no restriction on moving to the left.Wait, actually, f(m) ‚â§ m + 3 means that the position of m can be at most 3 positions to the right of its original position. But since we're dealing with permutations, the original position is m, so f(m) can be from 1 to m + 3.But in our problem, the original position is not fixed; we're just permuting the numbers. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as each number m can be placed in any position up to m + 3.This is similar to the problem of counting the number of permutations where each element is mapped to a position within a certain range.I think this can be approached using recursion. Let me define a function P(n) as the number of valid permutations of n elements satisfying the given condition.To find a recurrence relation for P(n), let's consider where the number n can be placed. Since n can be placed in any position from 1 to n, but in our case, n can be placed in any position because for m = n, the allowed positions are 1 to n + 3, which is beyond n, so n can be placed anywhere.Wait, but actually, for m = n, the allowed positions are 1 to n, so n can be placed anywhere. Similarly, for m = n - 1, allowed positions are 1 to n + 2, which is beyond n, so n - 1 can be placed anywhere.Wait, no, for m = n - 1, allowed positions are 1 to (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2, which is beyond n, so n - 1 can be placed in any position from 1 to n.Similarly, for m = n - 2, allowed positions are 1 to (n - 2) + 3 = n + 1, which is beyond n, so n - 2 can be placed anywhere.Wait, so actually, for m ‚â• n - 3, the allowed positions are 1 to n, so they can be placed anywhere. Only for m ‚â§ n - 4, the allowed positions are limited to 1 to m + 3.Therefore, the constraint is only on the first n - 3 numbers. The last 3 numbers (n - 2, n - 1, n) can be placed anywhere.So, perhaps we can model this as follows:We have n positions. The last 3 numbers (n - 2, n - 1, n) can be placed in any of the n positions. The first n - 3 numbers (1 to n - 3) have constraints on where they can be placed.But since it's a permutation, once we place some numbers, the remaining numbers have fewer positions to choose from.This seems complicated, but maybe we can think of it as arranging the first n - 3 numbers with constraints and then arranging the last 3 numbers freely.Wait, but the last 3 numbers can be placed anywhere, including the first n - 3 positions, which complicates things because their placement affects the available positions for the first n - 3 numbers.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the problem as arranging all n numbers with the constraints on the first n - 3 numbers.Let me try to think recursively. Suppose I have P(n) as the number of valid permutations for n elements. To build P(n), I can consider where the number n is placed. Since n can be placed in any position from 1 to n, let's say we place n in position k. Then, the remaining n - 1 numbers need to be arranged in the remaining n - 1 positions, but with the constraints adjusted accordingly.However, placing n in position k affects the constraints for the remaining numbers. Specifically, for the remaining numbers, their allowed positions are still based on their own m values, but position k is now occupied by n, so it's no longer available.But since n can be placed anywhere, and the constraints for the other numbers are independent of where n is placed, maybe the recurrence isn't straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a permutation where the first n - 3 numbers have limited choices, and the last 3 can be placed anywhere.Wait, let's think about the first n - 3 numbers. Each of these numbers m (from 1 to n - 3) can be placed in positions 1 to m + 3. The last 3 numbers (n - 2, n - 1, n) can be placed anywhere.So, perhaps we can first arrange the first n - 3 numbers with their constraints, and then arrange the last 3 numbers in the remaining positions.But the problem is that the last 3 numbers can be placed in any positions, including those already considered by the first n - 3 numbers. So, it's not a simple multiplication of two independent arrangements.Alternatively, maybe we can consider the entire permutation as a combination of arranging the first n - 3 numbers with constraints and then arranging the last 3 numbers in the remaining positions, but this seems tricky because the constraints on the first n - 3 numbers are dependent on the positions chosen by the last 3 numbers.Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the problem as a permutation where each element m has a certain number of available positions, and we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid permutations.The principle of inclusion-exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations avoiding certain forbidden positions. In our case, each number m has some forbidden positions (positions k where k > m + 3). So, the total number of valid permutations is the inclusion-exclusion sum over all subsets of forbidden positions.However, inclusion-exclusion can get very complicated for large n, as the number of terms grows exponentially. So, maybe this isn't the most efficient approach.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a derangement problem with specific constraints. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.Wait, another idea: since the constraints are that each number m can be placed in positions 1 to m + 3, maybe we can think of this as a permutation where each number is not too far to the right of its original position. This is similar to the concept of a \\"bounded permutation\\" or \\"permutation with limited displacement.\\"I recall that such problems can sometimes be solved using generating functions or recursive relations.Let me try to define a recurrence relation. Let P(n) be the number of valid permutations of n elements. To find P(n), we can consider where the number n is placed. Since n can be placed in any position from 1 to n, let's say we place n in position k. Then, the remaining n - 1 numbers need to be arranged in the remaining n - 1 positions, but with the constraints adjusted accordingly.However, placing n in position k affects the constraints for the remaining numbers. Specifically, for the remaining numbers, their allowed positions are still based on their own m values, but position k is now occupied by n, so it's no longer available.But since n can be placed anywhere, and the constraints for the other numbers are independent of where n is placed, maybe the recurrence isn't straightforward.Wait, perhaps instead of considering where n is placed, we can consider the first position and see which numbers can be placed there.For position 1, any number can be placed there because the constraint is i_1 ‚â• 1 - 3 = -2, which is always true. So, position 1 can be filled by any of the n numbers.Similarly, position 2 can be filled by any number because i_2 ‚â• 2 - 3 = -1, which is also always true.Position 3 can be filled by any number because i_3 ‚â• 3 - 3 = 0, which is always true.Starting from position 4, the constraints kick in. For position 4, i_4 ‚â• 1, which is always true, so position 4 can be filled by any number. Wait, but earlier I thought that for position 4, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, 3, but now I'm confused.Wait, let me clarify. For position k, the constraint is i_k ‚â• k - 3. So, for k = 4, i_4 ‚â• 1, which means that numbers less than 1 are forbidden, but since all numbers are at least 1, this is automatically satisfied. So, position 4 can be filled by any number.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought that for position k, forbidden numbers are 1, 2, ..., (k - 4). Maybe I made a mistake there.Let me re-examine the constraint. For position k, i_k ‚â• k - 3. So, the forbidden numbers are those less than k - 3. So, for k = 4, forbidden numbers are less than 1, which are none, so position 4 can be filled by any number.For k = 5, forbidden numbers are less than 2, which is only number 1. So, position 5 cannot have number 1.For k = 6, forbidden numbers are less than 3, which are numbers 1 and 2. So, position 6 cannot have numbers 1 or 2.For k = 7, forbidden numbers are less than 4, which are numbers 1, 2, 3. So, position 7 cannot have numbers 1, 2, or 3.And so on, up to k = n, where forbidden numbers are less than n - 3, which are numbers 1, 2, ..., n - 4.Wait, so for each position k, the forbidden numbers are 1, 2, ..., (k - 4). So, for k = 4, forbidden numbers are 1, 2, ..., 0, which is none. For k = 5, forbidden numbers are 1. For k = 6, forbidden numbers are 1, 2. For k = 7, forbidden numbers are 1, 2, 3, and so on.So, the number of forbidden numbers for position k is (k - 4). For k < 4, there are no forbidden numbers.Therefore, the problem is that for each position k ‚â• 4, the number at that position cannot be among the first (k - 4) numbers.This is similar to a permutation where certain positions have forbidden elements, and we need to count the number of derangements with these specific forbidden positions.This seems like a problem that can be approached using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) is given by n! times the sum_{i=0 to n} (-1)^i / i!}. But in our case, the forbidden positions are more complex.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a permutation matrix where certain positions are forbidden, and we need to count the number of permutation matrices avoiding those positions.But I'm not sure about the exact formula for this. Maybe I can look for a pattern by computing the number of valid permutations for small n and see if I can find a recurrence relation.Let's try n = 4. For n = 4, the constraints are:- For k = 1, 2, 3: no constraints.- For k = 4: i_4 ‚â• 1, which is always true.So, all permutations of 4 elements are valid. Therefore, P(4) = 4! = 24.Wait, but according to the problem statement, n > 3, so n = 4 is allowed.Wait, but let me check. For n = 4, the constraints are:- i_1 ‚â• -2 (always true)- i_2 ‚â• -1 (always true)- i_3 ‚â• 0 (always true)- i_4 ‚â• 1 (always true)So, indeed, all permutations are valid. So, P(4) = 24.Now, n = 5. For n = 5, the constraints are:- For k = 1, 2, 3: no constraints.- For k = 4: i_4 ‚â• 1 (always true)- For k = 5: i_5 ‚â• 2, so number 1 cannot be in position 5.So, we need to count the number of permutations of 5 elements where number 1 is not in position 5.The total number of permutations is 5! = 120.The number of permutations where 1 is in position 5 is 4! = 24.Therefore, the number of valid permutations is 120 - 24 = 96.So, P(5) = 96.Similarly, for n = 6, the constraints are:- For k = 1, 2, 3: no constraints.- For k = 4: i_4 ‚â• 1 (always true)- For k = 5: i_5 ‚â• 2 (number 1 cannot be in position 5)- For k = 6: i_6 ‚â• 3 (numbers 1 and 2 cannot be in position 6)So, we need to count the number of permutations of 6 elements where:- Number 1 is not in position 5 or 6.- Number 2 is not in position 6.Wait, actually, for k = 6, i_6 ‚â• 3, so numbers 1 and 2 cannot be in position 6. So, both 1 and 2 are forbidden in position 6.Similarly, for k = 5, i_5 ‚â• 2, so number 1 is forbidden in position 5.So, the forbidden assignments are:- Position 5 cannot have number 1.- Position 6 cannot have numbers 1 or 2.So, to count the number of valid permutations, we can use inclusion-exclusion.Total permutations: 6! = 720.Subtract the permutations where 1 is in position 5 or 6, and 2 is in position 6.But we have to be careful with overlapping cases.Let me define:A: permutations where 1 is in position 5.B: permutations where 1 is in position 6.C: permutations where 2 is in position 6.We need to compute |A ‚à™ B ‚à™ C| and subtract it from the total.But actually, since 2 is only forbidden in position 6, and 1 is forbidden in positions 5 and 6, the forbidden permutations are those where 1 is in 5 or 6, or 2 is in 6.So, |A ‚à™ B ‚à™ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ‚à© B| - |A ‚à© C| - |B ‚à© C| + |A ‚à© B ‚à© C|.Compute each term:|A|: Number of permutations with 1 in position 5: 5! = 120.|B|: Number of permutations with 1 in position 6: 5! = 120.|C|: Number of permutations with 2 in position 6: 5! = 120.|A ‚à© B|: Impossible, since 1 cannot be in both position 5 and 6. So, |A ‚à© B| = 0.|A ‚à© C|: Number of permutations with 1 in position 5 and 2 in position 6: 4! = 24.|B ‚à© C|: Number of permutations with 1 in position 6 and 2 in position 6: Impossible, since 1 and 2 cannot both be in position 6. So, |B ‚à© C| = 0.|A ‚à© B ‚à© C|: Impossible, as above. So, |A ‚à© B ‚à© C| = 0.Therefore, |A ‚à™ B ‚à™ C| = 120 + 120 + 120 - 0 - 24 - 0 + 0 = 336.Therefore, the number of valid permutations is 720 - 336 = 384.So, P(6) = 384.Similarly, for n = 7, the constraints are:- For k = 1, 2, 3: no constraints.- For k = 4: i_4 ‚â• 1 (always true)- For k = 5: i_5 ‚â• 2 (number 1 cannot be in position 5)- For k = 6: i_6 ‚â• 3 (numbers 1 and 2 cannot be in position 6)- For k = 7: i_7 ‚â• 4 (numbers 1, 2, 3 cannot be in position 7)So, the forbidden assignments are:- Position 5: 1- Position 6: 1, 2- Position 7: 1, 2, 3This is getting more complex. Let me try to compute P(7) using inclusion-exclusion.Total permutations: 7! = 5040.Forbidden assignments:- Position 5: 1- Position 6: 1, 2- Position 7: 1, 2, 3So, we need to subtract permutations where:- 1 is in position 5- 1 is in position 6- 2 is in position 6- 1 is in position 7- 2 is in position 7- 3 is in position 7But we also have to account for overlaps where multiple forbidden assignments occur.This is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a pattern emerging from P(4) = 24, P(5) = 96, P(6) = 384.Looking at these numbers:P(4) = 24 = 4!P(5) = 96 = 4! * 4P(6) = 384 = 4! * 16Wait, 4! is 24, 24 * 4 = 96, 96 * 4 = 384. So, it seems like P(n) = P(n - 1) * 4 for n ‚â• 5.But let's check:P(4) = 24P(5) = 24 * 4 = 96P(6) = 96 * 4 = 384If this pattern continues, P(7) = 384 * 4 = 1536But let's verify this by computing P(7) manually.For n = 7, the forbidden assignments are:- Position 5: 1- Position 6: 1, 2- Position 7: 1, 2, 3So, we need to count the number of permutations where:- 1 is not in positions 5, 6, 7- 2 is not in positions 6, 7- 3 is not in position 7This is a more complex inclusion-exclusion problem. Let me try to compute it.Total permutations: 7! = 5040.Define the forbidden sets:A1: permutations where 1 is in position 5A2: permutations where 1 is in position 6A3: permutations where 1 is in position 7A4: permutations where 2 is in position 6A5: permutations where 2 is in position 7A6: permutations where 3 is in position 7We need to compute |A1 ‚à™ A2 ‚à™ A3 ‚à™ A4 ‚à™ A5 ‚à™ A6| and subtract it from 5040.This is going to be quite involved, but let's proceed step by step.First, compute the individual |Ai|:|A1| = 6! = 720 (fix 1 in position 5)|A2| = 6! = 720 (fix 1 in position 6)|A3| = 6! = 720 (fix 1 in position 7)|A4| = 6! = 720 (fix 2 in position 6)|A5| = 6! = 720 (fix 2 in position 7)|A6| = 6! = 720 (fix 3 in position 7)Now, compute the pairwise intersections:|A1 ‚à© A2| = 0 (1 cannot be in both 5 and 6)|A1 ‚à© A3| = 0 (1 cannot be in both 5 and 7)|A1 ‚à© A4| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 5 and 2 in 6)|A1 ‚à© A5| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 5 and 2 in 7)|A1 ‚à© A6| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 5 and 3 in 7)|A2 ‚à© A3| = 0 (1 cannot be in both 6 and 7)|A2 ‚à© A4| = 0 (1 in 6 and 2 in 6 is impossible)|A2 ‚à© A5| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 6 and 2 in 7)|A2 ‚à© A6| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 6 and 3 in 7)|A3 ‚à© A4| = 5! = 120 (fix 1 in 7 and 2 in 6)|A3 ‚à© A5| = 0 (2 cannot be in both 7 and 7)|A3 ‚à© A6| = 0 (1 in 7 and 3 in 7 is impossible)|A4 ‚à© A5| = 5! = 120 (fix 2 in 6 and 2 in 7 is impossible, so 0)Wait, no, fixing 2 in 6 and 2 in 7 is impossible, so |A4 ‚à© A5| = 0Similarly, |A4 ‚à© A6| = 5! = 120 (fix 2 in 6 and 3 in 7)|A5 ‚à© A6| = 5! = 120 (fix 2 in 7 and 3 in 7 is impossible, so 0)Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid permutations follows the pattern P(n) = 4 * P(n - 1). From P(4) = 24, P(5) = 96, P(6) = 384, so P(7) would be 1536.But let's see if this makes sense. If P(n) = 4 * P(n - 1), then for each additional n, we multiply by 4. This suggests that for each new position, there are 4 choices, which might correspond to the last few positions having 4 choices each.But I'm not sure if this pattern holds for all n. Let me check for n = 7.If P(7) = 1536, then the probability would be 1536 / 5040 ‚âà 0.3048.But let me try to compute P(7) more carefully.Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid permutations is 4^{n - 3} * 3!.Wait, for n = 4, 4^{1} * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24, which matches P(4).For n = 5, 4^{2} * 6 = 16 * 6 = 96, which matches P(5).For n = 6, 4^{3} * 6 = 64 * 6 = 384, which matches P(6).So, perhaps the general formula is P(n) = 4^{n - 3} * 6.Therefore, the probability would be P(n) / n! = (4^{n - 3} * 6) / n!.So, the probability is 6 * 4^{n - 3} / n!.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{dfrac{6 cdot 4^{n-3}}{n!}}."},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)3-4+2;<br/>(2)-2.5√∑frac{5}{16}√ó(-frac{1}{8});<br/>(3)(-2)^2-|-6|+sqrt{4}+(-1)^{2023};<br/>(4)[-5^{2}√ó(-frac{1}{5})^{2}-0.8]√∑(-2frac{2}{5}).","answer":"Okay, so I've got these four math problems to solve. Let me take them one by one and think through each step carefully. I want to make sure I understand what's being asked and how to approach each problem correctly.Starting with the first one: (1) 3 - 4 + 2. Hmm, this looks straightforward, but I remember that the order of operations is important, even with just addition and subtraction. I think I should go from left to right. So, 3 minus 4 is -1, and then -1 plus 2 should be 1. That seems simple enough.Moving on to the second problem: (2) -2.5 √∑ (5/16) √ó (-1/8). Okay, this involves division and multiplication with fractions and negative numbers. I need to be careful with the signs here. First, I'll convert -2.5 into a fraction to make it easier to work with. -2.5 is the same as -5/2. So now, the expression becomes (-5/2) √∑ (5/16) √ó (-1/8). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so (-5/2) √ó (16/5). Let's compute that: (-5/2) √ó (16/5) equals (-5 √ó 16) / (2 √ó 5), which simplifies to (-80)/10, which is -8. Now, multiply that by (-1/8): -8 √ó (-1/8) equals 1. So, the result is positive 1.Alright, that wasn't too bad. On to the third problem: (3) (-2)^2 - |-6| + sqrt(4) + (-1)^2023. This one has exponents, absolute value, square roots, and a negative exponent. Let's break it down term by term. First, (-2)^2 is 4 because when you square a negative number, the result is positive. Next, the absolute value of -6 is 6. Then, the square root of 4 is 2. Finally, (-1) raised to the 2023rd power. Since 2023 is an odd number, this will be -1. Now, putting it all together: 4 - 6 + 2 - 1. Let's compute that step by step. 4 minus 6 is -2, plus 2 is 0, minus 1 is -1. So, the result is -1.Now, the fourth problem: (4) [-5^2 √ó (-1/5)^2 - 0.8] √∑ (-2 2/5). This looks a bit more complex with exponents, fractions, and mixed numbers. Let me parse this carefully. First, inside the brackets: -5^2. Wait, is that (-5)^2 or -(5^2)? I think it's -(5^2) because the exponent applies only to 5, not the negative sign. So, 5 squared is 25, and the negative makes it -25. Next, (-1/5)^2 is (1/5)^2 because the negative is inside the parentheses, so that's 1/25. Now, multiplying these two results: -25 √ó (1/25) equals -1. Then, subtract 0.8: -1 - 0.8 equals -1.8. Now, we have to divide this by (-2 2/5). First, let's convert the mixed number to an improper fraction. -2 2/5 is the same as -12/5. So, now, we have -1.8 √∑ (-12/5). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so -1.8 √ó (-5/12). Let's compute that. First, multiply the numerators: 1.8 √ó 5 equals 9. Then, the denominators: 1 √ó 12 equals 12. So, 9/12 simplifies to 3/4, which is 0.75. Since both numbers are negative, the result is positive. So, the final answer is 0.75.Wait, let me double-check that last step. I had -1.8 divided by -12/5. Converting -1.8 to a fraction, that's -9/5. So, -9/5 divided by -12/5 is the same as (-9/5) √ó (-5/12). The 5s cancel out, and we're left with (9/12), which simplifies to 3/4 or 0.75. Yep, that checks out.So, to summarize:1. 3 - 4 + 2 = 12. -2.5 √∑ (5/16) √ó (-1/8) = 13. (-2)^2 - |-6| + sqrt(4) + (-1)^2023 = -14. [-5^2 √ó (-1/5)^2 - 0.8] √∑ (-2 2/5) = 0.75I think I've got all of them right. It's important to be careful with the order of operations and the signs, especially when dealing with negative numbers and exponents. Taking it step by step and verifying each part helps ensure accuracy."},{"question":"A coach placed 15 tennis balls and a certain number of soccer balls each into 5 baskets. He gave 5 of his students a short period of time to remove as many balls each from a basket as they could. 3 of them removed 8 balls each and the other 2 removed 10 balls each. If a total of 56 balls are still in the baskets, how many soccer balls did the coach place in each basket initially?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of balls removed by the students. Three students removed 8 balls each, which totals 24 balls. The other two students removed 10 balls each, totaling 20 balls. Adding these together, the students removed 44 balls in total.Next, I'll calculate the initial number of balls in the baskets. If there are 56 balls remaining after the students removed 44 balls, the initial total number of balls was 56 plus 44, which equals 100 balls.Knowing that there were 15 tennis balls in each of the 5 baskets, there were a total of 75 tennis balls. Subtracting the number of tennis balls from the total gives the number of soccer balls: 100 minus 75 equals 25 soccer balls.Finally, since there are 5 baskets, I'll divide the total number of soccer balls by the number of baskets to find out how many soccer balls were in each basket initially: 25 divided by 5 equals 5 soccer balls per basket."},{"question":"Sammy has 9 math problems to do for homework.

Each week has 7 days, and there are 3 additional days, making a total of 31 days.Finally, to find the average temperature, I'll divide the total temperature by the number of days: 2063¬∞F divided by 31 days equals approximately 66.55¬∞F."},{"question":"Convert the base-5 number 98_{(5)} to a base-9 number.","answer":"First, I need to convert the base-5 number (98_{(5)}) to its decimal (base-10) equivalent.

She spent 20% in February and 40% in March, which adds up to 60% of her savings.Next, I calculate the remaining percentage of her savings after these expenses. Since 100% represents her total savings, subtracting the 60% spent leaves her with 40% of her savings.In April, Reese spent 1,500 and still had 2,900 left in her account. This means that the 2,900 plus the 1,500 spent in April equals 4,400, which represents the 40% of her savings that was left after February and March expenses.To find the value of 1% of her savings, I divide 4,400 by 40, which equals 110.

The integral is from 3/4 to 4/3 of (2x¬≤ + x + 1)/(x¬≥ + x¬≤ + x + 1) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.First, I remember that when dealing with integrals of rational functions, partial fraction decomposition is often useful. So, let me try to factor the denominator to see if I can break this down into simpler fractions.The denominator is x¬≥ + x¬≤ + x + 1. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe I can factor by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:x¬≥ + x¬≤ + x + 1 = x¬≤(x + 1) + 1(x + 1) = (x¬≤ + 1)(x + 1). Oh, nice! So the denominator factors into (x + 1)(x¬≤ + 1). That should help with the partial fractions.Now, I can write the integrand as (2x¬≤ + x + 1)/[(x + 1)(x¬≤ + 1)]. Let's set this equal to A/(x + 1) + (Bx + C)/(x¬≤ + 1), where A, B, and C are constants to be determined.So, (2x¬≤ + x + 1) = A(x¬≤ + 1) + (Bx + C)(x + 1). Let's expand the right side:A(x¬≤ + 1) + (Bx + C)(x + 1) = A x¬≤ + A + Bx¬≤ + Bx + Cx + C.Combine like terms:(A + B)x¬≤ + (B + C)x + (A + C).Now, set this equal to the left side, which is 2x¬≤ + x + 1. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:1. A + B = 2 (coefficient of x¬≤)2. B + C = 1 (coefficient of x)3. A + C = 1 (constant term)Let me solve this system. From equation 3: A + C = 1. From equation 2: B + C = 1. So, both A + C and B + C equal 1. That suggests that A = B.From equation 1: A + B = 2. Since A = B, then 2A = 2, so A = 1. Therefore, B = 1.Now, from equation 3: A + C = 1, so 1 + C = 1, which means C = 0.So, the partial fractions decomposition is:(2x¬≤ + x + 1)/[(x + 1)(x¬≤ + 1)] = 1/(x + 1) + (1x + 0)/(x¬≤ + 1) = 1/(x + 1) + x/(x¬≤ + 1).Great, now the integral becomes:‚à´ [1/(x + 1) + x/(x¬≤ + 1)] dx from 3/4 to 4/3.Let me split this into two separate integrals:‚à´ 1/(x + 1) dx + ‚à´ x/(x¬≤ + 1) dx.The first integral is straightforward. The integral of 1/(x + 1) dx is ln|x + 1| + C.The second integral, ‚à´ x/(x¬≤ + 1) dx, can be solved with substitution. Let u = x¬≤ + 1, then du/dx = 2x, so (1/2) du = x dx. Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2) ‚à´ du/u = (1/2) ln|u| + C = (1/2) ln(x¬≤ + 1) + C.Putting it all together, the integral A is:[ln|x + 1| + (1/2) ln(x¬≤ + 1)] evaluated from 3/4 to 4/3.So, A = [ln(4/3 + 1) + (1/2) ln((4/3)¬≤ + 1)] - [ln(3/4 + 1) + (1/2) ln((3/4)¬≤ + 1)].Let me compute each part step by step.First, evaluate at the upper limit, x = 4/3:ln(4/3 + 1) = ln(7/3).(1/2) ln((4/3)¬≤ + 1) = (1/2) ln(16/9 + 1) = (1/2) ln(25/9) = (1/2) ln(25/9).So, the upper part is ln(7/3) + (1/2) ln(25/9).Now, evaluate at the lower limit, x = 3/4:ln(3/4 + 1) = ln(7/4).(1/2) ln((3/4)¬≤ + 1) = (1/2) ln(9/16 + 1) = (1/2) ln(25/16).So, the lower part is ln(7/4) + (1/2) ln(25/16).Now, subtract the lower part from the upper part:A = [ln(7/3) + (1/2) ln(25/9)] - [ln(7/4) + (1/2) ln(25/16)].Let me simplify this expression.First, combine the logarithms:ln(7/3) - ln(7/4) + (1/2)[ln(25/9) - ln(25/16)].Using the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b):ln((7/3)/(7/4)) + (1/2) ln((25/9)/(25/16)).Simplify the fractions inside the logarithms:(7/3)/(7/4) = (7/3) * (4/7) = 4/3.Similarly, (25/9)/(25/16) = (25/9) * (16/25) = 16/9.So, A = ln(4/3) + (1/2) ln(16/9).Simplify further:ln(4/3) + ln((16/9)^(1/2)) = ln(4/3) + ln(4/3) = 2 ln(4/3).Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check.Wait, (16/9)^(1/2) is indeed 4/3, so (1/2) ln(16/9) = ln(4/3). So, A = ln(4/3) + ln(4/3) = 2 ln(4/3).Alternatively, 2 ln(4/3) can be written as ln((4/3)^2) = ln(16/9).So, A = ln(16/9).Therefore, e^A = e^{ln(16/9)} = 16/9.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me recap to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Factored the denominator correctly: x¬≥ + x¬≤ + x + 1 = (x + 1)(x¬≤ + 1). Correct.2. Partial fractions decomposition: 1/(x + 1) + x/(x¬≤ + 1). Correct.3. Integrated each term: ln|x + 1| + (1/2) ln(x¬≤ + 1). Correct.4. Evaluated from 3/4 to 4/3:   Upper limit: ln(7/3) + (1/2) ln(25/9).   Lower limit: ln(7/4) + (1/2) ln(25/16).5. Subtracted lower from upper:   ln(7/3) - ln(7/4) + (1/2)(ln(25/9) - ln(25/16)).6. Simplified using ln(a/b) = ln a - ln b:   ln(4/3) + (1/2) ln(16/9).7. Recognized that (1/2) ln(16/9) = ln(4/3), so total A = 2 ln(4/3) = ln(16/9).8. Therefore, e^A = 16/9.Yes, that all checks out. I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer is 16/9."},{"question":"Sara's high school basketball team won 12 games. They were defeated during some games and played a total of 16 games. How many games did they lose?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many games Sara's high school basketball team lost. They played a total of 16 games and won 12 of them. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.First, let's break down the information given:1. Total games played: 162. Games won: 123. Games lost: This is what we need to find out.Since the team played 16 games in total and won 12, the remaining games must be the ones they lost. So, I think I can subtract the number of games they won from the total number of games to find out how many they lost.Let me write that down:Number of games lost = Total games played - Games wonPlugging in the numbers:Number of games lost = 16 - 12Okay, doing the subtraction:16 - 12 = 4So, the team lost 4 games. That makes sense because if they won 12 out of 16, there are 4 games left that they didn't win, which would be the losses.Wait, is there any other factor I need to consider? Like, could there be ties or cancellations? The problem doesn't mention anything about ties or games that didn't result in a win or loss. It just says they were defeated during some games, which implies that every game they played resulted in either a win or a loss. So, I don't need to worry about any other outcomes.Also, the total number of games played is 16, and they won 12, so subtracting gives us the number of losses. That seems correct.Let me double-check my calculation:16 (total games) - 12 (games won) = 4 (games lost)Yes, that looks right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a simple subtraction problem, and the answer makes sense in the context of the information provided.So, I'm confident that Sara's basketball team lost 4 games."},{"question":"A certain percentage of Jonessa's pay goes to paying tax.

What is the digit represented by Q?- textbf{(A) }1- textbf{(B) }3- textbf{(C) }5- textbf{(D) }7- textbf{(E) }9","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here with points P, Q, R, S, T, and U, each representing a different digit from 1 to 9. There are six lines, and each line passes through some of these points. The sums of the digits along each line are added together, and the total is 100. I need to figure out what digit Q represents.First, I should probably visualize the figure they're talking about. Since it's not provided, I'll assume it's a standard geometric shape with six lines connecting these points. Maybe something like a hexagon or a star with lines connecting various points. But without the figure, I'll have to work with the information given.Each line passes through some points, and the sum of the digits on each line is calculated. There are six lines, so six sums, and the total of these six sums is 100. Each point is a different digit from 1 to 9, so no repeats.Let me think about how to approach this. If I can figure out how many times each point is counted in the total sum, I might be able to relate that to the total of 100.Suppose each line has a certain number of points. For example, some lines might have three points, others might have two. The total sum would then be the sum of all these individual line sums.But since each point is used in multiple lines, the total sum of 100 is actually the sum of all the digits multiplied by the number of lines they're on. So, if I can figure out how many times each digit is counted, I can set up an equation.Let me denote the number of lines that pass through each point as follows:- Let‚Äôs say P is on x lines,- Q is on y lines,- R is on z lines,- S is on a lines,- T is on b lines,- U is on c lines.But wait, since there are six lines, and each line connects at least two points, the total number of point-line incidences is at least 12 (since each line has at least two points). However, depending on how the lines are arranged, some points might be on more lines than others.But without the figure, this is tricky. Maybe I can think of a common configuration. For example, if it's a hexagon with a star inside, each point might be on multiple lines.Alternatively, maybe it's a triangle with points inside, but again, without the figure, it's hard to be precise.Wait, maybe I can think of it as a magic star or something similar where each line has three points, and there are six lines, each connecting three points.But in that case, each point would be on multiple lines. For example, in a magic star with six points, each point is on two lines. But then the total number of point-line incidences would be 18, which is more than 12.But in our case, we have six lines, each contributing to the total sum. So, if each line has, say, three points, the total sum would be the sum of all digits multiplied by the number of lines they are on.But let's think differently. Maybe each line has two or three points. If I can figure out how many times each digit is added in the total sum of 100, I can relate it to the total sum of digits from 1 to 9.The sum of digits from 1 to 9 is 45. So, if each digit is counted once, the total would be 45. But since the total is 100, which is much larger, each digit is counted multiple times.Let me denote the number of times each digit is counted as follows:- Let‚Äôs say P is counted p times,- Q is counted q times,- R is counted r times,- S is counted s times,- T is counted t times,- U is counted u times.Then, the total sum would be p*P + q*Q + r*R + s*S + t*T + u*U = 100.But the sum of all digits is P + Q + R + S + T + U = 45 - (the sum of the three digits not used). Wait, but the problem says each of the points P, Q, R, S, T, U represents a different digit from 1 to 9. So, all six digits are used, and the remaining three digits (from 1 to 9) are not used. Wait, no, the problem says each of the points represents a different digit from 1 to 9, so all six points are different digits from 1 to 9, but the remaining three digits are not used in the figure.Wait, that might complicate things. So, the total sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is 45, but only six of them are used, so the sum of the digits used is 45 minus the sum of the three digits not used.But the total sum of the six lines is 100, which is the sum of the digits along each line. So, each digit is counted as many times as the number of lines it's on.Therefore, if I can figure out how many times each digit is counted, I can set up an equation.But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Maybe I can assume that each digit is on the same number of lines, but that might not be the case.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the lines as follows: suppose there are six lines, each connecting two points, so each line has two digits. Then, the total sum would be the sum of all pairs, but that would be 6*(sum of two digits). But that might not add up to 100.Alternatively, maybe some lines have three points, and others have two. For example, if there are three lines with three points each and three lines with two points each, the total sum would be 3*(sum of three digits) + 3*(sum of two digits).But let's try to think of it as a standard configuration. Maybe it's a hexagon with a center point connected to all six vertices, but that would make seven points, which is more than six. Hmm.Wait, maybe it's a triangle with points on the sides, but again, without the figure, it's hard.Alternatively, perhaps it's a star with six points, each line connecting three points. But again, not sure.Wait, maybe I can think of it as a combination of lines where each line has three points, and each point is on two lines. So, for six lines, each with three points, the total point-line incidences would be 18, so each of the six points is on three lines. But 6 points * 3 lines each = 18, which matches 6 lines * 3 points each.But then, the total sum would be 3*(P + Q + R + S + T + U) = 3*45 = 135, which is more than 100. So that can't be.Alternatively, maybe some points are on more lines than others.Wait, let's think of it as a triangle with three lines, each connecting two points, and then another three lines connecting midpoints or something. But again, without the figure, it's challenging.Alternatively, perhaps it's a cube's edges, but that's 12 lines, which is more.Wait, maybe it's a pentagon with a point in the center, but that would be six points, with five lines connecting to the center, but that's only five lines, and we need six.Alternatively, maybe it's a hexagon with a center point, but that would be seven points, which is more than six.Wait, perhaps it's a triangle with three lines, each connecting two vertices, and then three more lines connecting the midpoints, making six lines in total. Each midpoint would be a point, so six points in total: three vertices and three midpoints.In that case, each vertex is on two lines (the sides and the midlines), and each midpoint is on two lines as well. So, each point is on two lines. Therefore, the total sum would be 2*(sum of all six digits) = 2*45 = 90, but the total is 100, which is 10 more.Hmm, so that suggests that some points are on more lines than others.Alternatively, maybe some points are on three lines, and others on two.Let me denote the number of lines each point is on:Let‚Äôs say P is on x lines,Q is on y lines,R is on z lines,S is on a lines,T is on b lines,U is on c lines.Then, the total sum is xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.Also, since there are six lines, each line has at least two points, so the total number of point-line incidences is at least 12. But depending on how many points are on each line, it could be more.If each line has three points, then total incidences are 18, so x + y + z + a + b + c = 18.But if some lines have two points and others have three, then the total incidences would be between 12 and 18.But let's assume for simplicity that each line has three points, so total incidences are 18.Then, x + y + z + a + b + c = 18.But the sum xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.We also know that P + Q + R + S + T + U = sum of six different digits from 1 to 9. The minimum sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, and the maximum is 4+5+6+7+8+9=39. So, the sum is somewhere between 21 and 39.But if x + y + z + a + b + c = 18, and the sum xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100, then we can think of it as 18 times the average digit, which is around 5.5, so 18*5.5=99, which is close to 100. So, maybe the average is slightly higher.But let's think differently. If each point is on three lines, then each digit is counted three times, so total sum would be 3*(sum of digits) = 3*45=135, which is too high. So, some points must be on fewer lines.Wait, but we only have six points, and six lines. If each line has three points, that's 18 incidences, so each point is on three lines. But that would make the total sum 3*(sum of digits) = 135, which is more than 100. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe some lines have two points and some have three. Let's say there are k lines with three points and (6 - k) lines with two points. Then, total incidences would be 3k + 2(6 - k) = 3k + 12 - 2k = k + 12.Since we have six points, the total incidences must be equal to the sum of the number of lines each point is on, which is x + y + z + a + b + c.So, x + y + z + a + b + c = k + 12.But we also have that the total sum is xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.And the sum of the digits P + Q + R + S + T + U = S, where S is between 21 and 39.So, we have:x + y + z + a + b + c = k + 12,andxP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.But without knowing k or the individual x, y, z, a, b, c, it's difficult.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each line having two points, so total incidences are 12, meaning each point is on two lines. Then, the total sum would be 2*(sum of digits) = 2S = 100, so S = 50. But the sum of six digits from 1 to 9 can't be 50, since the maximum is 39. So, that's impossible.Therefore, some lines must have three points, and others two.Let me suppose that there are four lines with three points and two lines with two points. Then, total incidences would be 4*3 + 2*2 = 12 + 4 = 16.So, x + y + z + a + b + c = 16.And the total sum would be xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.Also, P + Q + R + S + T + U = S, where S is between 21 and 39.So, if I can find a combination where 16 times the average digit is around 100, but the average digit would be 100/16 ‚âà 6.25, which is plausible.But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can think of it differently.Let me consider that each line contributes its sum to the total. So, if I can figure out how many times each digit is counted, I can set up an equation.But without the figure, it's hard to know the exact configuration. Maybe I can think of it as a standard problem where each point is on two lines, except for one point which is on three lines. Then, the total incidences would be 2*5 + 3 = 13, which is less than 12, which doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe two points are on three lines, and the rest on two lines. So, total incidences would be 2*4 + 3*2 = 8 + 6 = 14, which is still less than 12.Wait, no, if each line has at least two points, the total incidences must be at least 12. So, if we have six lines, each with two points, that's 12 incidences. If some lines have three points, incidences increase.So, let's say we have m lines with three points and (6 - m) lines with two points. Then, total incidences are 3m + 2(6 - m) = m + 12.Since we have six points, the sum of the number of lines each point is on must equal m + 12.So, x + y + z + a + b + c = m + 12.Also, the total sum is xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.And P + Q + R + S + T + U = S, where S is between 21 and 39.Let me try m = 2, so two lines with three points and four lines with two points. Then, total incidences are 2 + 12 = 14.So, x + y + z + a + b + c = 14.And total sum is xP + yQ + zR + aS + bT + cU = 100.Also, P + Q + R + S + T + U = S.So, 14 times the average digit is 100, so average digit is about 7.14.But the sum S is between 21 and 39, so 14 times the average digit is 100, so average digit is 100/14 ‚âà 7.14.But the sum of the digits is S = P + Q + R + S + T + U, which is between 21 and 39.So, 14 times the average digit is 100, so average digit is about 7.14, which is plausible.But let's see if this works.Let me assume that two points are on three lines each, and the rest are on two lines each. So, x = y = 3, and z = a = b = c = 2.Then, total incidences would be 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14, which matches m = 2.So, the total sum would be 3P + 3Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100.But P + Q + R + S + T + U = S, which is between 21 and 39.So, 3P + 3Q + 2(R + S + T + U) = 100.But R + S + T + U = S - P - Q.So, substituting:3P + 3Q + 2(S - P - Q) = 100Simplify:3P + 3Q + 2S - 2P - 2Q = 100(3P - 2P) + (3Q - 2Q) + 2S = 100P + Q + 2S = 100But S = P + Q + R + S + T + U, which is the sum of all six digits.Wait, that's confusing. Let me denote S as the sum of the six digits, so S = P + Q + R + S + T + U.Wait, that's not correct because S is already a digit. Let me use a different notation. Let me denote the sum of the six digits as Sum = P + Q + R + S + T + U.So, Sum is between 21 and 39.Then, from earlier:P + Q + 2*(Sum - P - Q) = 100Wait, no, let's go back.We had:3P + 3Q + 2(R + S + T + U) = 100But R + S + T + U = Sum - P - QSo, substituting:3P + 3Q + 2*(Sum - P - Q) = 100Simplify:3P + 3Q + 2Sum - 2P - 2Q = 100(3P - 2P) + (3Q - 2Q) + 2Sum = 100P + Q + 2Sum = 100So, P + Q + 2Sum = 100But Sum = P + Q + R + S + T + USo, substituting:P + Q + 2*(P + Q + R + S + T + U) = 100Which is:P + Q + 2P + 2Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100Combine like terms:3P + 3Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100Wait, that's the same equation we started with. So, this approach isn't helping.Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that the total sum is 100, and the sum of the digits is between 21 and 39. So, 100 is much larger than the sum of the digits, meaning each digit is counted multiple times.If I can find how many times each digit is counted, I can set up an equation.Let me assume that each digit is counted either two or three times. So, some digits are on two lines, others on three.Let me denote the number of digits counted three times as t, and the rest (6 - t) counted two times.Then, the total sum would be 3t + 2(6 - t) = 3t + 12 - 2t = t + 12.But the total sum is 100, so:t + 12 = 100t = 88Wait, that can't be, because t is the number of digits counted three times, which can't be more than 6.So, this approach is flawed.Alternatively, maybe the total sum is the sum of the digits multiplied by the number of lines they're on.So, if each digit is on x lines, the total sum is x*(sum of digits) = 100.But x would vary per digit.Wait, but if I can find the sum of the number of lines each digit is on, that would be equal to the total incidences, which is m + 12, as before.But without knowing m, it's hard.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each line contributing its sum, and the total is 100.If I can figure out how many lines pass through each point, I can set up an equation.But without the figure, it's difficult. Maybe I can think of it as a standard problem where Q is the center point, connected to all other points, so Q is on multiple lines.Alternatively, maybe Q is on three lines, and the others on two lines each.So, if Q is on three lines, and the rest on two lines, then total incidences would be 3 + 2*5 = 13, which is less than 12, which doesn't make sense.Wait, no, total incidences must be at least 12.If Q is on four lines, and the rest on two lines each, total incidences would be 4 + 2*5 = 14, which is more than 12.So, maybe Q is on three lines, and two other points are on three lines each, and the rest on two lines.So, total incidences would be 3 + 3 + 2*4 = 3 + 3 + 8 = 14, which is more than 12.But let's see:If Q is on three lines, and two other points are on three lines each, then:Total incidences = 3 + 3 + 2*3 = 3 + 3 + 6 = 12, which matches the minimum.So, in this case, Q is on three lines, two other points are on three lines each, and the remaining three points are on two lines each.So, total incidences = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14, which is more than 12.Wait, no, if Q is on three lines, and two others are on three lines each, and the rest on two lines, then total incidences would be 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14.But we need total incidences to be m + 12, where m is the number of lines with three points.Wait, maybe m = 2, so two lines with three points, and four lines with two points, total incidences = 2*3 + 4*2 = 6 + 8 = 14.So, that matches.So, in this case, two lines have three points, and four lines have two points.And the total incidences are 14, which is equal to the sum of the number of lines each point is on.So, if Q is on three lines, and two other points are on three lines each, and the rest on two lines, then:x + y + z + a + b + c = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14.Which matches.So, the total sum would be 3P + 3Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100.But the sum of the digits is P + Q + R + S + T + U = Sum, which is between 21 and 39.So, 3P + 3Q + 2(R + S + T + U) = 100But R + S + T + U = Sum - P - QSo, substituting:3P + 3Q + 2*(Sum - P - Q) = 100Simplify:3P + 3Q + 2Sum - 2P - 2Q = 100P + Q + 2Sum = 100But Sum = P + Q + R + S + T + USo, substituting:P + Q + 2*(P + Q + R + S + T + U) = 100Which is:P + Q + 2P + 2Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100Combine like terms:3P + 3Q + 2R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100Which is the same equation as before. So, this approach isn't helping.Maybe I need to think of specific values.Let me assume that Q is on three lines, and two other points are on three lines each, and the rest on two lines.So, let's say Q is on three lines, and P and R are also on three lines each, and S, T, U are on two lines each.Then, the total sum would be 3P + 3Q + 3R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100.But the sum of the digits is P + Q + R + S + T + U = Sum.So, 3P + 3Q + 3R + 2S + 2T + 2U = 100Which can be written as 3(P + Q + R) + 2(S + T + U) = 100But S + T + U = Sum - (P + Q + R)So, substituting:3(P + Q + R) + 2*(Sum - (P + Q + R)) = 100Simplify:3(P + Q + R) + 2Sum - 2(P + Q + R) = 100(P + Q + R) + 2Sum = 100But Sum = (P + Q + R) + (S + T + U) = (P + Q + R) + (Sum - (P + Q + R)) = SumWait, that's not helpful.Alternatively, let me denote A = P + Q + R, and B = S + T + U.Then, Sum = A + B.From the equation:3A + 2B = 100And A + B = Sum, which is between 21 and 39.So, we have:3A + 2B = 100A + B = SumLet me solve for B from the second equation: B = Sum - ASubstitute into the first equation:3A + 2(Sum - A) = 1003A + 2Sum - 2A = 100A + 2Sum = 100But A = P + Q + R, which is part of the sum.Since Sum is between 21 and 39, let's see:A + 2Sum = 100So, 2Sum = 100 - ASince A is at least 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and at most 7 + 8 + 9 = 24.So, 2Sum = 100 - A, which would be between 100 - 24 = 76 and 100 - 6 = 94.So, Sum would be between 38 and 47.But Sum is between 21 and 39, so 38 ‚â§ Sum ‚â§ 39.Therefore, Sum must be 38 or 39.If Sum = 38, then 2Sum = 76, so A = 100 - 76 = 24.If Sum = 39, then 2Sum = 78, so A = 100 - 78 = 22.So, possible cases:Case 1: Sum = 38, A = 24Then, B = Sum - A = 38 - 24 = 14Case 2: Sum = 39, A = 22Then, B = 39 - 22 = 17Now, let's check if these are possible.Case 1: A = 24, B = 14A = P + Q + R = 24B = S + T + U = 14But S, T, U are distinct digits from 1 to 9, not used in A.So, the digits in A are three distinct digits summing to 24, and the digits in B are three distinct digits summing to 14, with all six digits being distinct.What's the maximum sum for B? The three smallest digits are 1, 2, 3, which sum to 6. The three largest digits not in A would be... Well, A has 24, which is the maximum sum for three digits (7 + 8 + 9 = 24). So, if A is 7, 8, 9, then B would have to be 1, 2, 3, which sums to 6, but we need B to be 14. So, this is impossible.Therefore, Case 1 is invalid.Case 2: Sum = 39, A = 22, B = 17So, A = P + Q + R = 22B = S + T + U = 17Again, A and B must be disjoint sets of digits.What's the maximum sum for A? 22. The maximum sum for three digits is 24, so 22 is possible.Possible combinations for A:Let me find three distinct digits that sum to 22.Possible combinations:9 + 8 + 5 = 229 + 7 + 6 = 228 + 7 + 7 = 22, but duplicates, so invalid.So, the possible sets for A are {9,8,5} and {9,7,6}.Similarly, B = 17, which is the sum of three distinct digits not in A.Let's check for each A:First, A = {9,8,5}Then, the remaining digits are 1,2,3,4,6,7We need three digits from these that sum to 17.Possible combinations:7 + 6 + 4 = 177 + 5 + 5 = 17, but duplicates.6 + 5 + 6 = 17, duplicates.Wait, 7 + 6 + 4 = 17Also, 7 + 7 + 3 = 17, duplicates.So, only {7,6,4} is possible.But 7 is not in A, so that's okay.So, B = {7,6,4}But wait, 7 is in B, but in A we have 9,8,5. So, 7 is not in A, so that's fine.But wait, 6 is not in A, so that's okay.So, digits would be:A: 9,8,5B: 7,6,4Sum = 9+8+5+7+6+4 = 39, which matches.Now, check if all digits are unique: 9,8,5,7,6,4 are all unique.Good.Now, let's see if this works.So, A = {9,8,5}, B = {7,6,4}Now, the total sum is 3A + 2B = 3*22 + 2*17 = 66 + 34 = 100, which matches.So, this works.Now, we need to figure out which digit is Q.But Q is one of the digits in A, which is {9,8,5}.So, Q is either 9,8, or 5.But we need to determine which one.Wait, but how?We need to look back at the configuration.Since Q is on three lines, and in our assumption, Q is one of the points in A, which are P, Q, R.But without knowing the exact figure, it's hard to determine which digit Q is.But maybe we can think of it as Q being the central point connected to all other points, so Q is connected to P, R, S, T, U.But in our case, Q is on three lines, so maybe connected to three other points.Wait, but in our earlier assumption, Q is on three lines, and P and R are also on three lines each.So, perhaps Q is connected to P, R, and one more point.But without the figure, it's hard to be precise.Alternatively, maybe we can think of the lines as follows:- Line 1: P, Q, R (sum = P + Q + R = 22)- Line 2: P, S, U (sum = P + S + U)- Line 3: R, T, U (sum = R + T + U)- Line 4: Q, T (sum = Q + T)- Line 5: Q, S (sum = Q + S)- Line 6: S, U (sum = S + U)Wait, this is a possible configuration.So, let's see:Line 1: P + Q + R = 22Line 2: P + S + ULine 3: R + T + ULine 4: Q + TLine 5: Q + SLine 6: S + UTotal sum = (P + Q + R) + (P + S + U) + (R + T + U) + (Q + T) + (Q + S) + (S + U) = 100Let's compute this:= P + Q + R + P + S + U + R + T + U + Q + T + Q + S + S + UCombine like terms:P: 2PQ: 3QR: 2RS: 3ST: 2TU: 3USo, total sum = 2P + 3Q + 2R + 3S + 2T + 3U = 100But we know that P + Q + R + S + T + U = 39So, 2P + 3Q + 2R + 3S + 2T + 3U = 100We can write this as:2(P + R + T) + 3(Q + S + U) = 100But P + R + T = (P + Q + R) + T - Q = 22 + T - QSimilarly, Q + S + U = (Q + S + U) = ?Wait, maybe it's better to express in terms of A and B.We have A = P + Q + R = 22B = S + T + U = 17So, total sum = 2P + 3Q + 2R + 3S + 2T + 3U = 100Let me express this in terms of A and B.We have:2P + 3Q + 2R = 2(P + R) + 3QBut P + R = A - Q = 22 - QSo, 2(P + R) + 3Q = 2(22 - Q) + 3Q = 44 - 2Q + 3Q = 44 + QSimilarly, 3S + 2T + 3U = 3(S + U) + 2TBut S + U = B - T = 17 - TSo, 3(S + U) + 2T = 3(17 - T) + 2T = 51 - 3T + 2T = 51 - TTherefore, total sum = (44 + Q) + (51 - T) = 95 + Q - T = 100So, Q - T = 5Therefore, Q = T + 5Now, since Q and T are digits from 1 to 9, and Q = T + 5, possible values are:If T = 1, Q = 6T = 2, Q =7T=3, Q=8T=4, Q=9But Q is in A = {9,8,5}, so Q must be 9,8, or5.From the possible values above, Q can be 6,7,8,9.But Q must be in {9,8,5}, so possible Q values are 8 or 9.If Q =8, then T = Q -5 =3If Q=9, then T=4Now, let's check if these are possible.Case 1: Q=8, T=3But T=3, which is in B = {7,6,4}. Wait, no, B is {7,6,4}, so T=3 is not in B. Wait, but T is part of B, which is S + T + U =17.Wait, no, B is S + T + U =17, but T=3, which is not in B. Wait, but B is {7,6,4}, so T must be one of these.Wait, no, in our earlier assumption, B = {7,6,4}, so T must be 7,6, or4.But if Q=8, then T=3, which is not in B. So, this is invalid.Case 2: Q=9, T=4T=4, which is in B = {7,6,4}, so that's okay.So, Q=9, T=4Therefore, Q=9So, the digit represented by Q is 9."},{"question":"Allan brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more balloons there.

So if Allan has 5 balloons, Jake must have 5 plus 1, which is 6 balloons. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.Wait, does the problem say anything about Jake buying more balloons after he arrived at the park?

What fraction of the area of triangle ABC does the area of triangle KEM occupy if BM:ME = 2:3?","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize it first. Since it's isosceles with base AC, that means sides AB and BC are equal in length. Okay, so point E is somewhere on the base AC. Then, on sides AB and BC, there are points K and M respectively. The lines KE and EM are parallel to BC and AB, respectively. Hmm, that's interesting.The question is asking what fraction of the area of triangle ABC is occupied by the area of triangle KEM, given that the ratio BM to ME is 2:3. Alright, so BM:ME = 2:3. I need to figure out how this ratio affects the areas.First, let me recall some properties of similar triangles because when lines are drawn parallel to sides of a triangle, they often create similar triangles. Since KE is parallel to BC, triangle AKE should be similar to triangle ABC. Similarly, since EM is parallel to AB, triangle EMC should also be similar to triangle ABC.Let me denote the ratio of similarity for triangle AKE. If KE is parallel to BC, then the ratio of their lengths should be equal to the ratio of AK to AB. Similarly, for triangle EMC, the ratio of EM to AB should be equal to the ratio of MC to BC.Given that BM:ME = 2:3, I can let BM = 2k and ME = 3k for some positive real number k. Therefore, the entire length of BC is BM + ME = 2k + 3k = 5k. So, BM is 2/5 of BC, and ME is 3/5 of BC.Since EM is parallel to AB, triangle EMC is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of similarity would be the ratio of EM to AB. But EM is 3k, and AB is equal to BC, which is 5k. So, the ratio is 3k/5k = 3/5. Therefore, the area of triangle EMC is (3/5)^2 = 9/25 of the area of triangle ABC.Similarly, since KE is parallel to BC, triangle AKE is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of similarity here would be the ratio of KE to BC. But KE is parallel to BC, and since E is on AC, the ratio of AE to AC would be the same as the ratio of AK to AB. Wait, I need to figure out where exactly E is located on AC.Given that BM:ME = 2:3, and since EM is parallel to AB, the ratio of AE to EC should be the same as the ratio of BM to ME, right? Because of the similar triangles. So, AE:EC = BM:ME = 2:3. Therefore, AE is 2/5 of AC, and EC is 3/5 of AC.Since triangle AKE is similar to triangle ABC with a ratio of 2/5, the area of triangle AKE is (2/5)^2 = 4/25 of the area of triangle ABC.Now, the area of triangle KEM is the area of triangle ABC minus the areas of triangles AKE and EMC. So, let's calculate that.Area of triangle ABC = 1 (let's assume it's 1 for simplicity).Area of triangle AKE = 4/25.Area of triangle EMC = 9/25.Therefore, the area of quadrilateral KEMC is 1 - 4/25 - 9/25 = 1 - 13/25 = 12/25.But wait, we need the area of triangle KEM, not quadrilateral KEMC. Hmm, how do we find that?Since KEM is a triangle inside KEMC, perhaps we can find the ratio of areas based on the heights or something. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that KEM is similar to some other triangle.Wait, let me think. Since KE is parallel to BC and EM is parallel to AB, the figure KEMC is a parallelogram? Because both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, KEMC is a parallelogram. Therefore, the area of triangle KEM would be half the area of parallelogram KEMC.So, if the area of KEMC is 12/25, then the area of triangle KEM is half of that, which is 6/25.Therefore, the fraction of the area of triangle ABC occupied by triangle KEM is 6/25.Wait, let me double-check that. If KEMC is a parallelogram, then yes, the area of triangle KEM would be half of KEMC. So, 12/25 divided by 2 is indeed 6/25. That seems right.So, the final answer should be 6/25."},{"question":"At Gaussville School, a total of 480 students voted for their favourite subject.

I need to find the value of the gross profit. Hmm, okay, let's see.First, I need to understand what gross profit is. From what I remember, gross profit is the difference between the sales price and the cost of the product. So, if I sell something for 81 and it cost me, say, X to produce or purchase it, then the gross profit would be 81 minus X.But in this problem, it says that the gross profit is 170% of the cost. That means the gross profit isn't just a simple difference; it's actually 1.7 times the cost. So, if the cost is X, then the gross profit is 1.7 * X.Wait, so if the gross profit is 1.7 times the cost, and the sales price is the cost plus the gross profit, then I can set up an equation like this:Sales Price = Cost + Gross ProfitBut since Gross Profit is 1.7 * Cost, I can substitute that in:81 = Cost + 1.7 * CostSo, combining like terms, that would be:81 = 2.7 * CostNow, to find the cost, I can divide both sides by 2.7:Cost = 81 / 2.7Let me do that division. 81 divided by 2.7. Hmm, 2.7 times 30 is 81, right? Because 2.7 times 10 is 27, so 2.7 times 30 is 81. So, Cost = 30.Now that I have the cost, I can find the gross profit by multiplying the cost by 1.7:Gross Profit = 1.7 * 30Let me calculate that. 1 times 30 is 30, and 0.7 times 30 is 21, so 30 + 21 = 51.So, the gross profit is 51.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If the cost is 30 and the gross profit is 51, then the sales price should be 30 + 51 = 81, which matches the given sales price. Also, 51 is indeed 170% of 30 because 1.7 times 30 is 51. So, everything checks out.I think I've got it right.

When ( k = 4), but not when ( k = 3 )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about sequences and differences. It defines something called the first difference, which is just the difference between consecutive terms, and then higher-order differences by applying the first difference repeatedly. The sequence given is ( u_n = n^3 + n ), and I need to figure out for which value of ( k ) the ( k )-th difference becomes zero for all ( n ). The options are from ( k = 1 ) up to ( k = 4 ).Alright, let me start by recalling what finite differences are. The first difference ( Delta(u_n) ) is ( u_{n+1} - u_n ). Then, the second difference is the difference of the first differences, and so on. For polynomial sequences, I remember that the ( k )-th difference of a polynomial of degree ( d ) is a constant if ( k = d ) and zero if ( k > d ). So, since ( u_n = n^3 + n ) is a cubic polynomial (degree 3), I expect that the third difference should be a constant, and the fourth difference should be zero.But let me verify this step by step to make sure I'm not making a mistake.First, let's compute the first difference ( Delta(u_n) ). Given ( u_n = n^3 + n ), so ( u_{n+1} = (n+1)^3 + (n+1) ). Let me expand ( (n+1)^3 ):( (n+1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 )So, ( u_{n+1} = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 + n + 1 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 4n + 2 )Now, subtract ( u_n ) from ( u_{n+1} ):( Delta(u_n) = u_{n+1} - u_n = (n^3 + 3n^2 + 4n + 2) - (n^3 + n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 2 )Okay, so the first difference is ( 3n^2 + 3n + 2 ), which is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). That makes sense because the original sequence was cubic, so the first difference should reduce the degree by one.Now, let's compute the second difference ( Delta^2(u_n) ). This is the first difference of the first difference.So, let's compute ( Delta(u_{n+1}) ):( Delta(u_{n+1}) = 3(n+1)^2 + 3(n+1) + 2 )Expanding ( (n+1)^2 ):( (n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 )So, ( Delta(u_{n+1}) = 3(n^2 + 2n + 1) + 3(n + 1) + 2 = 3n^2 + 6n + 3 + 3n + 3 + 2 = 3n^2 + 9n + 8 )Now, subtract ( Delta(u_n) ) from ( Delta(u_{n+1}) ):( Delta^2(u_n) = Delta(u_{n+1}) - Delta(u_n) = (3n^2 + 9n + 8) - (3n^2 + 3n + 2) = 6n + 6 )So, the second difference is ( 6n + 6 ), which is a linear polynomial (degree 1). Again, this aligns with the expectation that each difference reduces the degree by one.Next, let's compute the third difference ( Delta^3(u_n) ). This is the first difference of the second difference.First, compute ( Delta^2(u_{n+1}) ):( Delta^2(u_{n+1}) = 6(n+1) + 6 = 6n + 6 + 6 = 6n + 12 )Now, subtract ( Delta^2(u_n) ):( Delta^3(u_n) = Delta^2(u_{n+1}) - Delta^2(u_n) = (6n + 12) - (6n + 6) = 6 )So, the third difference is 6, which is a constant. That makes sense because the original sequence was cubic, so the third difference should be constant.Finally, let's compute the fourth difference ( Delta^4(u_n) ). This is the first difference of the third difference.Since the third difference is a constant (6), the difference of a constant is zero.Therefore, ( Delta^4(u_n) = 6 - 6 = 0 )So, putting it all together:- First difference: quadratic (non-zero)- Second difference: linear (non-zero)- Third difference: constant (non-zero)- Fourth difference: zeroTherefore, the condition ( Delta^k(u_n) = 0 ) holds when ( k = 4 ), but not for ( k = 3 ). So, the correct answer should be option D.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check each step.First difference:( u_{n+1} = (n+1)^3 + (n+1) = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 + n + 1 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 4n + 2 )Subtract ( u_n = n^3 + n ):( 3n^2 + 3n + 2 ). Correct.Second difference:Compute ( Delta(u_{n+1}) = 3(n+1)^2 + 3(n+1) + 2 = 3n^2 + 6n + 3 + 3n + 3 + 2 = 3n^2 + 9n + 8 )Subtract ( Delta(u_n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 2 ):( 6n + 6 ). Correct.Third difference:Compute ( Delta^2(u_{n+1}) = 6(n+1) + 6 = 6n + 12 )Subtract ( Delta^2(u_n) = 6n + 6 ):( 6 ). Correct.Fourth difference:Since third difference is 6, subtracting gives 0. Correct.So, yes, the fourth difference is zero, and the third difference is non-zero. Therefore, the answer is D."},{"question":"Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day.

I'll start by defining the percentage increase as ( P% ).The first puzzle has 1000 pieces. The second and third puzzles each have ( P% ) more pieces than the first puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces in each of the second and third puzzles can be expressed as:[1000 + frac{P}{100} times 1000]Since there are two puzzles with the increased number of pieces, the total number of pieces in all three puzzles is:[1000 + 2 times left(1000 + frac{P}{100} times 1000right) = 4000]Simplifying the equation:[1000 + 2000 + frac{2P}{100} times 1000 = 4000][3000 + 20P = 4000][20P = 1000][P = 50]Thus, the percentage increase in the number of pieces for the second and third puzzles compared to the first puzzle is ( 50% )."},{"question":"City X has a population 6 times as great as the population of City Y, which has a population some times as great as the population of City Z.

I remember that when dealing with systems involving square roots, it's often helpful to make substitutions to simplify the equations. Let me try that.Let me set:[u = sqrt{x^2 - 3y - 88}][v = sqrt{x + 6y}]So, substituting these into the original equations, the system becomes:[left{begin{array}{l}5u + v = 19 3u = 1 + 2vend{array}right.]Alright, now I have a system of linear equations in terms of u and v.

First, multiply 5 by (1 + 2v)/3:[frac{5(1 + 2v)}{3} + v = 19]To eliminate the denominator, I'll multiply the entire equation by 3:[5(1 + 2v) + 3v = 57]Expanding the left side:[5 + 10v + 3v = 57]Combine like terms:[5 + 13v = 57]Subtract 5 from both sides:[13v = 52]Divide both sides by 13:[v = 4]Now that I have v, I can substitute back into the expression for u:[u = frac{1 + 2(4)}{3} = frac{1 + 8}{3} = frac{9}{3} = 3]So, u = 3 and v = 4.

Let me write it as:[36y^2 - 195y + 159 = 0]To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula:[y = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Where a = 36, b = -195, c = 159.Calculating the discriminant:[b^2 - 4ac = (-195)^2 - 4 times 36 times 159][= 38025 - 4 times 36 times 159]Calculating 4 √ó 36 = 144Then, 144 √ó 159:Let me compute 144 √ó 160 = 23040, so 144 √ó 159 = 23040 - 144 = 22896So, discriminant:[38025 - 22896 = 15129]Wait, 38025 - 22896:38025 - 22000 = 1602516025 - 896 = 15129Yes, correct.So, sqrt(15129).

The prime factors of 12 are (2^2 times 3), and the prime factors of 16 are (2^4). The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors involved, which gives me (2^4 times 3 = 48).Next, I'll find the LCM of 18 and 24. The prime factors of 18 are (2 times 3^2), and the prime factors of 24 are (2^3 times 3). Taking the highest powers of the prime factors, the LCM is (2^3 times 3^2 = 72).Finally, I need to determine the LCM of the two results, 48 and 72. The prime factors of 48 are (2^4 times 3), and the prime factors of 72 are (2^3 times 3^2).

The original statement is: \\"There exists an ( x in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( x^2 + 2x + m leq 0 ).\\" And I need to find its negation from the given options.First, I remember that negating a statement in logic involves flipping the quantifiers and the inequality. The original statement is an existential quantifier, which means it's saying that at least one integer ( x ) satisfies the inequality ( x^2 + 2x + m leq 0 ). So, to negate this, I should change the existential quantifier \\"there exists\\" to a universal quantifier \\"for all,\\" and then negate the inequality inside.So, the negation should be: \\"For all ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( x^2 + 2x + m > 0 ).\\" That makes sense because if it's not true that there's some integer making the expression less than or equal to zero, then for every integer, the expression must be greater than zero.Looking at the options:A: There exists an ( x in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( x^2 + 2x + m > 0 ). Hmm, this is still an existential statement, just with the inequality flipped. But negation should change the quantifier, so this doesn't seem right.B: There does not exist an ( x in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( x^2 + 2x + m > 0 ). This is a bit tricky. It's saying that no integer makes the expression greater than zero. But actually, the negation should be about all integers making the expression greater than zero, not just that none do. So this might not be correct.C: For any ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( x^2 + 2x + m leq 0 ). Wait, this is a universal statement with the same inequality as the original. That doesn't seem right because negating an existential statement doesn't just make it universal with the same condition; it should flip the condition as well.D: For any ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( x^2 + 2x + m > 0 ). Yes, this matches what I thought earlier. It's a universal statement with the inequality flipped. So this should be the correct negation.Just to double-check, let's think about what each option means in plain language. The original statement is saying that there's at least one integer where the quadratic expression is non-positive. The negation would mean that for every integer, the expression is positive. That's exactly what option D is stating.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was remembering how to negate statements with quantifiers: switch existential to universal and negate the inner statement. So, I'm confident that D is the right answer."},{"question":"There are 90 children in a chess club.

Let me try to understand what each set represents and then figure out how they overlap.First, set M is defined as all real numbers x such that -2 is less than or equal to x, and x is less than 2. So, in interval notation, that would be [-2, 2). That means M includes all the numbers from -2 up to, but not including, 2. Got that.Now, set N is a bit more complicated because it's defined by an inequality: x squared minus 2x minus 3 is greater than or equal to zero. So, N = {x | x¬≤ - 2x - 3 ‚â• 0}. To find out what numbers x satisfy this inequality, I need to solve it.Let me write down the inequality: x¬≤ - 2x - 3 ‚â• 0. Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, it's helpful to factor the quadratic if possible, find the roots, and then determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is positive or negative.So, let's try to factor x¬≤ - 2x - 3. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Let me think... 3 and -1? Yes, because 3 * (-1) = -3 and 3 + (-1) = 2. Wait, but the middle term is -2x, so actually, it should be (x - 3)(x + 1). Let me check: (x - 3)(x + 1) = x¬≤ + x - 3x - 3 = x¬≤ - 2x - 3. Perfect, that's correct.So, the inequality becomes (x - 3)(x + 1) ‚â• 0. Now, to solve this inequality, I need to find the critical points where the expression equals zero. These are x = 3 and x = -1. These points divide the real number line into three intervals:1. x < -12. -1 < x < 33. x > 3Now, I need to test each interval to see where the product (x - 3)(x + 1) is positive or negative.Let's start with the first interval: x < -1. I'll pick a test point, say x = -2. Plugging into (x - 3)(x + 1): (-2 - 3)(-2 + 1) = (-5)(-1) = 5, which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.Next, the interval -1 < x < 3. Let's choose x = 0. Plugging in: (0 - 3)(0 + 1) = (-3)(1) = -3, which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.Finally, the interval x > 3. Let's pick x = 4. Plugging in: (4 - 3)(4 + 1) = (1)(5) = 5, which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.Since the inequality is ‚â• 0, we're looking for where the expression is positive or zero. Therefore, the solution set N includes the intervals where the expression is positive, which are x ‚â§ -1 and x ‚â• 3. So, N = (-‚àû, -1] ‚à™ [3, ‚àû).Now, I need to find the intersection of M and N. Remember, M is [-2, 2) and N is (-‚àû, -1] ‚à™ [3, ‚àû). The intersection will be the set of numbers that are in both M and N.Looking at M = [-2, 2) and N = (-‚àû, -1] ‚à™ [3, ‚àû), the overlap occurs where both sets have numbers. So, let's see:- The part of N that is (-‚àû, -1] overlaps with M's [-2, 2) from -2 up to -1. Because M starts at -2 and goes up to 2, but N only includes numbers up to -1 in this interval.- The other part of N is [3, ‚àû), but M only goes up to 2, so there's no overlap there.Therefore, the intersection M ‚à© N is the interval from -2 to -1, including both endpoints because M includes -2 and N includes -1.So, putting it all together, M ‚à© N = [-2, -1].I think that's it. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. Factoring the quadratic correctly, identifying the critical points, testing the intervals, and then finding the overlap with M. Yeah, that seems right."},{"question":" At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left.

Show that AB = CD and BC = AD.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here with four non-coplanar points A, B, C, and D. The problem states that angle ABC is equal to angle ADC, and angle BAD is equal to angle BCD. I need to show that AB equals CD and BC equals AD. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, since the points are non-coplanar, they don't all lie on the same plane, which means we're dealing with a three-dimensional figure. That might complicate things a bit, but maybe I can use some properties from three-dimensional geometry or maybe even some vector algebra. But let's see if I can approach this with just geometric theorems.Given that angle ABC equals angle ADC, maybe I can consider triangles ABC and ADC. If these angles are equal, perhaps there's some similarity or congruence between these triangles? But wait, triangles ABC and ADC share the side AC, right? So, if I can show that these triangles are congruent, then corresponding sides would be equal, which might help me get AB = CD and BC = AD.But hold on, for triangles to be congruent, we usually need more than just one angle equal. We need either SAS, SSS, ASA, or something like that. I only know one angle is equal, so maybe that's not enough. Maybe I need to use the other given condition, which is angle BAD equals angle BCD.Let me think about that. Angle BAD is at point A, between BA and DA, and angle BCD is at point C, between BC and DC. So, these are angles at different points but are equal. Maybe I can relate these angles somehow.Perhaps if I consider triangles ABD and CBD? Wait, angle BAD equals angle BCD, and maybe there's a common side or something. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to look for some cyclic quadrilateral properties? Because in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are equal, but I don't know if these points lie on a sphere or something.Wait, since the points are non-coplanar, they can't lie on a single plane, so a cyclic quadrilateral might not apply here. Maybe I need to use the cosine law or something like that.Let me try applying the cosine law to the given angles. For triangle ABC, the cosine law says:AC¬≤ = AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle ABC)Similarly, for triangle ADC:AC¬≤ = AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 * AD * CD * cos(angle ADC)But since angle ABC equals angle ADC, their cosines are equal. So, I can set these two expressions equal to each other:AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle ABC) = AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 * AD * CD * cos(angle ABC)Hmm, that's interesting. Let me rearrange this equation:AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle ABC) * (AB * BC - AD * CD)Okay, so that's one equation. Now, let's apply the cosine law to the other pair of equal angles, angle BAD and angle BCD.For triangle ABD, angle BAD is at A, so:BD¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - 2 * AB * AD * cos(angle BAD)Similarly, for triangle BCD, angle BCD is at C, so:BD¬≤ = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 * BC * CD * cos(angle BCD)Again, since angle BAD equals angle BCD, their cosines are equal. So, setting these equal:AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - 2 * AB * AD * cos(angle BAD) = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 * BC * CD * cos(angle BAD)Rearranging:AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle BAD) * (AB * AD - BC * CD)Alright, so now I have two equations:1) AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle ABC) * (AB * BC - AD * CD)2) AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle BAD) * (AB * AD - BC * CD)Hmm, so now I have two equations with some terms involving AB, BC, AD, CD, and the cosines of the angles. Maybe I can set up a system of equations here.Let me denote:Let‚Äôs let‚Äôs define some variables to simplify:Let‚Äôs say x = AB, y = BC, z = AD, w = CD.So, equation 1 becomes:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle ABC) * (x * y - z * w)Equation 2 becomes:x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * cos(angle BAD) * (x * z - y * w)Hmm, okay. So, now I have:1) x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * c1 * (x y - z w)2) x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * c2 * (x z - y w)Where c1 = cos(angle ABC) and c2 = cos(angle BAD).Now, if I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I get:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) - (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) = 2 * c1 * (x y - z w) - 2 * c2 * (x z - y w)Simplify the left side:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ - x¬≤ - z¬≤ + y¬≤ + w¬≤ = 2 y¬≤ - 2 z¬≤Right side:2 * c1 * (x y - z w) - 2 * c2 * (x z - y w)So, 2 y¬≤ - 2 z¬≤ = 2 c1 (x y - z w) - 2 c2 (x z - y w)Divide both sides by 2:y¬≤ - z¬≤ = c1 (x y - z w) - c2 (x z - y w)Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can think of another approach.Wait, since the points are non-coplanar, maybe I can use vector methods. Let me assign position vectors to the points A, B, C, D in 3D space.Let‚Äôs denote vectors:Let‚Äôs set point A as the origin, so vector A = (0,0,0).Let‚Äôs denote vector B = b, vector C = c, vector D = d.Then, angle ABC is the angle at point B between vectors BA and BC.Similarly, angle ADC is the angle at point D between vectors DA and DC.Given that angle ABC = angle ADC, so the angle between BA and BC equals the angle between DA and DC.Similarly, angle BAD is the angle at point A between vectors BA and DA, and angle BCD is the angle at point C between vectors BC and DC.Given that angle BAD = angle BCD.So, maybe I can express these angles using dot products.Recall that the cosine of the angle between two vectors u and v is (u ¬∑ v) / (|u| |v|).So, for angle ABC at point B:cos(angle ABC) = (BA ¬∑ BC) / (|BA| |BC|)Similarly, for angle ADC at point D:cos(angle ADC) = (DA ¬∑ DC) / (|DA| |DC|)Given that angle ABC = angle ADC, so their cosines are equal:(BA ¬∑ BC) / (|BA| |BC|) = (DA ¬∑ DC) / (|DA| |DC|)But BA is vector from B to A, which is A - B = -b.Similarly, BC is vector from B to C, which is c - b.DA is vector from D to A, which is A - D = -d.DC is vector from D to C, which is c - d.So, substituting:[(-b) ¬∑ (c - b)] / (| -b | |c - b|) = [(-d) ¬∑ (c - d)] / (| -d | |c - d|)Simplify:[(-b) ¬∑ (c - b)] = (-b) ¬∑ c + (-b) ¬∑ (-b) = -b ¬∑ c + |b|¬≤Similarly, [(-d) ¬∑ (c - d)] = -d ¬∑ c + |d|¬≤So, the equation becomes:(-b ¬∑ c + |b|¬≤) / (|b| |c - b|) = (-d ¬∑ c + |d|¬≤) / (|d| |c - d|)Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can write it as:(|b|¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (|b| |c - b|) = (|d|¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (|d| |c - d|)Similarly, for the other pair of angles, angle BAD and angle BCD.Angle BAD is at point A between BA and DA.BA is vector from A to B, which is b - a = b (since A is origin).DA is vector from A to D, which is d.So, cos(angle BAD) = (BA ¬∑ DA) / (|BA| |DA|) = (b ¬∑ d) / (|b| |d|)Similarly, angle BCD is at point C between BC and DC.BC is vector from C to B, which is b - c.DC is vector from C to D, which is d - c.So, cos(angle BCD) = (BC ¬∑ DC) / (|BC| |DC|) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (|b - c| |d - c|)Given that angle BAD = angle BCD, so:(b ¬∑ d) / (|b| |d|) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (|b - c| |d - c|)Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations from the angles:1) (|b|¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (|b| |c - b|) = (|d|¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (|d| |c - d|)2) (b ¬∑ d) / (|b| |d|) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (|b - c| |d - c|)These are vector equations, which might be complicated to solve directly. Maybe I can find some relationship between the vectors.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the triangles and use the sine law or something.Wait, another thought: if AB = CD and BC = AD, then the quadrilateral ABCD might be a parallelogram, but in 3D space. But since the points are non-coplanar, it can't be a planar parallelogram, but maybe a skew quadrilateral with opposite sides equal.But I'm not sure if that's necessarily the case. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, going back to the cosine law equations I had earlier:From angle ABC and ADC, I had:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * c1 * (x y - z w)From angle BAD and BCD, I had:x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 * c2 * (x z - y w)If I subtract these two equations, I get:(y¬≤ - z¬≤) = c1 (x y - z w) - c2 (x z - y w)But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can assume that AB = CD and BC = AD, and see if that satisfies the equations, but that feels like circular reasoning.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the ratio of the two equations.Let me denote equation 1 as:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 c1 (x y - z w)Equation 2 as:x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 c2 (x z - y w)If I divide equation 1 by equation 2, I get:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) / (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) = [2 c1 (x y - z w)] / [2 c2 (x z - y w)]Simplify:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) / (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) = (c1 / c2) * (x y - z w) / (x z - y w)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I need to think of another approach.Wait, another idea: if I can show that triangles ABC and ADC are congruent, then AB = CD and BC = AD would follow. But for that, I need more than just one angle equal. Maybe if I can find another pair of equal sides or angles.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the points are non-coplanar to argue about the distances.Wait, another thought: maybe using the concept of isometries or something. If the angles are equal, maybe there's a reflection or rotation that maps one triangle to another.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.Wait, going back to the vector approach, maybe I can set up some equations.From the first angle equality, we have:(|b|¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (|b| |c - b|) = (|d|¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (|d| |c - d|)Let me denote |b| = AB = x, |c - b| = BC = y, |d| = AD = z, |c - d| = CD = w.Then, the equation becomes:(x¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (z w)Similarly, from the second angle equality:(b ¬∑ d) / (x z) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (y w)Hmm, so now I have:1) (x¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (z w)2) (b ¬∑ d) / (x z) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (y w)These are two equations involving dot products. Maybe I can express b ¬∑ c and d ¬∑ c in terms of other variables.Wait, let's denote b ¬∑ c = m and d ¬∑ c = n.Then, equation 1 becomes:(x¬≤ - m) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - n) / (z w)Similarly, equation 2:(b ¬∑ d) / (x z) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (y w)Let me expand the numerator on the right side:(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c) = b ¬∑ d - b ¬∑ c - c ¬∑ d + c ¬∑ c = b ¬∑ d - m - n + |c|¬≤So, equation 2 becomes:(b ¬∑ d) / (x z) = (b ¬∑ d - m - n + |c|¬≤) / (y w)Let me denote b ¬∑ d = p.Then, equation 2 becomes:p / (x z) = (p - m - n + |c|¬≤) / (y w)So, now I have:From equation 1:(x¬≤ - m) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - n) / (z w)From equation 2:p / (x z) = (p - m - n + |c|¬≤) / (y w)Hmm, so now I have two equations with variables m, n, p, and |c|¬≤.But this seems complicated. Maybe I need to find another relationship.Wait, another thought: since the points are non-coplanar, the volume of the tetrahedron ABCD is non-zero. The volume can be expressed using the scalar triple product:Volume = (1/6) | (AB √ó AC) ¬∑ AD |But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, then certain properties hold.Wait, but I'm supposed to prove that AB = CD and BC = AD, so maybe if I can show that the opposite edges are equal, then the tetrahedron is isohedral or something.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, going back to the cosine law equations:From angle ABC and ADC, I had:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 c1 (x y - z w)From angle BAD and BCD, I had:x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤ = 2 c2 (x z - y w)If I add these two equations:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) + (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) = 2 c1 (x y - z w) + 2 c2 (x z - y w)Simplify left side:2 x¬≤ - 2 w¬≤ = 2 c1 (x y - z w) + 2 c2 (x z - y w)Divide both sides by 2:x¬≤ - w¬≤ = c1 (x y - z w) + c2 (x z - y w)Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can express c1 and c2 in terms of the sides.From the first cosine law equation:c1 = (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) / [2 (x y - z w)]From the second cosine law equation:c2 = (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) / [2 (x z - y w)]So, substituting back into the equation:x¬≤ - w¬≤ = [(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤) / (2 (x y - z w))] * (x y - z w) + [(x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤) / (2 (x z - y w))] * (x z - y w)Simplify:x¬≤ - w¬≤ = (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤)/2 + (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤)/2Combine the terms:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - z¬≤ - w¬≤ + x¬≤ + z¬≤ - y¬≤ - w¬≤)/2 = (2 x¬≤ - 2 w¬≤)/2 = x¬≤ - w¬≤So, x¬≤ - w¬≤ = x¬≤ - w¬≤Which is an identity. Hmm, so that doesn't give me new information.Maybe I need to think of another approach.Wait, another idea: if I can show that the triangles ABC and ADC are congruent, then AB = CD and BC = AD would follow. But for that, I need more than just one angle equal. Maybe if I can find another pair of equal sides or angles.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the points are non-coplanar to argue about the distances.Wait, another thought: maybe using the concept of isometries or something.

Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.Wait, going back to the vector approach, maybe I can set up some equations.From the first angle equality, we have:(|b|¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (|b| |c - b|) = (|d|¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (|d| |c - d|)Let me denote |b| = AB = x, |c - b| = BC = y, |d| = AD = z, |c - d| = CD = w.Then, the equation becomes:(x¬≤ - b ¬∑ c) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - d ¬∑ c) / (z w)Similarly, from the second angle equality:(b ¬∑ d) / (x z) = [(b - c) ¬∑ (d - c)] / (y w)Hmm, so now I have:1) (x¬≤ - m) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - n) / (z w)2) p / (x z) = (p - m - n + |c|¬≤) / (y w)Where m = b ¬∑ c, n = d ¬∑ c, p = b ¬∑ d.This seems complicated, but maybe I can solve for m and n in terms of p.From equation 1:(x¬≤ - m) / (x y) = (z¬≤ - n) / (z w)Cross-multiplying:z w (x¬≤ - m) = x y (z¬≤ - n)So,z w x¬≤ - z w m = x y z¬≤ - x y nRearranging:z w x¬≤ - x y z¬≤ = z w m - x y nSimilarly, from equation 2:p / (x z) = (p - m - n + |c|¬≤) / (y w)Cross-multiplying:p y w = (p - m - n + |c|¬≤) x zSo,p y w = p x z - m x z - n x z + |c|¬≤ x zRearranging:p y w - p x z = - m x z - n x z + |c|¬≤ x zFactor out x z:p (y w - x z) = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zHmm, so now I have two equations:1) z w x¬≤ - x y z¬≤ = z w m - x y n2) p (y w - x z) = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zThis is getting quite involved. Maybe I need to find another relationship or make an assumption.Wait, another idea: if AB = CD and BC = AD, then x = w and y = z. Let's see if that satisfies the equations.Assume x = w and y = z.Then, equation 1:z w x¬≤ - x y z¬≤ = z w m - x y nBut x = w and y = z, so:z x x¬≤ - x z z¬≤ = z x m - x z nSimplify:z x¬≥ - x z¬≥ = z x m - x z nFactor out z x:z x (x¬≤ - z¬≤) = z x (m - n)Divide both sides by z x (assuming z x ‚â† 0):x¬≤ - z¬≤ = m - nSo, m = n + x¬≤ - z¬≤Similarly, equation 2:p (y w - x z) = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zBut y = z and w = x, so:p (z x - x z) = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zSimplify:p (0) = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zSo,0 = - x z (m + n) + |c|¬≤ x zDivide both sides by x z (assuming x z ‚â† 0):0 = - (m + n) + |c|¬≤So,m + n = |c|¬≤But from earlier, m = n + x¬≤ - z¬≤So,(n + x¬≤ - z¬≤) + n = |c|¬≤2 n + x¬≤ - z¬≤ = |c|¬≤Hmm, so |c|¬≤ = 2 n + x¬≤ - z¬≤But I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, another thought: if AB = CD and BC = AD, then triangles ABC and ADC would have two sides equal and the included angle equal, which would make them congruent by SAS. But since the points are non-coplanar, the triangles can't be congruent in the usual sense, but maybe in 3D space, they can still have equal sides.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.Wait, going back to the original problem, maybe I can use the fact that the given angles are equal to set up some proportionality.Wait, another idea: maybe using the Law of Sines in the triangles.In triangle ABC, the Law of Sines says:AB / sin(angle ACB) = BC / sin(angle BAC) = AC / sin(angle ABC)Similarly, in triangle ADC:AD / sin(angle ACD) = CD / sin(angle CAD) = AC / sin(angle ADC)Given that angle ABC = angle ADC, so sin(angle ABC) = sin(angle ADC)So, from triangle ABC:AB / sin(angle ACB) = BC / sin(angle BAC) = AC / sin(angle ABC)From triangle ADC:AD / sin(angle ACD) = CD / sin(angle CAD) = AC / sin(angle ADC)Since sin(angle ABC) = sin(angle ADC), then AC / sin(angle ABC) = AC / sin(angle ADC)So, the ratios involving AC are equal.Therefore, AB / sin(angle ACB) = AD / sin(angle ACD)And BC / sin(angle BAC) = CD / sin(angle CAD)Hmm, interesting. So, AB / AD = sin(angle ACB) / sin(angle ACD)And BC / CD = sin(angle BAC) / sin(angle CAD)But I don't know if angles ACB and ACD are related, or angles BAC and CAD.Wait, another thought: since angle BAD = angle BCD, maybe there's a relationship between angles BAC and CAD.Wait, angle BAD is at point A, between BA and DA, and angle BCD is at point C, between BC and DC.If I can relate these angles to other angles in the triangles, maybe I can find some relationship.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.But I'm not sure. This is getting quite complicated.Wait, another idea: maybe using the concept of similar triangles.If I can show that triangles ABC and ADC are similar, then their sides would be proportional. But for similarity, we need more than just one angle equal.Alternatively, maybe triangles ABD and CBD are similar.Wait, angle BAD = angle BCD, and if I can find another pair of equal angles, then maybe they are similar.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, going back to the vector approach, maybe I can express the vectors in terms of each other.Let me assume that AB = CD and BC = AD, and see if that leads to a consistent solution.Assume AB = CD, so x = w.And BC = AD, so y = z.Then, from equation 1:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - y¬≤ - x¬≤ = 2 c1 (x y - y x)Simplify:0 = 2 c1 (0)Which is true, so no information.From equation 2:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - y¬≤ - x¬≤ = 2 c2 (x y - y x)Again, 0 = 0.So, that doesn't give me new information.Hmm, maybe I need to think of another approach.Wait, another idea: maybe using the fact that the given angles are equal to set up some proportionality between the sides.Wait, from the Law of Sines in triangles ABC and ADC, we had:AB / sin(angle ACB) = AD / sin(angle ACD)And BC / sin(angle BAC) = CD / sin(angle CAD)If I can relate angles ACB and ACD, and angles BAC and CAD, maybe I can find some relationship.But I don't know if those angles are equal or have any particular relationship.Wait, another thought: since angle BAD = angle BCD, maybe there's a relationship between the triangles ABD and CBD.In triangle ABD, angle at A is angle BAD, and in triangle CBD, angle at C is angle BCD.If I can show that these triangles are similar, then maybe AB / BC = AD / CD, which would imply AB / AD = BC / CD, which might help.But for similarity, I need more than just one angle equal. Maybe if I can find another pair of equal angles.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangles ABD and CBD.Wait, in triangle ABD:BD¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - 2 AB AD cos(angle BAD)In triangle CBD:BD¬≤ = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 BC CD cos(angle BCD)Given that angle BAD = angle BCD, so cos(angle BAD) = cos(angle BCD)Therefore,AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - 2 AB AD cos(angle BAD) = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - 2 BC CD cos(angle BAD)Rearranging:AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)Hmm, this is similar to one of the equations I had earlier.So, from this, I have:AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)Similarly, from the other angle equality, I had:AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD)So, now I have two equations:1) AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD)2) AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤ = 2 cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I get:(AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤) - (AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BC¬≤ - CD¬≤) = 2 cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD) - 2 cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)Simplify left side:AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ - CD¬≤ - AB¬≤ - AD¬≤ + BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ = 2 BC¬≤ - 2 AD¬≤Right side:2 cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD) - 2 cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)So,2 BC¬≤ - 2 AD¬≤ = 2 [cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD) - cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)]Divide both sides by 2:BC¬≤ - AD¬≤ = cos(angle ABC) (AB BC - AD CD) - cos(angle BAD) (AB AD - BC CD)Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Wait, another idea: maybe I can express cos(angle ABC) and cos(angle BAD) in terms of the sides.From the Law of Cosines:cos(angle ABC) = (AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AC¬≤) / (2 AB BC)cos(angle BAD) = (AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BD¬≤) / (2 AB AD)Similarly, from the other angle equality, cos(angle ADC) = (AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - AC¬≤) / (2 AD CD)And cos(angle BCD) = (BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - BD¬≤) / (2 BC CD)Given that angle ABC = angle ADC, so cos(angle ABC) = cos(angle ADC)Therefore,(AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AC¬≤) / (2 AB BC) = (AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - AC¬≤) / (2 AD CD)Multiply both sides by 2 AB BC AD CD:(AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AC¬≤) AD CD = (AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - AC¬≤) AB BCSimilarly, since angle BAD = angle BCD, so cos(angle BAD) = cos(angle BCD)Therefore,(AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BD¬≤) / (2 AB AD) = (BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - BD¬≤) / (2 BC CD)Multiply both sides by 2 AB AD BC CD:(AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BD¬≤) BC CD = (BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - BD¬≤) AB ADSo, now I have two equations:1) (AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AC¬≤) AD CD = (AD¬≤ + CD¬≤ - AC¬≤) AB BC2) (AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - BD¬≤) BC CD = (BC¬≤ + CD¬≤ - BD¬≤) AB ADThese are quite involved, but maybe I can manipulate them.Let me denote AB = x, BC = y, AD = z, CD = w, AC = m, BD = n.Then, equation 1 becomes:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤) z w = (z¬≤ + w¬≤ - m¬≤) x yEquation 2 becomes:(x¬≤ + z¬≤ - n¬≤) y w = (y¬≤ + w¬≤ - n¬≤) x zHmm, so now I have:1) (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤) z w = (z¬≤ + w¬≤ - m¬≤) x y2) (x¬≤ + z¬≤ - n¬≤) y w = (y¬≤ + w¬≤ - n¬≤) x zThese are two equations involving x, y, z, w, m, n.But I also know that in a tetrahedron, the lengths of the edges are related by the distances between the points.But this seems too complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.Wait, another idea: if I can show that AB = CD and BC = AD, then the equations would be satisfied.Assume AB = CD, so x = w.And BC = AD, so y = z.Then, equation 1:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤) y x = (y¬≤ + x¬≤ - m¬≤) x yWhich simplifies to:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤) x y = (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - m¬≤) x yWhich is true.Similarly, equation 2:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - n¬≤) y x = (y¬≤ + x¬≤ - n¬≤) x yWhich also simplifies to:(x¬≤ + y¬≤ - n¬≤) x y = (x¬≤ + y¬≤ - n¬≤) x yWhich is true.So, assuming AB = CD and BC = AD satisfies both equations.But does that mean it's the only solution? Not necessarily, but given the problem statement, it's likely that this is the case.Therefore, I can conclude that AB = CD and BC = AD."},{"question":"The expression y^2 + 12y + 40 can be written as a combination of a square of a binomial and an integer.

What is the probability that ( Q ) is closer to ( F ) than it is to either ( D ) or ( E )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about triangle DEF where DE is 6 units, EF is 8 units, and DF is 10 units. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected point Q inside the triangle is closer to point F than to points D or E. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably sketch the triangle to visualize it better. Since the sides are 6, 8, and 10, I notice that 6-8-10 is a Pythagorean triple because 6¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 36 + 64 = 100, which is equal to 10¬≤. So, triangle DEF is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at point F. That makes sense because in a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse, which is the longest side. So, DF is the hypotenuse here.Now, I need to find the region inside the triangle where any point Q is closer to F than to D or E. This sounds like a problem involving regions defined by perpendicular bisectors. In other words, I need to find the set of all points inside the triangle that are closer to F than to D or E. To do this, I remember that the set of points equidistant from two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So, if I can find the perpendicular bisectors of FD and FE, their intersection will help me define the region where points are closer to F than to D or E.Let me denote the perpendicular bisector of FD as line l and the perpendicular bisector of FE as line m. These bisectors will divide the triangle into regions where points are closer to one vertex than the others.Since triangle DEF is right-angled at F, I can assign coordinates to the points to make calculations easier. Let me place point F at the origin (0,0). Then, since DF is 10 units, and DE is 6 units, and EF is 8 units, I can assign coordinates as follows:- Point F: (0, 0)- Point D: (10, 0) because DF is the hypotenuse, but wait, actually, since it's a right-angled triangle at F, DF and EF should be the legs. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.Wait, DE is 6, EF is 8, DF is 10. So, if F is the right angle, then DF and EF are the legs, and DE is the hypotenuse? Wait, no, because DE is 6, which is shorter than DF (10). That doesn't make sense because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So, maybe I got the sides wrong.Wait, DE is 6, EF is 8, DF is 10. So, DE is one side, EF is another side, and DF is the third side. Since 6¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 10¬≤, that means DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. So, point D is connected to E and F, point E is connected to D and F, and point F is connected to D and E. So, actually, the right angle is at point E? Wait, no, because DE is 6, EF is 8, DF is 10. So, DE¬≤ + EF¬≤ = DF¬≤, which would mean that the right angle is at E. Hmm, but the problem says \\"triangle DEF,\\" so the vertices are D, E, F. So, if DE is 6, EF is 8, and DF is 10, then yes, DE¬≤ + EF¬≤ = DF¬≤, so the right angle is at E. So, point E is the right angle.Wait, but the problem didn't specify where the right angle is, but since DE¬≤ + EF¬≤ = DF¬≤, that implies the right angle is at E. So, point E is the right angle. So, I need to adjust my coordinates accordingly.Let me assign coordinates again:- Let‚Äôs place point E at the origin (0,0) since it's the right angle.- Then, point D can be at (6,0) because DE is 6 units.- Point F can be at (0,8) because EF is 8 units.So, triangle DEF has vertices at D(6,0), E(0,0), and F(0,8). The hypotenuse DF connects (6,0) to (0,8), which should be 10 units. Let me verify that: the distance between (6,0) and (0,8) is sqrt[(6-0)¬≤ + (0-8)¬≤] = sqrt[36 + 64] = sqrt[100] = 10. Perfect, that matches DF = 10.Now, I need to find the region inside triangle DEF where any point Q is closer to F(0,8) than to D(6,0) or E(0,0). To find this region, I need to construct the perpendicular bisectors of FD and FE because these bisectors will separate the regions where points are closer to F than to D or E.First, let's find the perpendicular bisector of FD. Points F(0,8) and D(6,0). The midpoint of FD is [(0+6)/2, (8+0)/2] = (3,4). The slope of FD is (0 - 8)/(6 - 0) = (-8)/6 = -4/3. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal, which is 3/4.So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of FD passing through (3,4) with slope 3/4 is:y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3)Similarly, let's find the perpendicular bisector of FE.Points F(0,8) and E(0,0). The midpoint of FE is [(0+0)/2, (8+0)/2] = (0,4). The slope of FE is (0 - 8)/(0 - 0), which is undefined, meaning FE is a vertical line. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will be a horizontal line passing through the midpoint (0,4). So, the equation is y = 4.Now, the region where points are closer to F than to D or E is the intersection of the regions defined by being closer to F than D and closer to F than E. So, it's the area where both conditions are satisfied.The perpendicular bisector of FD (y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3)) and the perpendicular bisector of FE (y = 4) intersect at some point. Let's find that intersection point.Substitute y = 4 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of FD:4 - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3) => 0 = (3/4)(x - 3) => x - 3 = 0 => x = 3.So, the intersection point is (3,4).Therefore, the region where points are closer to F than to D or E is bounded by the lines y = 4 and y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3). This region is a polygon within triangle DEF.Wait, actually, since we're dealing with a triangle, the region closer to F would be a smaller triangle or a quadrilateral. Let me think.The perpendicular bisector of FD (y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3)) and the perpendicular bisector of FE (y = 4) intersect at (3,4). Now, I need to see where else these bisectors intersect the sides of the triangle.First, let's see where the perpendicular bisector of FD intersects the sides of the triangle.The triangle has sides DE, EF, and FD. The perpendicular bisector of FD is the line y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3). Let's find where this line intersects the other sides of the triangle.First, check intersection with DE. DE is the base from D(6,0) to E(0,0), which is along y = 0.Set y = 0 in the equation:0 - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3) => -4 = (3/4)(x - 3) => Multiply both sides by 4: -16 = 3(x - 3) => -16 = 3x - 9 => 3x = -7 => x = -7/3.But x = -7/3 is outside the triangle since the triangle spans from x=0 to x=6. So, the perpendicular bisector of FD does not intersect DE within the triangle.Next, check intersection with EF. EF is from E(0,0) to F(0,8), which is along x = 0.Set x = 0 in the equation:y - 4 = (3/4)(0 - 3) => y - 4 = (3/4)(-3) => y - 4 = -9/4 => y = 4 - 9/4 = 7/4 = 1.75.So, the perpendicular bisector of FD intersects EF at (0, 1.75).Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of FE is y = 4, which is a horizontal line. It intersects FD at (3,4) as we found earlier, and it intersects EF at (0,4).Wait, EF is from (0,0) to (0,8), so y = 4 intersects EF at (0,4).So, now, the region where points are closer to F than to D or E is bounded by:- The perpendicular bisector of FD from (3,4) to (0,1.75)- The perpendicular bisector of FE from (0,4) to (3,4)- And the side EF from (0,1.75) to (0,4)Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.The region closer to F is where both conditions are satisfied: closer to F than D and closer to F than E.So, the boundaries are:1. Closer to F than D: above the perpendicular bisector of FD.2. Closer to F than E: above the perpendicular bisector of FE, which is y = 4.So, the region is the area above both bisectors. But since y = 4 is a horizontal line, and the perpendicular bisector of FD is a line going from (3,4) to (0,1.75), the region closer to F is the area above y = 4 and above the line from (3,4) to (0,1.75). But wait, above y = 4 would be outside the triangle because the triangle only goes up to y=8 at point F. Wait, no, y=4 is halfway up EF.Wait, actually, the region closer to F than E is above y=4 because below y=4, points are closer to E. Similarly, the region closer to F than D is above the line y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3). So, the intersection of these two regions is the area above both lines.But since y=4 is a horizontal line, and the other bisector is a line sloping upwards from (3,4) to (0,1.75), the region above both would be a polygon bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0,1.75) along the perpendicular bisector of FD- And from (0,1.75) back to (0,4) along EF.Wait, that doesn't make sense because from (0,1.75) to (0,4) is along EF, which is vertical. So, the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). Wait, that can't be right because (0,1.75) to (0,4) is a line segment, but the region should be a polygon.Wait, perhaps it's a triangle. Let me clarify.The region closer to F than E is above y=4, and closer to F than D is above the line y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3). So, the intersection of these two regions is the area above both lines. But since y=4 is a horizontal line, and the other line is above it from (3,4) to (0,1.75), the region is actually a polygon bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0,1.75) along the perpendicular bisector of FD- And from (0,1.75) back to (0,4) along EF.Wait, but (0,1.75) is below (0,4), so the region is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). But that can't be because (0,1.75) is below (0,4), so the region is actually a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,1.75). Wait, no, because from (0,1.75) to (0,4) is a vertical line, so the region is a trapezoid with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inequalities. The region closer to F than E is where the distance to F is less than the distance to E. Similarly, closer to F than D is where distance to F is less than distance to D.So, let's write the inequalities.Distance from Q(x,y) to F(0,8): sqrt[(x - 0)¬≤ + (y - 8)¬≤]Distance to E(0,0): sqrt[(x - 0)¬≤ + (y - 0)¬≤]Distance to D(6,0): sqrt[(x - 6)¬≤ + (y - 0)¬≤]We need:sqrt[x¬≤ + (y - 8)¬≤] < sqrt[x¬≤ + y¬≤] (closer to F than E)andsqrt[x¬≤ + (y - 8)¬≤] < sqrt[(x - 6)¬≤ + y¬≤] (closer to F than D)Let's square both sides to remove the square roots.First inequality:x¬≤ + (y - 8)¬≤ < x¬≤ + y¬≤Simplify:(y - 8)¬≤ < y¬≤Expand:y¬≤ - 16y + 64 < y¬≤Subtract y¬≤:-16y + 64 < 0-16y < -64Divide by -16 (inequality sign flips):y > 4So, the region closer to F than E is y > 4.Second inequality:x¬≤ + (y - 8)¬≤ < (x - 6)¬≤ + y¬≤Expand both sides:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 16y + 64 < x¬≤ - 12x + 36 + y¬≤Simplify:-16y + 64 < -12x + 36Bring all terms to left:-16y + 64 + 12x - 36 > 012x - 16y + 28 > 0Divide all terms by 4:3x - 4y + 7 > 0So, the inequality is 3x - 4y + 7 > 0.We can write this as y < (3x + 7)/4.Wait, but we need the region where both y > 4 and y < (3x + 7)/4.So, the region is the set of points where y > 4 and y < (3x + 7)/4.But we also need to consider the boundaries of the triangle. The triangle has vertices at D(6,0), E(0,0), and F(0,8). So, the region we're interested in is within this triangle.Let me plot these inequalities on the triangle.First, y > 4 is the area above the horizontal line y=4.Second, y < (3x + 7)/4 is the area below the line y = (3x + 7)/4.So, the intersection of these two regions within the triangle is a polygon bounded by:- The line y=4 from (0,4) to some point where y=4 intersects y = (3x + 7)/4.Wait, let's find the intersection of y=4 and y = (3x + 7)/4.Set 4 = (3x + 7)/4Multiply both sides by 4: 16 = 3x + 7Subtract 7: 9 = 3x => x = 3.So, the lines intersect at (3,4).Therefore, the region where both y > 4 and y < (3x + 7)/4 is bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0, something) along y = (3x + 7)/4Wait, but when x=0, y = (0 + 7)/4 = 7/4 = 1.75. But y=1.75 is below y=4, so that point is outside our region of interest because we're considering y > 4.Wait, that can't be. Let me think again.Actually, the line y = (3x + 7)/4 intersects the triangle at two points: one at (3,4) and another somewhere else.Wait, let's find where y = (3x + 7)/4 intersects the hypotenuse DF.The hypotenuse DF goes from D(6,0) to F(0,8). Its equation can be found as follows.The slope of DF is (8 - 0)/(0 - 6) = -4/3. So, the equation is y = (-4/3)x + 8.Set this equal to y = (3x + 7)/4:(-4/3)x + 8 = (3x + 7)/4Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:-16x + 96 = 9x + 21Combine like terms:-16x - 9x = 21 - 96-25x = -75x = 3So, x=3, then y = (-4/3)(3) + 8 = -4 + 8 = 4. So, the intersection is at (3,4), which we already knew.Therefore, the line y = (3x + 7)/4 only intersects the triangle at (3,4) and at another point. Wait, when x=0, y=7/4=1.75, which is on EF. So, the line y = (3x + 7)/4 intersects EF at (0,1.75) and DF at (3,4).Therefore, the region where y > 4 and y < (3x + 7)/4 is actually bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0,1.75) along y = (3x + 7)/4- And from (0,1.75) back to (0,4) along EF.Wait, but (0,1.75) is below y=4, so the region is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). But that doesn't make sense because (0,1.75) is below (0,4). So, perhaps the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,1.75). But (0,1.75) is not above y=4, so that can't be.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.The region where Q is closer to F than to D or E is the intersection of two regions:1. Closer to F than E: y > 42. Closer to F than D: y < (3x + 7)/4So, within the triangle, the region is bounded by y > 4 and y < (3x + 7)/4.But since y < (3x + 7)/4 is a line that goes from (0,1.75) to (3,4), and y > 4 is above y=4, the intersection is the area above y=4 and below y = (3x + 7)/4.But since y = (3x + 7)/4 at x=3 is y=4, and at x=0 is y=1.75, which is below y=4, the region is actually a triangle bounded by:- The line y=4 from (0,4) to (3,4)- The line y = (3x + 7)/4 from (3,4) to (0,1.75)- And the line EF from (0,1.75) to (0,4)Wait, but (0,1.75) is below y=4, so the region is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). But that can't be because (0,1.75) is not above y=4.Wait, perhaps the region is just a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). But that doesn't make sense because (0,8) is point F, and the region closer to F than E is above y=4, but closer to F than D is below y = (3x + 7)/4.Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to visualize it again.The region closer to F than E is above y=4, which is a horizontal line cutting the triangle into two parts: the lower part (y < 4) closer to E, and the upper part (y > 4) closer to F.Similarly, the region closer to F than D is below the line y = (3x + 7)/4, which is a line sloping upwards from (0,1.75) to (3,4).So, the intersection of these two regions is the area above y=4 and below y = (3x + 7)/4.But since y = (3x + 7)/4 at x=3 is y=4, and at x=0 is y=1.75, which is below y=4, the region is actually a triangle bounded by:- The line y=4 from (0,4) to (3,4)- The line y = (3x + 7)/4 from (3,4) to (0,1.75)- And the line EF from (0,1.75) to (0,4)Wait, but (0,1.75) is below y=4, so the region is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (0,1.75), and back to (0,4). But that can't be because (0,1.75) is not above y=4.Wait, perhaps the region is just a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). But that doesn't make sense because (0,8) is point F, and the region closer to F than D is below y = (3x + 7)/4, which at x=0 is y=1.75, so (0,8) is way above that.I think I need to approach this differently. Maybe I should find the area where both conditions are satisfied by integrating or by finding the intersection points.Alternatively, I recall that in a triangle, the set of points closer to a vertex than the others is called a Voronoi region, and it's bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.In this case, the Voronoi region for F is the intersection of the half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors of FD and FE.We already found the equations of these bisectors:1. Perpendicular bisector of FD: y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3)2. Perpendicular bisector of FE: y = 4The intersection of these two lines is at (3,4), as we found earlier.Now, to find the region closer to F, we need to determine which side of each bisector to take.For the perpendicular bisector of FD: points closer to F are on the side where y > (3/4)x + (something). Wait, let's rearrange the equation.The equation is y - 4 = (3/4)(x - 3). So, y = (3/4)x - (9/4) + 4 = (3/4)x + (7/4). So, the region closer to F is above this line.Similarly, for the perpendicular bisector of FE: y = 4. The region closer to F is above this line.Therefore, the region closer to F than to D or E is the intersection of y > (3/4)x + 7/4 and y > 4.But since y > 4 is a higher threshold, the region is actually bounded by y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4. However, since (3/4)x + 7/4 at x=0 is 7/4=1.75, which is less than 4, the region is simply y > 4 within the triangle.Wait, that can't be right because the perpendicular bisector of FD also plays a role. Let me think again.Actually, the region closer to F than both D and E is the intersection of the two regions: closer to F than D and closer to F than E. So, it's the area where both conditions are satisfied.We have:- Closer to F than E: y > 4- Closer to F than D: y > (3/4)x + 7/4So, the region is where both y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4.But since y > 4 is a higher threshold, the region is bounded by y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4, but we need to find where both are satisfied.However, since (3/4)x + 7/4 is less than 4 for x < 3, because when x=3, (3/4)*3 + 7/4 = 9/4 + 7/4 = 16/4 = 4.So, for x < 3, (3/4)x + 7/4 < 4, and for x > 3, (3/4)x + 7/4 > 4.But since our triangle only goes up to x=6, but the region of interest is within the triangle where y > 4.Wait, let me clarify.The region where both y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4 is the area above both lines. Since y=4 is a horizontal line, and y = (3/4)x + 7/4 is a line that intersects y=4 at x=3, the region is bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0, something) along y = (3/4)x + 7/4But wait, when x=0, y=7/4=1.75, which is below y=4, so the region is actually bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0,8) along the line y = (3/4)x + 7/4Wait, no, because y = (3/4)x + 7/4 at x=0 is 1.75, not 8. So, perhaps the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). But that doesn't make sense because (0,8) is point F, and the line y = (3/4)x + 7/4 doesn't pass through (0,8).Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me plot the lines.- The line y=4 is a horizontal line cutting the triangle at (0,4) and (6,4), but since the triangle only goes up to y=8 at (0,8), the intersection at (6,4) is outside the triangle because the hypotenuse DF goes from (6,0) to (0,8), so at x=6, y=0.Wait, no, the line y=4 intersects DF at some point. Let me find where y=4 intersects DF.The equation of DF is y = (-4/3)x + 8.Set y=4:4 = (-4/3)x + 8Subtract 8:-4 = (-4/3)xMultiply both sides by (-3/4):x = 3.So, y=4 intersects DF at (3,4).Therefore, the line y=4 intersects the triangle at (0,4) and (3,4).Similarly, the line y = (3/4)x + 7/4 intersects the triangle at (0,1.75) and (3,4).So, the region where both y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4 is the area above both lines within the triangle.But since y=4 is above y = (3/4)x + 7/4 for x < 3, the region is actually just the area above y=4 within the triangle.Wait, no, because for x < 3, y=4 is above y = (3/4)x + 7/4, so the region where both y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4 is just the area above y=4.But that can't be because the perpendicular bisector of FD also plays a role in defining the region closer to F than D.Wait, perhaps the region is a polygon bounded by:- From (0,4) to (3,4) along y=4- From (3,4) to (0,8) along the line y = (-4/3)x + 8 (the hypotenuse DF)- And from (0,8) back to (0,4) along EF.Wait, that makes sense because the region closer to F than E is above y=4, and closer to F than D is above the perpendicular bisector of FD, which is y = (3/4)x + 7/4. But since y=4 is above this line for x < 3, the region closer to F is the area above y=4 and above y = (3/4)x + 7/4, which is the triangle bounded by (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).Wait, but (0,8) is point F, and the line from (3,4) to (0,8) is the hypotenuse DF, which is y = (-4/3)x + 8.So, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).Let me calculate the area of this region.The base of this triangle is along EF from (0,4) to (0,8), which is 4 units. The height is the horizontal distance from (0,4) to (3,4), which is 3 units.But actually, it's a right-angled triangle with base 3 and height 4, so area is (1/2)*3*4 = 6.Wait, but let me verify.The triangle has vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). So, it's a right-angled triangle with legs along the y-axis from (0,4) to (0,8) (length 4) and along the line y=4 from (0,4) to (3,4) (length 3). So, the area is indeed (1/2)*3*4 = 6.Now, the area of the entire triangle DEF is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*6*8 = 24.Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected point Q is closer to F than to D or E is the area of the region closer to F divided by the area of the entire triangle, which is 6/24 = 1/4.Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 1/2. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me double-check the area of the region closer to F.The region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). The area is indeed (1/2)*3*4 = 6.But wait, another way to think about it is that the region closer to F is a smaller triangle within DEF. The area of DEF is 24, so 6/24 = 1/4.But I recall that in a right-angled triangle, the region closer to the right-angle vertex is 1/4 of the area. So, maybe 1/4 is correct.Wait, but earlier I thought the region was a rectangle, but that was a mistake. The correct region is a triangle with area 6, so the probability is 1/4.But let me think again. The region closer to F is where y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4. But since y=4 is above y = (3/4)x + 7/4 for x < 3, the region is just the area above y=4, which is a trapezoid.Wait, no, because the line y = (3/4)x + 7/4 intersects y=4 at (3,4), so the region closer to F is the area above y=4 and above y = (3/4)x + 7/4, which is the triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the area is 6, and the total area is 24, so the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.But wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the area of the region. Let me use integration to verify.The region is bounded by y=4, y = (-4/3)x + 8, and x=0.So, the area can be calculated as the integral from x=0 to x=3 of [(-4/3)x + 8 - 4] dx.Which is the integral from 0 to 3 of [(-4/3)x + 4] dx.Compute the integral:‚à´[(-4/3)x + 4] dx from 0 to 3= [ (-2/3)x¬≤ + 4x ] from 0 to 3= [ (-2/3)(9) + 12 ] - [0 + 0]= [ -6 + 12 ] = 6So, the area is indeed 6.Therefore, the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in identifying the region. Let me think again.The region closer to F than to D or E is the intersection of the regions closer to F than D and closer to F than E.We found that closer to F than E is y > 4, and closer to F than D is y > (3/4)x + 7/4.So, the intersection is the area where both are true, which is y > 4 and y > (3/4)x + 7/4.But since y=4 is above y = (3/4)x + 7/4 for x < 3, the region is the area above y=4 and above y = (3/4)x + 7/4, which is the triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).So, the area is 6, and the total area is 24, so the probability is 1/4.But I'm still a bit unsure because I remember that in some cases, the region closer to a vertex is 1/4 of the area, but I want to make sure.Alternatively, I can use the concept of Voronoi regions. In a triangle, the region closer to a vertex is a polygon bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meeting at that vertex.In this case, the Voronoi region for F is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of FD and FE, which we found intersect at (3,4). So, the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8), which is a triangle with area 6.Therefore, the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.Wait, but I think I made a mistake in calculating the area of the region. Let me think again.The region closer to F is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). The base is from (0,4) to (0,8), which is 4 units. The height is from (0,4) to (3,4), which is 3 units. So, the area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*4*3 = 6.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think about the perpendicular bisectors again.The perpendicular bisector of FD is y = (3/4)x + 7/4, and the perpendicular bisector of FE is y=4. The intersection is at (3,4). So, the region closer to F is the area above both lines, which is the triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the area is 6, and the total area is 24, so the probability is 1/4.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Let me double-check the coordinates.We have triangle DEF with DE=6, EF=8, DF=10. Since DE¬≤ + EF¬≤ = DF¬≤, the right angle is at E. So, E is at (0,0), D at (6,0), and F at (0,8).Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the area of the triangle is (1/2)*6*8 = 24.The region closer to F is the triangle with area 6, so the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the region's area. Let me use another method to calculate it.The region closer to F is the set of points where distance to F is less than distance to D and less than distance to E.We can use the concept of regions divided by perpendicular bisectors.The perpendicular bisector of FD is y = (3/4)x + 7/4, and the perpendicular bisector of FE is y=4.The intersection of these bisectors is at (3,4).So, the region closer to F is the area above both bisectors.But since y=4 is a horizontal line, and the other bisector is a line sloping upwards, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8).The area of this triangle is 6, as calculated before.Therefore, the probability is 6/24 = 1/4.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me check again.The problem states: \\"In triangle DEF, DE = 6, EF = 8, and DF = 10. Point Q is randomly selected inside triangle DEF. What is the probability that Q is closer to F than it is to either D or E?\\"Yes, that's correct.So, after careful consideration, I think the probability is 1/4.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the region's area. Let me think again.The region closer to F is a triangle with vertices at (0,4), (3,4), and (0,8). The area is 6.The total area of the triangle is 24.So, 6/24 = 1/4.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the probability is 1/4."},{"question":"The condition \\"_M_ > _N_\\" is equivalent to \\"log<sub>2</sub>_M_ > log<sub>2</sub>_N_\\" is a ______ condition (choose one from \\"necessary and sufficient\\", \\"sufficient but not necessary\\", \\"necessary but not sufficient\\").","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here that says: \\"The condition 'M > N' is equivalent to 'log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN' is a ______ condition.\\" And I need to choose between \\"necessary and sufficient,\\" \\"sufficient but not necessary,\\" or \\"necessary but not sufficient.\\" Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that logarithms are functions that can transform multiplicative relationships into additive ones, but I'm not sure how that plays into this problem. Maybe I should start by recalling what it means for two conditions to be equivalent. If two conditions are equivalent, it means that each one implies the other. So, if \\"M > N\\" is equivalent to \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN,\\" then both \\"M > N\\" implies \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" and \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" implies \\"M > N\\" should hold true.But wait, I remember that logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers. So, if M and N are both positive, then log‚ÇÇM and log‚ÇÇN are defined. But if M or N are zero or negative, the logarithm isn't defined. Does that affect the equivalence?Let me think. If M and N are positive, then log‚ÇÇ is a strictly increasing function, right? That means if M > N, then log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN, and vice versa. So, in the case where both M and N are positive, \\"M > N\\" and \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" are indeed equivalent. That would mean they are both necessary and sufficient conditions for each other.But what if M or N are not positive? For example, suppose M is 2 and N is 1. Then M > N is true, and log‚ÇÇ2 > log‚ÇÇ1, which is 1 > 0, also true. But if M is -2 and N is -1, then M > N is true because -2 is greater than -1. However, log‚ÇÇ(-2) and log‚ÇÇ(-1) are undefined in the real numbers. So, in this case, \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" isn't even a valid statement because the logarithms aren't defined.Does that mean that \\"M > N\\" can sometimes be true while \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" isn't even applicable? If so, then \\"M > N\\" isn't sufficient to guarantee that \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" because the latter might not even be defined. However, if \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" is true, then it must be that M and N are positive, and since log‚ÇÇ is increasing, M > N must also be true. So, \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" implies \\"M > N,\\" but \\"M > N\\" doesn't necessarily imply \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" because M and N could be negative or zero.Therefore, \\"M > N\\" is a necessary condition for \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" because if \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" is true, then \\"M > N\\" must be true. But it's not sufficient because \\"M > N\\" could be true without \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" being defined or true. So, \\"M > N\\" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN.\\"Wait, let me double-check that. If \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" is true, then M and N must be positive, and since log‚ÇÇ is increasing, M > N must hold. So, \\"M > N\\" is necessary for \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN.\\" However, \\"M > N\\" can be true even if M and N are negative, in which case \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN\\" isn't defined. So, \\"M > N\\" doesn't guarantee \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN,\\" making it not sufficient.Yeah, that makes sense. So, \\"M > N\\" is necessary but not sufficient for \\"log‚ÇÇM > log‚ÇÇN.\\" Therefore, the correct answer should be \\"necessary but not sufficient.\\""},{"question":"As a child, Bobby was able to jump rope 30 times per minute, do 15 sit-ups per minute, and complete 10 push-ups per minute.

If Bobby wants to jump 200 times, do 150 sit-ups, and complete 100 push-ups, how long in minutes will it take him to complete all these exercises now that he is an adult?","answer":"First, I need to determine how long it takes Bobby to complete each exercise individually.For jumping rope, Bobby can do 1 jump per second. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, he can complete 60 jumps per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to complete 200 jumps, I divide the total number of jumps by the number of jumps per minute:200 jumps √∑ 60 jumps per minute = 3.33 minutesNext, for sit-ups, Bobby can do 25 sit-ups per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to complete 150 sit-ups, I divide the total number of sit-ups by the number of sit-ups per minute:150 sit-ups √∑ 25 sit-ups per minute = 6 minutesFor push-ups, Bobby can do 20 push-ups per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to complete 100 push-ups, I divide the total number of push-ups by the number of push-ups per minute:100 push-ups √∑ 20 push-ups per minute = 5 minutesFinally, I add up the time for each exercise to find the total time required:3.33 minutes (jump rope) + 6 minutes (sit-ups) + 5 minutes (push-ups) = 14.33 minutesTherefore, it will take Bobby approximately 14.33 minutes to complete all the exercises as an adult."},{"question":"There are 324 coins in total, consisting of 20 paise and 25 paise coins.

The options are A: ( log_3 10 ), B: ( lg 3 ), C: ( 10^3 ), and D: ( 3^{10} ).Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, the function ( f ) is defined in a particular way: when its input is ( 10^x ), the output is ( x ). So, ( f(10^x) = x ). That seems like a logarithmic relationship because logarithms are the inverse of exponentials. Let me think about what ( f ) does. If I give it ( 10^x ), it gives me back ( x ). So, essentially, ( f ) is taking a number that's a power of 10 and returning the exponent. That sounds exactly like a logarithm with base 10. So, ( f(y) = log_{10} y ) because if ( y = 10^x ), then ( log_{10} y = x ).So, if ( f(y) = log_{10} y ), then ( f(3) ) would be ( log_{10} 3 ). Looking at the options, B is ( lg 3 ), which is another way of writing ( log_{10} 3 ). So, that seems like the answer.Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. The function ( f ) is defined such that ( f(10^x) = x ). So, if I set ( y = 10^x ), then ( f(y) = x ). Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, ( log_{10} y = x ). So, ( f(y) = log_{10} y ). Therefore, ( f(3) = log_{10} 3 ), which is ( lg 3 ). Yeah, that makes sense.Let me consider the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option A is ( log_3 10 ). That's the inverse of ( log_{10} 3 ), right? Because ( log_b a = 1 / log_a b ). So, ( log_3 10 ) is not the same as ( log_{10} 3 ). So, A is not correct.Option C is ( 10^3 ), which is 1000. That doesn't seem related because ( f(3) ) is supposed to give us an exponent, not a large number like 1000. Similarly, option D is ( 3^{10} ), which is 59049. That's way too big and doesn't fit the pattern of the function ( f ).So, going back, ( f(10^x) = x ) implies that ( f ) is the logarithm base 10 function. Therefore, ( f(3) = log_{10} 3 ), which is ( lg 3 ). So, the correct answer should be B.Just to visualize it, if I plug ( x = log_{10} 3 ) into ( 10^x ), I get ( 10^{log_{10} 3} = 3 ). So, ( f(3) = log_{10} 3 ). That checks out.I think I've considered all the options and made sure that B is the correct one. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that B is the right answer."},{"question":"A number is doubled and 9 is added. If the resultant is trebled, it becomes a certain value.

Start with the inequality that ensures the expression inside the square root is non-negative:   [   2x - 1 geq 0   ]2. Solve for ( x ) by isolating it on one side of the inequality:   [   2x geq 1   ]3. Divide both sides of the inequality by 2 to find the value of ( x ):   [   x geq frac{1}{2}   ]Therefore, the range of real numbers ( x ) for which the expression ( sqrt{2x - 1} ) is meaningful is all real numbers greater than or equal to ( frac{1}{2} )."},{"question":"The inequality left(1-aright) x gt 2 is transformed into x lt dfrac{2}{1-a}, then the possible values of a are:A: a gt 0B: a lt 0C: a gt 1D: a lt 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: (1 - a)x > 2. And it's transformed into x < 2/(1 - a). I need to figure out what possible values of 'a' make this transformation valid. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.First, I remember that when you have an inequality like this and you want to solve for x, you usually try to isolate x. So, in this case, I need to get x by itself on one side. The coefficient of x is (1 - a), so I think I should divide both sides by (1 - a) to get x by itself.But wait, I recall that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, I need to be careful about the sign of (1 - a). If (1 - a) is positive, then dividing both sides by it won't change the inequality sign. But if (1 - a) is negative, then I have to flip the inequality sign.In the transformed inequality, it's x < 2/(1 - a). So, the inequality sign has flipped from '>' to '<'. That must mean that when we divided both sides by (1 - a), we had to flip the inequality sign because (1 - a) was negative. Therefore, (1 - a) must be less than zero.Let me write that down: 1 - a < 0. Solving for 'a', I subtract 1 from both sides: -a < -1. Then, multiplying both sides by -1 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign again because I'm multiplying by a negative), I get a > 1.So, that means 'a' has to be greater than 1 for the transformation to be valid. Let me double-check that. If a is greater than 1, then (1 - a) is negative. Dividing both sides of the original inequality by a negative number would indeed flip the inequality sign, resulting in x < 2/(1 - a). That makes sense.Wait, what if (1 - a) is positive? If a is less than 1, then (1 - a) is positive, and dividing both sides by a positive number wouldn't change the inequality sign. So, in that case, the transformed inequality would be x > 2/(1 - a), which is different from what's given. Therefore, the transformation to x < 2/(1 - a) specifically requires that (1 - a) is negative, meaning a > 1.I think that's it. So, the possible values of 'a' are those greater than 1."},{"question":"What is the difference between 80 % of 170 and 35 % of 300?","answer":"First, I need to calculate 80% of 170.

The total area cut off is 200 square meters, and I need to find the length of PR. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, since it's a square, all sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of the square as 's'. So, the area of the square is s squared. Now, they've cut off four triangles, two pairs of identical ones, and the total area cut off is 200 m¬≤. So, the area of the remaining rectangle PQRS must be the area of the square minus 200 m¬≤.I think the key here is to figure out the dimensions of the rectangle PQRS because once I have that, I can find the length of the diagonal PR using the Pythagorean theorem. But to get the dimensions of PQRS, I need to understand how the triangles are cut off.Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the points P, Q, R, S are located along the sides of the square. Specifically, P is on side AB, Q is on side BC, R is on side CD, and S is on side DA. Each of these points is a certain distance from the corners, forming the triangles.Since the triangles are isosceles, the legs from the corners to these points P, Q, R, S must be equal. Let me denote the distance from A to S as 'x' and from D to R as 'y'. Since the triangles are identical, the distance from B to P should also be 'y', and from C to Q should be 'x'. Wait, is that right? Let me think.If the triangles are isosceles, then the two legs from each corner should be equal. So, for triangle APS, the legs AP and AS should be equal. Similarly, for triangle DSR, the legs DS and DR should be equal. So, if AS is 'x', then AP is also 'x'. Similarly, if SD is 'y', then DR is also 'y'. Therefore, BP would be AB - AP, which is s - x, and CQ would be BC - BQ, which is s - y.But wait, the triangles cut off are two pairs of identical isosceles triangles. So, maybe the triangles on adjacent sides are identical? Let me clarify.Looking back at the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as a = (0,1), b = (1,1), c = (1,0), d = (0,0), s = (0, 1/3), p = (2/3,1), q = (1, 2/3), r = (1/3,0). So, in this diagram, the square is of size 1x1, but in the actual problem, it's scaled up.From the coordinates, S is at (0, 1/3), so AS is 1/3 of the side length. Similarly, P is at (2/3,1), so AP is 2/3 of the side length. Wait, that seems contradictory because if AS is 1/3, then AP should be 1/3 as well if they're equal. But in the coordinates, AP is 2/3. Hmm, maybe the Asymptote code is just an example, and the actual problem has different proportions.So, perhaps I need to approach this algebraically. Let me denote the side length of the square as 's'. Let me denote the length from A to S as 'x', so AS = x. Since triangle APS is isosceles, AP must also be x. Similarly, the length from D to R is 'y', so DR = y, and since triangle DSR is isosceles, DS must also be y.Therefore, the remaining segment on side AB from P to B is s - x, and the remaining segment on side DA from S to D is s - y. But wait, since the triangles are cut off, the remaining figure is rectangle PQRS. So, the sides of the rectangle PQRS should be equal to the remaining segments on the square's sides.Therefore, the length PQ should be equal to the remaining segment on AB, which is s - x, and the width QR should be equal to the remaining segment on BC, which is s - y. But since PQRS is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so PS should be equal to QR, and PQ should be equal to SR.Wait, but PS is along side AD, which is from S to P. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the rectangle PQRS are parallel to the sides of the square, but shifted inward by the lengths x and y. So, the length of PQ would be s - 2x, and the width would be s - 2y, but I'm not sure. Let me try to sketch this mentally.If from each corner, we cut off an isosceles triangle with legs x and x, then the remaining side on each side of the square would be s - 2x. But since there are two different pairs of triangles, maybe one pair has legs x and the other has legs y.Wait, the problem says two pairs of identical isosceles triangles. So, perhaps two triangles have legs x and the other two have legs y. Therefore, the total area cut off would be 2*(1/2 x¬≤) + 2*(1/2 y¬≤) = x¬≤ + y¬≤. And this total area is given as 200 m¬≤, so x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200.Now, the remaining area is the area of the square minus 200, which is s¬≤ - 200. But the remaining figure is a rectangle PQRS. The area of PQRS is (s - 2x)(s - 2y) = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy. But this should also equal s¬≤ - 200. Therefore, s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy = s¬≤ - 200. Simplifying, we get -2s(x + y) + 4xy = -200. Dividing both sides by -2, we get s(x + y) - 2xy = 100.Hmm, that's one equation. But I also know that x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200. I need another equation to relate x and y. Maybe from the geometry of the rectangle.Wait, the sides of the rectangle PQRS are (s - 2x) and (s - 2y). But since PQRS is a rectangle, its sides must be perpendicular, so maybe there's a relationship between x and y from the slopes or something. Alternatively, perhaps the triangles are such that the remaining sides are proportional.Wait, maybe I can express s in terms of x and y. Since the triangles are cut off from each corner, the sides of the rectangle are s - 2x and s - 2y. But also, the triangles are isosceles, so the cuts are symmetrical. Therefore, maybe the remaining sides are related in a way that (s - 2x) and (s - 2y) are the sides of the rectangle, and the diagonal PR can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.But I need to find PR, which is the diagonal of the rectangle. So, PR¬≤ = (s - 2x)¬≤ + (s - 2y)¬≤. But I don't know s, x, or y yet. I only have x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200 and s(x + y) - 2xy = 100.Hmm, maybe I can express s in terms of x and y from the second equation. Let's rearrange it:s(x + y) = 100 + 2xySo, s = (100 + 2xy)/(x + y)Now, let's plug this into the expression for PR¬≤:PR¬≤ = (s - 2x)¬≤ + (s - 2y)¬≤Substitute s:PR¬≤ = [( (100 + 2xy)/(x + y) ) - 2x]¬≤ + [( (100 + 2xy)/(x + y) ) - 2y]¬≤Simplify each term:First term: ( (100 + 2xy)/(x + y) - 2x ) = (100 + 2xy - 2x(x + y))/(x + y) = (100 + 2xy - 2x¬≤ - 2xy)/(x + y) = (100 - 2x¬≤)/(x + y)Similarly, second term: ( (100 + 2xy)/(x + y) - 2y ) = (100 + 2xy - 2y(x + y))/(x + y) = (100 + 2xy - 2xy - 2y¬≤)/(x + y) = (100 - 2y¬≤)/(x + y)Therefore, PR¬≤ = [ (100 - 2x¬≤)/(x + y) ]¬≤ + [ (100 - 2y¬≤)/(x + y) ]¬≤Factor out 1/(x + y)¬≤:PR¬≤ = [ (100 - 2x¬≤)¬≤ + (100 - 2y¬≤)¬≤ ] / (x + y)¬≤This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach.Wait, earlier I had x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200. Maybe I can express PR in terms of x and y without involving s.Looking back, the diagonal PR of the rectangle PQRS is equal to the diagonal of the square minus something? Wait, no, because the rectangle is inside the square, but shifted.Alternatively, maybe PR is the same as the diagonal of the square, but that doesn't make sense because the square's diagonal is longer.Wait, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates suggest that PR is a diagonal of the rectangle, which is shorter than the square's diagonal. So, perhaps PR can be expressed in terms of x and y.Wait, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as a unit square, but scaled. So, in the actual problem, the square is larger. The Asymptote code shows that S is at (0, 1/3), P is at (2/3,1), Q is at (1, 2/3), and R is at (1/3,0). So, in this case, the side length is 1, and the distances are fractions of that.But in our problem, the total area cut off is 200 m¬≤, so the square must be larger. Let me see if I can find a relationship between x and y.From the Asymptote code, in the unit square, x would be 1/3 and y would be 2/3, because S is at (0,1/3) and P is at (2/3,1). So, AS = 1/3, AP = 2/3. But in our problem, the triangles are isosceles, so AS = AP, which would mean x = 2/3 and y = 1/3 in the unit square. But in our problem, the triangles are identical in pairs, so maybe x and y are related in a similar proportion.Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just an example, and the actual proportions are different. So, perhaps I need to consider that in the problem, the triangles are such that AS = AP = x and DR = DS = y, making the remaining sides of the rectangle s - 2x and s - 2y.But I also have x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200 from the total area cut off. And from the area of the rectangle, which is (s - 2x)(s - 2y) = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy = s¬≤ - 200.So, s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy = s¬≤ - 200Simplify: -2s(x + y) + 4xy = -200Divide both sides by -2: s(x + y) - 2xy = 100So, s(x + y) = 100 + 2xyNow, I need to find PR, which is the diagonal of the rectangle PQRS. The sides of the rectangle are (s - 2x) and (s - 2y), so PR¬≤ = (s - 2x)¬≤ + (s - 2y)¬≤Let me expand this:PR¬≤ = (s¬≤ - 4s x + 4x¬≤) + (s¬≤ - 4s y + 4y¬≤) = 2s¬≤ - 4s(x + y) + 4(x¬≤ + y¬≤)We know that x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200, so:PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 4s(x + y) + 4*200 = 2s¬≤ - 4s(x + y) + 800From earlier, we have s(x + y) = 100 + 2xySo, let's substitute s(x + y):PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 4*(100 + 2xy) + 800 = 2s¬≤ - 400 - 8xy + 800 = 2s¬≤ - 8xy + 400Hmm, still complicated. Maybe I can express s¬≤ in terms of x and y. From the area of the square, s¬≤ = area of square = area of rectangle + 200 = (s - 2x)(s - 2y) + 200But (s - 2x)(s - 2y) = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xySo, s¬≤ = (s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy) + 200Simplify: s¬≤ = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy + 200Subtract s¬≤: 0 = -2s(x + y) + 4xy + 200Which is the same as before: -2s(x + y) + 4xy = -200So, not helpful.Wait, maybe I can express s in terms of x and y from s(x + y) = 100 + 2xySo, s = (100 + 2xy)/(x + y)Then, s¬≤ = (100 + 2xy)¬≤ / (x + y)¬≤So, plug this into PR¬≤:PR¬≤ = 2*(100 + 2xy)¬≤ / (x + y)¬≤ - 8xy + 400This seems too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.Wait, perhaps the triangles are such that the remaining rectangle has sides proportional to x and y. Alternatively, maybe the diagonal PR is related to the square's diagonal.Wait, the square's diagonal is s‚àö2. The rectangle's diagonal PR is shorter. But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the triangles are similar or something. Wait, the triangles are isosceles, so their legs are equal, but not necessarily similar to each other.Wait, let me think about the coordinates again. In the Asymptote code, the square is unit length, and the points are at 1/3 and 2/3. So, maybe in our problem, the proportions are similar, but scaled up.If in the unit square, the area cut off is 4*(1/2)*(1/3)^2 + 4*(1/2)*(2/3)^2? Wait, no, in the unit square, the area cut off would be 4*(1/2)*(1/3)^2 + 4*(1/2)*(2/3)^2? Wait, no, actually, in the Asymptote code, there are four triangles, each with base and height 1/3 or 2/3.Wait, in the unit square, the area cut off would be 4*(1/2)*(1/3)*(1/3) + 4*(1/2)*(2/3)*(2/3)? Wait, no, actually, each triangle is either (1/3,1/3) or (2/3,2/3). Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, the triangles are:- tri1: a--p--s--cycle: a is (0,1), p is (2/3,1), s is (0,1/3). So, this triangle has base along the top from (0,1) to (2/3,1), and down to (0,1/3). So, it's a right triangle with legs 2/3 and 2/3? Wait, no, from (0,1) to (2/3,1) is 2/3, and from (0,1) to (0,1/3) is 2/3. So, yes, it's a right isosceles triangle with legs 2/3. So, area is (1/2)*(2/3)^2 = (1/2)*(4/9) = 2/9.Similarly, tri2: p--q--b--cycle: p is (2/3,1), q is (1,2/3), b is (1,1). So, this is a right isosceles triangle with legs 1/3. Area is (1/2)*(1/3)^2 = 1/18.Wait, but in the Asymptote code, all four triangles are filled, so total area cut off is 2*(2/9) + 2*(1/18) = 4/9 + 1/9 = 5/9. But in our problem, the total area cut off is 200 m¬≤. So, if in the unit square, the area cut off is 5/9, then in our problem, the scaling factor squared times 5/9 equals 200.Let me denote the scaling factor as k. So, (k^2)*(5/9) = 200. Therefore, k^2 = 200*(9/5) = 360. So, k = sqrt(360) = 6*sqrt(10). Therefore, the side length of the square is k*1 = 6‚àö10 meters.Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the triangles are not all the same. Two are larger (area 2/9 each) and two are smaller (area 1/18 each). So, in our problem, the total area cut off is 200, which corresponds to 5/9 in the unit square. Therefore, scaling factor squared is 200/(5/9) = 200*(9/5) = 360, so scaling factor is sqrt(360) = 6‚àö10.Therefore, the side length of the square is 6‚àö10 meters.Now, the diagonal PR of the rectangle PQRS. In the unit square, the rectangle PQRS has coordinates p = (2/3,1), q = (1,2/3), r = (1/3,0), s = (0,1/3). So, the rectangle is a parallelogram, but in the unit square, it's actually a rectangle because the sides are perpendicular.Wait, in the unit square, the rectangle PQRS has sides from (2/3,1) to (1,2/3) to (1/3,0) to (0,1/3) to (2/3,1). So, the length of PQ is the distance between (2/3,1) and (1,2/3). Let's calculate that.Distance PQ: sqrt[(1 - 2/3)^2 + (2/3 - 1)^2] = sqrt[(1/3)^2 + (-1/3)^2] = sqrt(1/9 + 1/9) = sqrt(2/9) = ‚àö2/3.Similarly, the length QR is the distance between (1,2/3) and (1/3,0). Distance QR: sqrt[(1/3 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2/3)^2] = sqrt[(-2/3)^2 + (-2/3)^2] = sqrt(4/9 + 4/9) = sqrt(8/9) = 2‚àö2/3.Wait, so in the unit square, the sides of the rectangle are ‚àö2/3 and 2‚àö2/3. Therefore, the diagonal PR would be sqrt[(‚àö2/3)^2 + (2‚àö2/3)^2] = sqrt[(2/9) + (8/9)] = sqrt(10/9) = ‚àö10/3.But in our problem, the scaling factor is 6‚àö10, so the diagonal PR would be (‚àö10/3)*(6‚àö10) = (‚àö10 * 6‚àö10)/3 = (6*10)/3 = 60/3 = 20 meters.Wait, that makes sense! So, the diagonal PR is 20 meters.Alternatively, without relying on the Asymptote code's proportions, I could have approached it algebraically. Let me try that again.Given that the total area cut off is 200 m¬≤, which is x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200. The diagonal PR of the rectangle is sqrt[(s - 2x)^2 + (s - 2y)^2]. But from earlier, we have s(x + y) = 100 + 2xy.But I also know that (s - 2x) and (s - 2y) are the sides of the rectangle. Let me denote a = s - 2x and b = s - 2y. Then, the area of the rectangle is a*b = s¬≤ - 200.Also, from the Pythagorean theorem, PR¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤.But I need to express a and b in terms of x and y. Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.Wait, since the triangles are isosceles, the sides a and b are related to x and y. Specifically, a = s - 2x and b = s - 2y.But I also have s(x + y) = 100 + 2xy.Let me try to express a and b in terms of s, x, and y:a = s - 2xb = s - 2ySo, a + b = 2s - 2x - 2y = 2(s - x - y)But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, let's consider that PR¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ = (s - 2x)¬≤ + (s - 2y)¬≤Expanding:= s¬≤ - 4s x + 4x¬≤ + s¬≤ - 4s y + 4y¬≤= 2s¬≤ - 4s(x + y) + 4(x¬≤ + y¬≤)We know x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200, so:PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 4s(x + y) + 800From earlier, s(x + y) = 100 + 2xySo, let's substitute:PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 4*(100 + 2xy) + 800= 2s¬≤ - 400 - 8xy + 800= 2s¬≤ - 8xy + 400Now, I need to express s¬≤ in terms of x and y. From the area of the square:s¬≤ = area of square = area of rectangle + 200 = a*b + 200But a*b = (s - 2x)(s - 2y) = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xySo, s¬≤ = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy + 200Simplify: 0 = -2s(x + y) + 4xy + 200Which is the same as before: s(x + y) = 100 + 2xySo, s = (100 + 2xy)/(x + y)Therefore, s¬≤ = (100 + 2xy)¬≤ / (x + y)¬≤Plugging this into PR¬≤:PR¬≤ = 2*(100 + 2xy)¬≤ / (x + y)¬≤ - 8xy + 400This seems too complex. Maybe there's a different approach.Wait, perhaps I can consider that the diagonal PR is related to the square's diagonal. The square's diagonal is s‚àö2, and the rectangle's diagonal is PR. But I don't see a direct relationship.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the area of the rectangle is s¬≤ - 200, and its sides are a and b, so a*b = s¬≤ - 200. Also, PR¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤.But I also have a = s - 2x and b = s - 2y. So, maybe I can express a and b in terms of s, x, and y, and then find a relationship.Wait, from a = s - 2x and b = s - 2y, we can write x = (s - a)/2 and y = (s - b)/2.Substituting into x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200:[(s - a)/2]^2 + [(s - b)/2]^2 = 200Expanding:(s¬≤ - 2s a + a¬≤)/4 + (s¬≤ - 2s b + b¬≤)/4 = 200Combine terms:(2s¬≤ - 2s(a + b) + a¬≤ + b¬≤)/4 = 200Multiply both sides by 4:2s¬≤ - 2s(a + b) + a¬≤ + b¬≤ = 800But a¬≤ + b¬≤ = PR¬≤, and a*b = s¬≤ - 200So, 2s¬≤ - 2s(a + b) + PR¬≤ = 800But I still have too many variables.Wait, maybe I can express a + b in terms of s. From a = s - 2x and b = s - 2y, a + b = 2s - 2(x + y). From earlier, s(x + y) = 100 + 2xy, so x + y = (100 + 2xy)/sTherefore, a + b = 2s - 2*(100 + 2xy)/s = 2s - (200 + 4xy)/sSo, plugging back into the equation:2s¬≤ - 2s*(2s - (200 + 4xy)/s) + PR¬≤ = 800Simplify:2s¬≤ - 4s¬≤ + (200 + 4xy) + PR¬≤ = 800-2s¬≤ + 200 + 4xy + PR¬≤ = 800So, PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 4xy + 600But earlier, we had PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 8xy + 400Wait, this is inconsistent. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.Let me double-check:From 2s¬≤ - 2s(a + b) + PR¬≤ = 800And a + b = 2s - (200 + 4xy)/sSo,2s¬≤ - 2s*(2s - (200 + 4xy)/s) + PR¬≤ = 800= 2s¬≤ - 4s¬≤ + 2*(200 + 4xy) + PR¬≤ = 800= -2s¬≤ + 400 + 8xy + PR¬≤ = 800Therefore, PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 8xy + 400Which matches the earlier expression.So, PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 8xy + 400But I still need to find s and xy.From s(x + y) = 100 + 2xyAnd x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200Let me denote u = x + y and v = xyThen, we have:u = x + yv = xyFrom x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 200, we know that (x + y)¬≤ = x¬≤ + 2xy + y¬≤ = 200 + 2vSo, u¬≤ = 200 + 2vFrom s*u = 100 + 2vSo, s = (100 + 2v)/uAlso, from the area of the square, s¬≤ = a*b + 200 = (s - 2x)(s - 2y) + 200But (s - 2x)(s - 2y) = s¬≤ - 2s(x + y) + 4xy = s¬≤ - 2s u + 4vSo, s¬≤ = s¬≤ - 2s u + 4v + 200Simplify: 0 = -2s u + 4v + 200Which is the same as before: 2s u = 4v + 200 => s u = 2v + 100But from earlier, s u = 100 + 2vSo, both equations are consistent.Now, let's express PR¬≤ in terms of u and v:PR¬≤ = 2s¬≤ - 8v + 400But s = (100 + 2v)/uSo, s¬≤ = (100 + 2v)¬≤ / u¬≤Therefore,PR¬≤ = 2*(100 + 2v)¬≤ / u¬≤ - 8v + 400But u¬≤ = 200 + 2vSo, PR¬≤ = 2*(100 + 2v)¬≤ / (200 + 2v) - 8v + 400Simplify denominator: 200 + 2v = 2(100 + v)So,PR¬≤ = 2*(100 + 2v)¬≤ / [2(100 + v)] - 8v + 400= (100 + 2v)¬≤ / (100 + v) - 8v + 400Let me compute (100 + 2v)¬≤:= 10000 + 400v + 4v¬≤So,PR¬≤ = (10000 + 400v + 4v¬≤)/(100 + v) - 8v + 400Let me perform polynomial division on (10000 + 400v + 4v¬≤) divided by (100 + v):Divide 4v¬≤ + 400v + 10000 by v + 100.Using polynomial long division:v + 100 ) 4v¬≤ + 400v + 10000First term: 4v¬≤ / v = 4vMultiply (v + 100) by 4v: 4v¬≤ + 400vSubtract: (4v¬≤ + 400v) - (4v¬≤ + 400v) = 0Bring down the 10000: 0 + 10000Now, divide 10000 by (v + 100). Since 10000 = 100*(v + 100) - 100v + 10000, but that's not helpful. Wait, actually, 10000 = 100*100, so if v + 100 = 100, then v = 0, but that's not necessarily the case.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try synthetic division.Alternatively, factor the numerator:4v¬≤ + 400v + 10000 = 4(v¬≤ + 100v + 2500) = 4(v + 50)^2Wait, (v + 50)^2 = v¬≤ + 100v + 2500, so yes.So, numerator is 4(v + 50)^2Denominator is (v + 100)So, PR¬≤ = [4(v + 50)^2]/(v + 100) - 8v + 400Let me write this as:PR¬≤ = 4(v + 50)^2/(v + 100) - 8v + 400Let me simplify 4(v + 50)^2/(v + 100):= 4(v¬≤ + 100v + 2500)/(v + 100)= 4[(v + 100)(v - 0) + 2500]/(v + 100)Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, perform polynomial division:Divide (v + 50)^2 by (v + 100):(v + 50)^2 = v¬≤ + 100v + 2500Divide by v + 100:= (v + 100)(v - 0) + 2500Wait, no, let me do it properly.Divide v¬≤ + 100v + 2500 by v + 100.First term: v¬≤ / v = vMultiply (v + 100) by v: v¬≤ + 100vSubtract: (v¬≤ + 100v) - (v¬≤ + 100v) = 0Bring down the 2500: 0 + 2500So, the division gives v with a remainder of 2500.Therefore,(v + 50)^2 = (v + 100)*v + 2500So,4(v + 50)^2/(v + 100) = 4[v + 2500/(v + 100)]Therefore,PR¬≤ = 4v + 10000/(v + 100) - 8v + 400Simplify:= -4v + 10000/(v + 100) + 400Hmm, still complicated. Maybe I need to find the value of v.From earlier, u¬≤ = 200 + 2vAnd s u = 100 + 2vBut s = (100 + 2v)/uSo, s = (100 + 2v)/uBut I don't know u or v.Wait, maybe I can express v in terms of u.From u¬≤ = 200 + 2v => v = (u¬≤ - 200)/2So, s = (100 + 2*(u¬≤ - 200)/2)/u = (100 + u¬≤ - 200)/u = (u¬≤ - 100)/uSo, s = (u¬≤ - 100)/uNow, let's plug v = (u¬≤ - 200)/2 into PR¬≤:PR¬≤ = -4v + 10000/(v + 100) + 400= -4*(u¬≤ - 200)/2 + 10000/[(u¬≤ - 200)/2 + 100] + 400Simplify:= -2(u¬≤ - 200) + 10000/[ (u¬≤ - 200 + 200)/2 ] + 400= -2u¬≤ + 400 + 10000/[u¬≤/2] + 400= -2u¬≤ + 400 + (10000*2)/u¬≤ + 400= -2u¬≤ + 400 + 20000/u¬≤ + 400= -2u¬≤ + 800 + 20000/u¬≤So, PR¬≤ = -2u¬≤ + 800 + 20000/u¬≤This is a function in terms of u¬≤. Let me denote w = u¬≤, then:PR¬≤ = -2w + 800 + 20000/wTo find the minimum or something? Wait, but I don't know if PR has a minimum. Alternatively, maybe I can find w such that this expression is valid.But I'm stuck here. Maybe there's a different approach.Wait, going back to the Asymptote code, in the unit square, the diagonal PR is ‚àö10/3, and scaling it by 6‚àö10 gives 20 meters. So, maybe the answer is 20 meters.Alternatively, let me consider that in the unit square, the diagonal PR is ‚àö10/3, and the area cut off is 5/9. So, scaling factor k satisfies (k)^2*(5/9) = 200 => k¬≤ = 200*(9/5) = 360 => k = 6‚àö10. Therefore, the diagonal PR is (‚àö10/3)*k = (‚àö10/3)*(6‚àö10) = (6*10)/3 = 20 meters.Yes, that makes sense. So, the length of PR is 20 meters."},{"question":"A total of 24 teams participate in a single-elimination tournament.

It is known that the number B is coprime with 18 and B > 22222222. Find the largest and smallest among the numbers A that satisfy these conditions. (Two natural numbers are called coprime if they have no common divisors other than one).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a nine-digit number A, which is formed by taking another number B, moving its last digit to the front. The catch is that B has to be coprime with 18, meaning it can't share any common factors with 18 except for 1. Also, B has to be greater than 222,222,222. I need to find the largest and smallest possible A that satisfy these conditions.First, let me break down what it means for B to be coprime with 18. Since 18 is 2 times 3 squared, B must not be divisible by 2 or 3. So, B has to be an odd number (to not be divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits shouldn't be a multiple of 3 (to not be divisible by 3). That gives me some constraints on what B can be.Now, A is formed by moving the last digit of B to the front. Let me denote the last digit of B as b. So, if B is a nine-digit number, say B = b1b2b3b4b5b6b7b8b9, then A would be b9b1b2b3b4b5b6b7b8. Mathematically, I can express A in terms of B. Let's see, if B is a nine-digit number, then moving the last digit to the front would involve taking the last digit, which is b, multiplying it by 10^8 to shift it to the front, and then adding the remaining part of B without the last digit. So, A = b * 10^8 + (B - b)/10. That makes sense because (B - b)/10 would remove the last digit and shift everything left by one place. So, A is constructed by placing b in the first position and then appending the rest of B without its last digit.Given that, I need to find B such that A is nine digits, which it already is because B is nine digits. Also, B has to be greater than 222,222,222, so B is at least 222,222,223, but since it's a nine-digit number, it's up to 999,999,999.Now, since A is formed by moving the last digit of B to the front, the value of A will depend heavily on what that last digit is. To maximize A, I want the first digit (which is the last digit of B) to be as large as possible. Similarly, to minimize A, I want that first digit to be as small as possible.So, for the largest A, the last digit of B should be 9. For the smallest A, the last digit of B should be 1, because 0 isn't allowed since B is a nine-digit number and moving 0 to the front would make it an eight-digit number, which isn't allowed.But wait, B can't end with 0 because then A would start with 0, making it an eight-digit number, which isn't allowed. So, the last digit of B has to be between 1 and 9, but also, since B must be coprime with 18, it can't be even or a multiple of 3.So, the last digit of B can't be 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 because those would make B even or a multiple of 5, but wait, 5 isn't a factor of 18, so actually, only constraints are not divisible by 2 or 3. So, the last digit can't be even (to avoid divisibility by 2) and can't be 3, 6, or 9 (to avoid divisibility by 3). So, the last digit can only be 1, 5, or 7.Wait, hold on, 5 is a problem because if B ends with 5, then B is divisible by 5, but 5 isn't a factor of 18, so actually, B can end with 5 because 5 and 18 are coprime. Wait, no, 5 and 18 are coprime, but B ending with 5 would make it divisible by 5, but since 5 isn't a factor of 18, it's still coprime. So, actually, the last digit can be 1, 5, or 7 because those are the digits that are neither even nor multiples of 3.Wait, 5 is a multiple of 5, but since 5 isn't a factor of 18, it's still coprime. So, actually, the last digit can be 1, 5, or 7 because those are the digits that are not even and not multiples of 3. So, for the largest A, we can't have 9 as the last digit because 9 is a multiple of 3, so B can't end with 9. Similarly, 7 is allowed because 7 isn't a multiple of 3 or 2.Wait, so let me correct that. The last digit of B can't be even (to avoid divisibility by 2) and can't be 3, 6, or 9 (to avoid divisibility by 3). So, the possible last digits are 1, 5, or 7.Therefore, to maximize A, we should choose the largest possible last digit, which is 7. To minimize A, we should choose the smallest possible last digit, which is 1.Wait, but 5 is also an option. So, 5 is larger than 1 but smaller than 7. So, for the largest A, 7 is better, and for the smallest A, 1 is better.So, moving on, let's try to construct B for both cases.First, for the largest A:We want B to end with 7, and B should be as large as possible, but also, when we move the last digit to the front, A should be as large as possible. So, B should be as large as possible, ending with 7, and also, the rest of the digits should be as large as possible.But wait, actually, A is determined by moving the last digit to the front, so to maximize A, we need the first digit of A to be as large as possible, which is the last digit of B. So, the last digit of B should be 7, and the rest of B should be as large as possible.But B has to be greater than 222,222,222, so the smallest B is 222,222,223, but since we're looking for the largest A, we want the largest possible B, which is 999,999,997, but we have to check if it's coprime with 18.Wait, 999,999,997 ends with 7, which is good because it's not even and not a multiple of 3. Let's check the sum of its digits: 9*8 + 7 = 72 + 7 = 79. 79 is not divisible by 3, so 999,999,997 is coprime with 18. So, that's a valid B.So, moving the last digit 7 to the front, A would be 799999999. Wait, but let me verify that.Wait, B is 999,999,997. Moving the last digit 7 to the front would give A = 7 followed by the first eight digits of B, which are 99999999. So, A = 799,999,999.But wait, is that correct? Let me think. If B is 999,999,997, then moving the last digit 7 to the front would give A = 7 followed by 99,999,999, which is 799,999,999. Yes, that's correct.But wait, is 799,999,999 the largest possible A? Let me think. If B is 999,999,997, then A is 799,999,999. But what if B is 999,999,987? Then A would be 799,999,989, which is smaller. So, yes, 799,999,999 is the largest A when B is 999,999,997.But wait, is there a larger B that ends with 7? The maximum B is 999,999,997, so that's the largest possible B ending with 7. So, A would be 799,999,999.Wait, but hold on, 799,999,999 is less than 999,999,999, but since we're moving the last digit to the front, it's the maximum possible A given the constraints.Wait, but let me think again. If B is 999,999,997, then A is 799,999,999. But if B is 999,999,987, A is 799,999,989, which is smaller. So, yes, 799,999,999 is the largest A.But wait, is there a way to get a larger A? For example, if B ends with 9, but B can't end with 9 because 9 is a multiple of 3, so B can't end with 9. So, the next best is 7.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999.Wait, but let me check if 799,999,999 is indeed formed by moving the last digit of B to the front. B is 999,999,997, moving the last digit 7 to the front gives 799,999,999. Yes, that's correct.Now, for the smallest A, we want the last digit of B to be 1, which is the smallest possible digit that is coprime with 18. So, B should end with 1, and the rest of the digits should be as small as possible, but B has to be greater than 222,222,222.So, the smallest possible B ending with 1 and greater than 222,222,222 would be 222,222,221, but wait, that's less than 222,222,222. So, the next one is 222,222,231. But let's check if that's coprime with 18.222,222,231 ends with 1, which is good. The sum of its digits: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+3+1 = 18. Oh, wait, that's divisible by 3, so 222,222,231 is divisible by 3, so it's not coprime with 18. So, we need to find the next number ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and whose digits sum to a number not divisible by 3.So, starting from 222,222,221, which is less than 222,222,222, the next candidate is 222,222,231, which we saw is divisible by 3. Then 222,222,241. Let's check the sum of digits: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+4+1 = 19. 19 is not divisible by 3, so 222,222,241 is coprime with 18.So, B = 222,222,241. Moving the last digit 1 to the front gives A = 122,222,241. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.B is 222,222,241. Moving the last digit 1 to the front would give A = 1 followed by the first eight digits of B, which are 22,222,241. So, A = 122,222,241.But wait, is there a smaller A? Let's see. If B is 222,222,241, then A is 122,222,241. If B is 222,222,251, which is also coprime with 18, the sum of digits is 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+5+1=20, which is not divisible by 3, so it's coprime. Then A would be 122,222,251, which is larger than 122,222,241. So, 122,222,241 is smaller.Wait, but is 222,222,241 the smallest B ending with 1 greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18? Let's check the next one after 222,222,241, which is 222,222,251, which we saw is larger. So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18.Therefore, the smallest A is 122,222,241.Wait, but let me double-check. If B is 222,222,241, moving the last digit 1 to the front gives A = 122,222,241. Is there a smaller B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18? Let's see.The number after 222,222,222 is 222,222,223, which is odd, but ends with 3, which is a multiple of 3, so not coprime. Then 222,222,225, ends with 5, which is coprime, but we're looking for ending with 1. So, the next number ending with 1 after 222,222,222 is 222,222,231, which we saw is divisible by 3. Then 222,222,241, which is coprime. So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18.Therefore, the smallest A is 122,222,241.Wait, but let me think again. If B is 222,222,241, then A is 122,222,241. But if B is 222,222,251, A is 122,222,251, which is larger. So, 122,222,241 is indeed the smallest A.But wait, is there a way to get a smaller A? For example, if B is 222,222,221, which is less than 222,222,222, so it's invalid. The next is 222,222,231, which is invalid because it's divisible by 3. Then 222,222,241 is the first valid B, so A is 122,222,241.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,241.Wait, but let me check if there's a larger A possible. For example, if B is 999,999,987, which ends with 7, and is coprime with 18. Then A would be 799,999,989, which is smaller than 799,999,999. So, yes, 799,999,999 is larger.Similarly, if B is 999,999,977, A is 799,999,979, which is smaller. So, 799,999,999 is indeed the largest A.Wait, but let me think about the structure of B. If B is 999,999,997, then A is 799,999,999. But what if B is 999,999,999? Wait, no, because B must end with 7, 1, or 5. 999,999,999 ends with 9, which is invalid because it's a multiple of 3. So, the largest B ending with 7 is 999,999,997, which gives A as 799,999,999.Similarly, for the smallest A, B is 222,222,241, giving A as 122,222,241.Wait, but let me check if 222,222,241 is indeed the smallest B ending with 1 greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18. Let's see:- 222,222,221: less than 222,222,222, invalid.- 222,222,231: sum of digits is 18, divisible by 3, invalid.- 222,222,241: sum of digits is 19, not divisible by 3, valid.So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B ending with 1 that meets the criteria.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,241.But wait, let me think again about the largest A. If B is 999,999,997, then A is 799,999,999. But what if B is 999,999,987? Then A is 799,999,989, which is smaller. So, 799,999,999 is indeed larger.Wait, but is there a way to get a larger A? For example, if B is 999,999,977, A is 799,999,979, which is smaller. So, no, 799,999,999 is the largest.Similarly, for the smallest A, 122,222,241 is the smallest possible.Wait, but let me think about the structure of B again. If B is 222,222,241, moving the last digit 1 to the front gives A = 122,222,241. But what if B is 222,222,251? Then A is 122,222,251, which is larger. So, 122,222,241 is indeed the smallest.Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18. The next number after 222,222,222 ending with 1 is 222,222,231, which is invalid because it's divisible by 3. Then 222,222,241 is the next, which is valid. So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B, giving A as 122,222,241.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,241.Wait, but let me think about the last digit of B again. Since B must end with 1, 5, or 7, and we've considered 1 and 7 for the smallest and largest A, respectively. What about 5? For example, if B ends with 5, could that give a larger or smaller A?For the largest A, if B ends with 5, the first digit of A would be 5, which is less than 7, so 7 is better. For the smallest A, if B ends with 5, the first digit of A would be 5, which is larger than 1, so 1 is better. Therefore, 7 and 1 are the optimal choices for the last digit of B to maximize and minimize A, respectively.So, to summarize:- Largest A: B ends with 7, B is as large as possible, which is 999,999,997, giving A = 799,999,999.- Smallest A: B ends with 1, B is the smallest possible greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18, which is 222,222,241, giving A = 122,222,241.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,241.Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for A.For B = 999,999,997:A = 7 * 10^8 + (999,999,997 - 7)/10 = 700,000,000 + (999,999,990)/10 = 700,000,000 + 99,999,999 = 799,999,999. Correct.For B = 222,222,241:A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + (222,222,240)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.If B = 222,222,241, then A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + (222,222,240)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.Wait, so earlier I thought A was 122,222,241, but actually, it's 122,222,224. That's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong?Ah, I see. When moving the last digit to the front, it's not just appending the rest of B without the last digit. It's actually taking the last digit and placing it in the first position, then the rest follow. So, if B is 222,222,241, moving the last digit 1 to the front gives A = 1 followed by 22,222,241, which is 122,222,241. But according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. That's conflicting.Wait, no, let me clarify. The formula is A = b * 10^8 + (B - b)/10. So, for B = 222,222,241, b = 1.So, A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 222,222,240 / 10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.But when I think about it as moving the last digit to the front, it should be 1 followed by the first eight digits of B, which are 22,222,241. So, A should be 122,222,241. But according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. That's a problem.Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me think again.If B is a nine-digit number, say B = D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9, then moving the last digit D9 to the front gives A = D9 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8.So, in terms of value, A = D9 * 10^8 + (B - D9)/10.Yes, that's correct. So, for B = 222,222,241, which is 222,222,241, D9 = 1, so A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.But when I think about it as moving the last digit to the front, I would expect A to be 122,222,241, but according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. So, which one is correct?Wait, let's take a smaller example to test. Let's say B = 123456789. Moving the last digit 9 to the front gives A = 912345678.Using the formula: A = 9 * 10^8 + (123,456,789 - 9)/10 = 900,000,000 + 12,345,678 = 912,345,678. Correct.Similarly, if B = 222,222,241, moving the last digit 1 to the front should give A = 122,222,241. But according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. That's inconsistent.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express B.If B is a nine-digit number, B = 10 * C + d, where C is the first eight digits and d is the last digit. Then, moving the last digit to the front gives A = d * 10^8 + C.So, A = d * 10^8 + (B - d)/10.Yes, that's correct. So, for B = 222,222,241, which is 222,222,241, d = 1, so A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.But when I think about it as moving the last digit to the front, it should be 122,222,241. So, why is there a discrepancy?Wait, no, actually, when you move the last digit to the front, you're not just adding the last digit to the front of the remaining digits. You're shifting the entire number. So, B = 222,222,241 is 222,222,241. Moving the last digit 1 to the front gives A = 122,222,241, which is 1 followed by 22,222,241.But according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. So, which one is correct?Wait, let's compute both:- A as per moving the last digit: 122,222,241.- A as per the formula: 122,222,224.They are different. So, which one is correct?Wait, let's compute A using the formula:A = d * 10^8 + (B - d)/10 = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.But when I move the last digit 1 to the front, I get 122,222,241, which is different.Wait, this suggests that the formula is not correctly capturing the movement of the last digit to the front. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of B.Wait, let me think again. If B is 222,222,241, which is 222,222,241, then the first eight digits are 22,222,241, and the last digit is 1. So, moving the last digit to the front should give A = 1 followed by 22,222,241, which is 122,222,241.But according to the formula, it's 122,222,224. So, why the difference?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express B as:B = D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9.Then, A = D9 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8.So, in terms of value, A = D9 * 10^8 + D1 * 10^7 + D2 * 10^6 + ... + D8 * 10^0.But B = D1 * 10^8 + D2 * 10^7 + ... + D9 * 10^0.So, to express A in terms of B, we have:A = D9 * 10^8 + (B - D9)/10.Yes, that's correct.So, for B = 222,222,241, D9 = 1, so A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.But when I think about it as moving the last digit to the front, I get 122,222,241. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write B as 222,222,241, which is 222,222,241. So, the digits are:D1 = 2, D2 = 2, D3 = 2, D4 = 2, D5 = 2, D6 = 2, D7 = 2, D8 = 4, D9 = 1.So, moving D9 to the front gives A = 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4, which is 122,222,224.Wait, that's 122,222,224, not 122,222,241. So, I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 122,222,241. It's actually 122,222,224.So, the formula is correct. Therefore, the smallest A is 122,222,224.Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I need to correct that.Therefore, the smallest A is 122,222,224.Similarly, for the largest A, B = 999,999,997, moving the last digit 7 to the front gives A = 799,999,999.Wait, let me verify that:B = 999,999,997, which is 999,999,997.Digits: D1=9, D2=9, D3=9, D4=9, D5=9, D6=9, D7=9, D8=9, D9=7.Moving D9=7 to the front gives A = 7 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9, which is 799,999,999. Correct.So, the largest A is 799,999,999.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,224.Wait, but let me check if 122,222,224 is indeed the smallest A. Is there a smaller B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18?We had B = 222,222,241, which gives A = 122,222,224. Is there a smaller B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18?The next number after 222,222,222 ending with 1 is 222,222,231, which is divisible by 3, so invalid. Then 222,222,241, which is valid, giving A = 122,222,224. The next one is 222,222,251, which is also valid, giving A = 122,222,251, which is larger. So, 122,222,224 is indeed the smallest A.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,224.Wait, but let me think again about the smallest A. If B is 222,222,241, then A is 122,222,224. But what if B is 222,222,251, which is also valid, giving A = 122,222,251, which is larger. So, 122,222,224 is the smallest.But wait, is there a B ending with 1 that is smaller than 222,222,241 but still greater than 222,222,222? For example, 222,222,231 is invalid, 222,222,241 is the next valid one. So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B ending with 1 that is greater than 222,222,222 and coprime with 18.Therefore, the smallest A is 122,222,224.Wait, but let me check the sum of digits for B = 222,222,241. Sum is 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+4+1 = 19, which is not divisible by 3, so it's coprime with 18. Correct.Similarly, for B = 999,999,997, sum of digits is 9*8 + 7 = 72 + 7 = 79, which is not divisible by 3, so it's coprime with 18. Correct.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,224.Wait, but let me think about the structure of B again. If B is 222,222,241, then A is 122,222,224. But if B is 222,222,221, which is less than 222,222,222, it's invalid. So, yes, 222,222,241 is the smallest B.Therefore, the final answers are:Largest A: 799,999,999Smallest A: 122,222,224But wait, let me check the formula again for B = 222,222,241:A = 1 * 10^8 + (222,222,241 - 1)/10 = 100,000,000 + 22,222,224 = 122,222,224.Yes, correct.And for B = 999,999,997:A = 7 * 10^8 + (999,999,997 - 7)/10 = 700,000,000 + 99,999,999 = 799,999,999.Yes, correct.Therefore, the largest A is 799,999,999 and the smallest A is 122,222,224."},{"question":"Let [g(x) =begin{cases}3x + 4 &text{if } x < 0, x^2 + 2x + 1 &text{if } x geq 0.end{cases}] Find g(-3).","answer":"To find ( g(-3) ), I first need to determine which part of the piecewise function to use.

Solve in the set of the positive integers the equation  x^n + y^n = 3^m .","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (x^n + y^n = 3^m), where (m) and (n) are positive integers greater than or equal to 2. I need to find all positive integer solutions for (x), (y), (m), and (n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that (3^m) is a power of 3, which means it's an odd number because any power of 3 is odd. Now, looking at the left side of the equation, (x^n + y^n), since the sum is odd, one of (x^n) or (y^n) must be even, and the other must be odd. Because if both were even or both were odd, their sum would be even or even, respectively, which contradicts the fact that (3^m) is odd.So, without loss of generality, let's assume (x) is even and (y) is odd. Or maybe it's the other way around? Actually, it doesn't matter because the equation is symmetric in (x) and (y). So, I can just assume (x) is even and (y) is odd.Now, since (x) is even, (x^n) is also even, and (y^n) is odd. So, their sum is odd, which matches (3^m). That makes sense.Next, I should consider the possible values of (n). Since (n geq 2), it can be 2, 3, 4, etc. Maybe I can check for small values of (n) first and see if I can find a pattern or some solutions.Let's start with (n = 2). Then the equation becomes (x^2 + y^2 = 3^m). I need to find positive integers (x), (y), and (m) such that this holds.I know that squares modulo 3 are either 0 or 1 because:- (0^2 equiv 0 pmod{3})- (1^2 equiv 1 pmod{3})- (2^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3})So, (x^2) and (y^2) can each be either 0 or 1 modulo 3. Therefore, their sum can be:- 0 + 0 = 0- 0 + 1 = 1- 1 + 0 = 1- 1 + 1 = 2But (3^m equiv 0 pmod{3}), so the sum (x^2 + y^2) must be congruent to 0 modulo 3. From the above, the only way this can happen is if both (x^2) and (y^2) are congruent to 0 modulo 3. That means both (x) and (y) must be multiples of 3.Let me write (x = 3a) and (y = 3b) where (a) and (b) are positive integers. Substituting back into the equation:[(3a)^2 + (3b)^2 = 3^m 9a^2 + 9b^2 = 3^m 9(a^2 + b^2) = 3^m 3^2(a^2 + b^2) = 3^m]So, (a^2 + b^2 = 3^{m - 2}). Now, this is similar to the original equation but with smaller exponents. Let's denote (k = m - 2), so the equation becomes (a^2 + b^2 = 3^k).But wait, this is the same form as before. So, unless (k = 0), which would mean (m = 2), we can keep factoring out 3s. If (k = 0), then (a^2 + b^2 = 1). The only positive integer solutions for this are (a = 1) and (b = 0) or vice versa, but (b) must be positive, so this isn't possible. Therefore, there are no solutions when (n = 2).Hmm, that's interesting. So, for (n = 2), there are no solutions. Let me try (n = 3).So, the equation becomes (x^3 + y^3 = 3^m). I need to find positive integers (x), (y), and (m) such that this holds.I remember that (x^3 + y^3) can be factored as ((x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)). So, maybe I can use this factorization.Let me write:[x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = 3^m]Since (3^m) is a power of 3, both factors (x + y) and (x^2 - xy + y^2) must also be powers of 3. Let me denote:[x + y = 3^k x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3^l]where (k + l = m).Now, since (x) and (y) are positive integers, (k) and (l) must be at least 1. Also, (k < m) because (x + y) is a proper divisor of (3^m).Let me try small values of (k). Let's start with (k = 1):If (k = 1), then (x + y = 3). The possible positive integer solutions for (x) and (y) are:- (x = 1), (y = 2)- (x = 2), (y = 1)Let me check each case.First, (x = 1), (y = 2):Compute (x^2 - xy + y^2):[1^2 - (1)(2) + 2^2 = 1 - 2 + 4 = 3]So, (x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3), which is (3^1). Therefore, (l = 1), and (m = k + l = 1 + 1 = 2).So, we have a solution: (x = 1), (y = 2), (n = 3), (m = 2).Similarly, for (x = 2), (y = 1), the computation is the same:[2^2 - (2)(1) + 1^2 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3]So, another solution: (x = 2), (y = 1), (n = 3), (m = 2).Now, let's try (k = 2):If (k = 2), then (x + y = 9). Let's see if there are positive integers (x) and (y) such that (x + y = 9) and (x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3^{m - 2}).Let me denote (s = x + y = 9) and (p = xy). Then, (x^2 - xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 3xy = s^2 - 3p = 81 - 3p).This must equal (3^{m - 2}). So,[81 - 3p = 3^{m - 2} 3p = 81 - 3^{m - 2} p = frac{81 - 3^{m - 2}}{3} = 27 - 3^{m - 3}]Since (p = xy) must be a positive integer, (27 - 3^{m - 3}) must be positive. Therefore,[27 - 3^{m - 3} > 0 3^{m - 3} < 27 3^{m - 3} < 3^3 m - 3 < 3 m < 6]So, (m) can be 3, 4, or 5.Let's check each case:1. (m = 3):[p = 27 - 3^{0} = 27 - 1 = 26]So, (xy = 26). We need (x + y = 9) and (xy = 26). Let's solve for (x) and (y):The quadratic equation is (t^2 - 9t + 26 = 0). The discriminant is (81 - 104 = -23), which is negative. So, no real solutions, hence no integer solutions.2. (m = 4):[p = 27 - 3^{1} = 27 - 3 = 24]So, (xy = 24). With (x + y = 9), let's solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 9t + 24 = 0). Discriminant: (81 - 96 = -15). Again, negative discriminant, no real solutions.3. (m = 5):[p = 27 - 3^{2} = 27 - 9 = 18]So, (xy = 18). With (x + y = 9), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 9t + 18 = 0). Discriminant: (81 - 72 = 9). Square root of 9 is 3.Solutions:[t = frac{9 pm 3}{2} = frac{12}{2} = 6 quad text{or} quad frac{6}{2} = 3]So, (x = 6), (y = 3) or (x = 3), (y = 6).Let me check these solutions in the original equation:For (x = 6), (y = 3):[6^3 + 3^3 = 216 + 27 = 243 = 3^5]Yes, that works. Similarly, (x = 3), (y = 6) gives the same result.So, another set of solutions: (x = 6), (y = 3), (n = 3), (m = 5) and (x = 3), (y = 6), (n = 3), (m = 5).Wait, but earlier when (k = 1), we had solutions with (m = 2), and now with (k = 2), we have solutions with (m = 5). Is there a pattern here?Let me see if I can find more solutions by increasing (k). Let's try (k = 3):If (k = 3), then (x + y = 27). Then, (x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3^{m - 3}).Again, let (s = x + y = 27), (p = xy). Then,[x^2 - xy + y^2 = s^2 - 3p = 729 - 3p = 3^{m - 3}]So,[729 - 3p = 3^{m - 3} 3p = 729 - 3^{m - 3} p = frac{729 - 3^{m - 3}}{3} = 243 - 3^{m - 4}]Again, (p = xy) must be positive, so:[243 - 3^{m - 4} > 0 3^{m - 4} < 243 3^{m - 4} < 3^5 m - 4 < 5 m < 9]So, (m) can be 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.Let's check each:1. (m = 4):[p = 243 - 3^{0} = 243 - 1 = 242]So, (xy = 242). With (x + y = 27), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 27t + 242 = 0). Discriminant: (729 - 968 = -239). No real solutions.2. (m = 5):[p = 243 - 3^{1} = 243 - 3 = 240]So, (xy = 240). With (x + y = 27), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 27t + 240 = 0). Discriminant: (729 - 960 = -231). No real solutions.3. (m = 6):[p = 243 - 3^{2} = 243 - 9 = 234]So, (xy = 234). With (x + y = 27), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 27t + 234 = 0). Discriminant: (729 - 936 = -207). No real solutions.4. (m = 7):[p = 243 - 3^{3} = 243 - 27 = 216]So, (xy = 216). With (x + y = 27), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 27t + 216 = 0). Discriminant: (729 - 864 = -135). No real solutions.5. (m = 8):[p = 243 - 3^{4} = 243 - 81 = 162]So, (xy = 162). With (x + y = 27), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 27t + 162 = 0). Discriminant: (729 - 648 = 81). Square root of 81 is 9.Solutions:[t = frac{27 pm 9}{2} = frac{36}{2} = 18 quad text{or} quad frac{18}{2} = 9]So, (x = 18), (y = 9) or (x = 9), (y = 18).Let me check these in the original equation:For (x = 18), (y = 9):[18^3 + 9^3 = 5832 + 729 = 6561 = 3^8]Yes, that works. Similarly, (x = 9), (y = 18) gives the same result.So, another set of solutions: (x = 18), (y = 9), (n = 3), (m = 8) and (x = 9), (y = 18), (n = 3), (m = 8).Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time I increase (k) by 1, (m) increases by 3. For (k = 1), (m = 2); for (k = 2), (m = 5); for (k = 3), (m = 8). So, it seems like (m = 3k - 1). Let me check:For (k = 1), (m = 3(1) - 1 = 2). Correct.For (k = 2), (m = 3(2) - 1 = 5). Correct.For (k = 3), (m = 3(3) - 1 = 8). Correct.So, if this pattern continues, for (k = 4), (m = 11), and so on. Let me test (k = 4):If (k = 4), then (x + y = 81). Then,[x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3^{m - 4}]Let (s = 81), (p = xy). Then,[x^2 - xy + y^2 = s^2 - 3p = 6561 - 3p = 3^{m - 4}]So,[6561 - 3p = 3^{m - 4} 3p = 6561 - 3^{m - 4} p = frac{6561 - 3^{m - 4}}{3} = 2187 - 3^{m - 5}]Again, (p > 0), so:[2187 - 3^{m - 5} > 0 3^{m - 5} < 2187 3^{m - 5} < 3^7 m - 5 < 7 m < 12]So, (m) can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11.Let me check (m = 11):[p = 2187 - 3^{6} = 2187 - 729 = 1458]So, (xy = 1458). With (x + y = 81), solve:Quadratic equation: (t^2 - 81t + 1458 = 0). Discriminant: (6561 - 5832 = 729). Square root of 729 is 27.Solutions:[t = frac{81 pm 27}{2} = frac{108}{2} = 54 quad text{or} quad frac{54}{2} = 27]So, (x = 54), (y = 27) or (x = 27), (y = 54).Check in the original equation:For (x = 54), (y = 27):[54^3 + 27^3 = 157464 + 19683 = 177147 = 3^{11}]Yes, that works. Similarly, (x = 27), (y = 54) gives the same result.So, another set of solutions: (x = 54), (y = 27), (n = 3), (m = 11) and (x = 27), (y = 54), (n = 3), (m = 11).This pattern seems to continue indefinitely. Each time (k) increases by 1, (m) increases by 3, and the solutions for (x) and (y) are multiples of the previous solutions. Specifically, each time, (x) and (y) are multiplied by 3.So, in general, for any (k geq 1), we have solutions:[x = 3^{k - 1}, quad y = 2 cdot 3^{k - 1}]and[x = 2 cdot 3^{k - 1}, quad y = 3^{k - 1}]with (m = 3k - 1).Wait, let me verify this for (k = 1):[x = 3^{0} = 1, quad y = 2 cdot 3^{0} = 2]and[x = 2 cdot 3^{0} = 2, quad y = 3^{0} = 1]with (m = 3(1) - 1 = 2). Correct.For (k = 2):[x = 3^{1} = 3, quad y = 2 cdot 3^{1} = 6]and[x = 2 cdot 3^{1} = 6, quad y = 3^{1} = 3]with (m = 3(2) - 1 = 5). Correct.For (k = 3):[x = 3^{2} = 9, quad y = 2 cdot 3^{2} = 18]and[x = 2 cdot 3^{2} = 18, quad y = 3^{2} = 9]with (m = 3(3) - 1 = 8). Correct.So, this general formula seems to hold. Therefore, for any (k geq 1), we have solutions where (x) and (y) are (3^{k - 1}) and (2 cdot 3^{k - 1}), and (m = 3k - 1).But wait, earlier when I tried (n = 2), there were no solutions. Let me check if this is the case for other values of (n).Let me try (n = 4). So, the equation becomes (x^4 + y^4 = 3^m).Again, considering modulo 3, since (x^4) and (y^4) can be 0 or 1 modulo 3 (since 0^4 ‚â° 0, 1^4 ‚â° 1, 2^4 ‚â° 16 ‚â° 1 mod 3). So, their sum can be 0, 1, or 2 mod 3. But (3^m ‚â° 0 mod 3), so the sum must be 0 mod 3. Therefore, both (x^4) and (y^4) must be 0 mod 3, meaning both (x) and (y) must be multiples of 3.Let me write (x = 3a), (y = 3b). Then,[(3a)^4 + (3b)^4 = 3^m 81a^4 + 81b^4 = 3^m 81(a^4 + b^4) = 3^m 3^4(a^4 + b^4) = 3^m]So, (a^4 + b^4 = 3^{m - 4}). This is similar to the original equation but with smaller exponents. Let me denote (k = m - 4), so (a^4 + b^4 = 3^k).If (k = 0), then (a^4 + b^4 = 1), which only has trivial solutions (a = 1), (b = 0) or vice versa, but (b) must be positive, so no solution.If (k = 1), then (a^4 + b^4 = 3). The possible fourth powers less than or equal to 3 are 0 and 1. So, possible combinations:- (a^4 = 0), (b^4 = 3): Not possible since 3 is not a fourth power.- (a^4 = 1), (b^4 = 2): Not possible since 2 is not a fourth power.So, no solutions for (k = 1).If (k = 2), then (a^4 + b^4 = 9). The fourth powers less than or equal to 9 are 0, 1, and 16 (but 16 > 9). So, possible combinations:- (a^4 = 0), (b^4 = 9): Not possible since 9 is not a fourth power.- (a^4 = 1), (b^4 = 8): Not possible since 8 is not a fourth power.So, no solutions for (k = 2).If (k = 3), then (a^4 + b^4 = 27). Fourth powers less than or equal to 27 are 0, 1, 16, and 81 (but 81 > 27). So, possible combinations:- (a^4 = 0), (b^4 = 27): Not possible.- (a^4 = 1), (b^4 = 26): Not possible.- (a^4 = 16), (b^4 = 11): Not possible.No solutions.Similarly, for higher (k), the same issue arises because the sum of two fourth powers would require both to be multiples of 3, leading to an infinite descent, similar to the (n = 2) case. Therefore, there are no solutions for (n = 4).This suggests that for even (n), there are no solutions, while for odd (n), specifically (n = 3), we have solutions as found earlier.Let me test (n = 5). The equation becomes (x^5 + y^5 = 3^m).Again, considering modulo 3. The fifth powers modulo 3:- (0^5 ‚â° 0)- (1^5 ‚â° 1)- (2^5 ‚â° 32 ‚â° 2 mod 3)So, possible residues for (x^5) and (y^5) are 0, 1, or 2 mod 3. Their sum must be 0 mod 3.Possible combinations:- 0 + 0 = 0- 1 + 2 = 0- 2 + 1 = 0So, either both (x) and (y) are multiples of 3, or one is congruent to 1 mod 3 and the other to 2 mod 3.Case 1: Both (x) and (y) are multiples of 3.Let (x = 3a), (y = 3b). Then,[(3a)^5 + (3b)^5 = 3^m 243a^5 + 243b^5 = 3^m 243(a^5 + b^5) = 3^m 3^5(a^5 + b^5) = 3^m]So, (a^5 + b^5 = 3^{m - 5}). This is similar to the original equation, leading to an infinite descent unless (m - 5 = 0), which would mean (m = 5). Then, (a^5 + b^5 = 1), which only has trivial solutions (a = 1), (b = 0) or vice versa, but (b) must be positive. So, no solutions in this case.Case 2: One of (x) or (y) is congruent to 1 mod 3, and the other to 2 mod 3.Without loss of generality, let (x ‚â° 1 mod 3) and (y ‚â° 2 mod 3). Then, (x = 3a + 1), (y = 3b + 2).Substituting into the equation:[(3a + 1)^5 + (3b + 2)^5 = 3^m]Expanding both terms using the binomial theorem:First, ((3a + 1)^5):[= 3^5a^5 + 5 cdot 3^4a^4 + 10 cdot 3^3a^3 + 10 cdot 3^2a^2 + 5 cdot 3a + 1][= 243a^5 + 405a^4 + 270a^3 + 90a^2 + 15a + 1]Similarly, ((3b + 2)^5):[= 3^5b^5 + 5 cdot 3^4b^4 cdot 2 + 10 cdot 3^3b^3 cdot 4 + 10 cdot 3^2b^2 cdot 8 + 5 cdot 3b cdot 16 + 32][= 243b^5 + 810b^4 + 1080b^3 + 720b^2 + 240b + 32]Adding both together:[243a^5 + 405a^4 + 270a^3 + 90a^2 + 15a + 1 + 243b^5 + 810b^4 + 1080b^3 + 720b^2 + 240b + 32 = 3^m]Combine like terms:[243(a^5 + b^5) + 405a^4 + 810b^4 + 270a^3 + 1080b^3 + 90a^2 + 720b^2 + 15a + 240b + 33 = 3^m]Notice that all terms except the constant 33 are multiples of 3. So, the entire left side is congruent to 33 mod 3, which is 0 mod 3. Therefore, the equation is consistent modulo 3.However, the constant term is 33, which is (3 times 11). So, unless 11 divides the rest of the terms, which are all multiples of 3, we might have an issue. But since 11 is a prime not dividing 3, this suggests that the equation can't hold unless all the variable terms cancel out the 33, which is unlikely for positive integers (a) and (b).Therefore, it's highly probable that there are no solutions for (n = 5).This pattern suggests that for (n > 3), especially odd (n), it's difficult to find solutions because the equation leads to an infinite descent or the constant terms introduce primes other than 3, which can't be canceled out.Therefore, the only solutions occur when (n = 3), and they follow the pattern I found earlier, where (x) and (y) are multiples of 3 raised to some power, and (m) is related to the exponent.So, summarizing my findings:- For (n = 2), there are no solutions.- For (n = 3), there are infinitely many solutions of the form (x = 3^{k - 1}), (y = 2 cdot 3^{k - 1}) and (x = 2 cdot 3^{k - 1}), (y = 3^{k - 1}) for (k geq 1), with (m = 3k - 1).- For (n geq 4), whether even or odd, there are no solutions.Therefore, the only positive integer solutions to the equation (x^n + y^n = 3^m) with (m, n geq 2) are when (n = 3) and (x) and (y) are as described above.To present the solutions explicitly, for each positive integer (k), we have:[(x, y, n, m) = left(3^{k - 1}, 2 cdot 3^{k - 1}, 3, 3k - 1right) quad text{and} quad left(2 cdot 3^{k - 1}, 3^{k - 1}, 3, 3k - 1right)]For example:- When (k = 1): (x = 1), (y = 2), (n = 3), (m = 2).- When (k = 2): (x = 3), (y = 6), (n = 3), (m = 5).- When (k = 3): (x = 9), (y = 18), (n = 3), (m = 8).- And so on.These are all the solutions because for other values of (n), the equation doesn't hold due to the reasons discussed earlier.**Final Answer**The only positive integer solutions are when (n = 3) and (x) and (y) are powers of 3 multiplied by 1 or 2. Specifically, the solutions are (boxed{(x, y, n, m) = (3^{k-1}, 2 cdot 3^{k-1}, 3, 3k - 1)}) and (boxed{(2 cdot 3^{k-1}, 3^{k-1}, 3, 3k - 1)}) for each positive integer (k)."},{"question":"The general term formula of the sequence {a_n} is a_{n}=(-1)^{n}(n^{2}+1), then a_{3}= Ôºà„ÄÄ„ÄÄÔºâA: -10B: -4C: 10D: -7","answer":"First, I need to find the value of ( a_3 ) using the given general term formula ( a_n = (-1)^n (n^2 + 1) ).I'll substitute ( n = 3 ) into the formula:[a_3 = (-1)^3 (3^2 + 1)]Calculating the exponent:[(-1)^3 = -1]Next, I'll compute the expression inside the parentheses:[3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10]Now, I'll multiply the two results together:[a_3 = -1 times 10 = -10]Therefore, the value of ( a_3 ) is (-10), which corresponds to option A."},{"question":"Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug.

Now, the problem says he spends 1/4 of that amount of time cleaning the inside. Hmm, so I need to figure out what 1/4 of 80 minutes is. Let me think about how to calculate that. Alright, to find a quarter of 80, I can divide 80 by 4. So, 80 divided by 4 equals 20. That means Matt spends 20 minutes cleaning the inside of his car. Now, to find the total time he spends cleaning his car, I need to add the time he spends on the outside and the inside together. So, 80 minutes plus 20 minutes. Let me do that addition. 80 plus 20 is 100. Wait, does that make sense? If he spends 80 minutes on the outside and a quarter of that on the inside, which is 20 minutes, adding them together should give the total time. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, interesting. I remember that the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is the smallest number that both numbers divide into. So, for example, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 6) = 12), and so on.First, maybe I should try plugging in some small numbers for (x), (y), and (z) to see what kind of results I get. Let me start with (x = y = z = 1). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1), so the expression becomes (frac{1 + 1}{1} = 2). Okay, so 2 is achievable.What if I take (x = 1), (y = 2), and (z = 1)? Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 2) = 2), (operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So the expression is (frac{2 + 2}{1} = 4). So 4 is also achievable.Wait, so maybe even numbers are possible? Let me try another one. Let‚Äôs take (x = 2), (y = 4), and (z = 2). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 4) = 4), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 2) = 4), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 2). So the expression becomes (frac{4 + 4}{2} = 4). Hmm, same result.What if I try (x = 1), (y = 3), (z = 1)? Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 3) = 3), (operatorname{lcm}(3, 1) = 3), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So the expression is (frac{3 + 3}{1} = 6). So 6 is achievable as well.Wait a second, so 2, 4, 6... It seems like even numbers are coming up. Let me see if I can get an odd number. Let's try (x = 2), (y = 3), (z = 2). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(3, 2) = 6), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 2). So the expression is (frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6). Still even.How about (x = 3), (y = 3), (z = 3)? Then, (operatorname{lcm}(3, 3) = 3), so the expression is (frac{3 + 3}{3} = 2). Again, even.Is it possible to get an odd number? Let me try (x = 1), (y = 2), (z = 2). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 2) = 2), (operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 2), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 2) = 2). So the expression is (frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2). Still even.Wait, maybe I need to try different numbers. Let me try (x = 2), (y = 6), (z = 3). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 6) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(6, 3) = 6), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6). So the expression is (frac{6 + 6}{6} = 2). Still even.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try (x = 3), (y = 6), (z = 2). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(3, 6) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(6, 2) = 6), and (operatorname{lcm}(3, 2) = 6). So the expression is (frac{6 + 6}{6} = 2). Again, even.Wait, is it possible that only even numbers can be achieved? Let me see if I can get 8. Let me take (x = 1), (y = 4), (z = 1). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 4) = 4), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 1) = 4), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So the expression is (frac{4 + 4}{1} = 8). Yes, 8 is achievable.What about 10? Let me try (x = 1), (y = 5), (z = 1). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, 5) = 5), (operatorname{lcm}(5, 1) = 5), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So the expression is (frac{5 + 5}{1} = 10). So 10 is achievable.Wait, so it seems like any even number can be achieved by setting (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), where (n) is an integer. Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, n) = n), (operatorname{lcm}(n, 1) = n), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So the expression becomes (frac{n + n}{1} = 2n), which is even. So any even number can be expressed in this form.But what about odd numbers? Is there a way to get an odd number? Let me try (x = 2), (y = 3), (z = 6). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(3, 6) = 6), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 6) = 6). So the expression is (frac{6 + 6}{6} = 2). Still even.Another attempt: (x = 3), (y = 4), (z = 6). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(3, 4) = 12), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 6) = 12), and (operatorname{lcm}(3, 6) = 6). So the expression is (frac{12 + 12}{6} = 4). Still even.Wait, maybe I need to use higher numbers. Let me try (x = 4), (y = 6), (z = 8). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(4, 6) = 12), (operatorname{lcm}(6, 8) = 24), and (operatorname{lcm}(4, 8) = 8). So the expression is (frac{12 + 24}{8} = frac{36}{8} = 4.5). Hmm, that's not an integer. So that doesn't work.Wait, but the problem specifies that the result must be a positive integer, so fractions like 4.5 are not acceptable. So, that attempt didn't work.Let me try (x = 2), (y = 4), (z = 8). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 4) = 4), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 8) = 8), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 8) = 8). So the expression is (frac{4 + 8}{8} = frac{12}{8} = 1.5). Again, not an integer.Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let me think about the structure of the expression. The numerator is the sum of two lcm terms, and the denominator is another lcm term. Maybe I can express this in terms of prime factors or something.Let me recall that for any two numbers, (operatorname{lcm}(a, b) times gcd(a, b) = a times b). So, maybe I can use this property to break down the expression.But I'm not sure if that will help directly. Maybe I should consider the exponents in the prime factorization. For example, for each prime (p), the exponent in (operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) is the maximum of the exponents in (a) and (b).So, perhaps I can analyze the exponents of a particular prime in the numerator and denominator. Let me consider a prime (p) and look at the exponents in (operatorname{lcm}(x, y)), (operatorname{lcm}(y, z)), and (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)).Let me denote (v_p(n)) as the exponent of (p) in the prime factorization of (n). Then, (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) = max(v_p(x), v_p(y))), and similarly for the others.So, the exponent of (p) in the numerator is the maximum of (v_p(x)) and (v_p(y)) plus the maximum of (v_p(y)) and (v_p(z)). Wait, no, actually, the numerator is the sum of two terms, each of which is an lcm. So, when adding two numbers, the exponent of (p) in the sum is at least the minimum of the exponents in the two terms.Wait, that might be more complicated. Let me think again.If I have two numbers (a) and (b), then (v_p(a + b)) is at least (min(v_p(a), v_p(b))), but it could be higher if there's a carryover in the addition.But in our case, the numerator is (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)), so for each prime (p), (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq min(v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)), v_p(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)))).Similarly, the denominator is (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)), so (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) = max(v_p(x), v_p(z))).For the entire expression to be an integer, the exponent of each prime (p) in the numerator must be at least as large as in the denominator. So, for each prime (p), we must have:[v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, z))]But since (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) = max(v_p(x), v_p(y))) and (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = max(v_p(y), v_p(z))), the minimum of these two is (min(max(v_p(x), v_p(y)), max(v_p(y), v_p(z)))).Let me denote (a = v_p(x)), (b = v_p(y)), and (c = v_p(z)). Without loss of generality, assume (a leq b leq c). Then, (max(a, b) = b) and (max(b, c) = c). So, the minimum of these two is (b).Therefore, (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq b), and (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) = c).So, for the expression to be an integer, we must have (b geq c). But we assumed (a leq b leq c), so (b geq c) implies (b = c).Therefore, for each prime (p), the exponents in (y) and (z) must be equal, i.e., (v_p(y) = v_p(z)).Wait, that's interesting. So, for each prime (p), (v_p(y) = v_p(z)). That means that (y) and (z) must have the same exponents for all primes, which implies that (y = z). Because if for every prime (p), (v_p(y) = v_p(z)), then (y) and (z) must be equal.Wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think. If (y) and (z) have the same exponents for all primes, then yes, (y = z). Because the prime factorization is unique.So, if (y = z), then the expression simplifies. Let me substitute (z = y). Then, the expression becomes:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, y)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)} = frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)}]Since (operatorname{lcm}(y, y) = y).So, this simplifies to:[1 + frac{y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)}]Now, (operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) is a multiple of both (x) and (y), so (frac{y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)}) is at most 1, and it's equal to (frac{y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)} = frac{y}{frac{xy}{gcd(x, y)}}} = frac{gcd(x, y)}{x}).So, the expression becomes:[1 + frac{gcd(x, y)}{x}]Which is equal to:[1 + frac{d}{x}]Where (d = gcd(x, y)). Since (d) divides (x), let me write (x = d cdot k) for some integer (k). Then, the expression becomes:[1 + frac{d}{d cdot k} = 1 + frac{1}{k}]So, the expression is (1 + frac{1}{k}), which is equal to (frac{k + 1}{k}).But since (k) is a positive integer, (frac{k + 1}{k}) is a rational number greater than 1 but less than or equal to 2 (since (k geq 1), the maximum value is when (k = 1), giving 2).Wait, but we need the entire expression to be an integer. So, (frac{k + 1}{k}) must be an integer. Let me see when that happens.(frac{k + 1}{k} = 1 + frac{1}{k}) is an integer only when (frac{1}{k}) is an integer. But (frac{1}{k}) is an integer only when (k = 1). Because for (k > 1), (frac{1}{k}) is a fraction less than 1.So, if (k = 1), then (x = d cdot 1 = d), and since (d = gcd(x, y)), (d) divides (y). So, (y = d cdot m) for some integer (m). But since (z = y), (z = d cdot m) as well.So, substituting back, (x = d), (y = d cdot m), (z = d cdot m). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = operatorname{lcm}(d, d cdot m) = d cdot m), and (operatorname{lcm}(x, z) = operatorname{lcm}(d, d cdot m) = d cdot m).So, the expression becomes:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, z)} = frac{d cdot m + d cdot m}{d cdot m} = frac{2 d m}{d m} = 2]So, in this case, the expression equals 2. Therefore, when (y = z), the expression can only be 2.But earlier, I saw that by setting (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), I can get any even number. So, there's a contradiction here. Wait, no, because in that case, (y neq z), right? Because (y = n) and (z = 1), so unless (n = 1), (y neq z).Wait, so earlier, I assumed (y = z), but in the case where (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), (y) and (z) are not equal unless (n = 1). So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that (y = z) is necessary is only under certain conditions.Wait, let me go back. I considered the exponents for each prime (p), and concluded that (v_p(y) = v_p(z)) for all primes (p), which implies (y = z). But in the case where (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), (y) and (z) are not equal, but the expression still gives an integer. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was flawed.Wait, let me re-examine the exponent argument. I said that for each prime (p), (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, z))). But in the case where (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), let's look at the exponents.Let me take a specific prime (p). Suppose (p) divides (n), so (v_p(y) = v_p(n)), and (v_p(z) = v_p(1) = 0). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = operatorname{lcm}(1, n) = n), so (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) = v_p(n)). Similarly, (operatorname{lcm}(y, z) = operatorname{lcm}(n, 1) = n), so (v_p(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = v_p(n)). Therefore, the numerator is (n + n = 2n), so (v_p(text{numerator}) = v_p(2n)). The denominator is (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1), so (v_p(text{denominator}) = 0).Thus, (v_p(text{numerator}) geq v_p(text{denominator})) is automatically satisfied because (v_p(text{numerator}) geq 0). So, in this case, the exponent condition is satisfied without requiring (v_p(y) = v_p(z)).Wait, so my earlier conclusion that (v_p(y) = v_p(z)) for all primes (p) might not hold in general. It seems that when (x = 1), (z = 1), the exponents in (y) can be arbitrary, and the expression still results in an integer. So, perhaps my initial assumption that (y = z) is necessary was incorrect.Therefore, maybe the condition is not as strict as requiring (y = z), but rather something else. Let me try to think differently.Let me consider the expression again:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, z)}]I want this to be an integer. Let me denote (A = operatorname{lcm}(x, y)), (B = operatorname{lcm}(y, z)), and (C = operatorname{lcm}(x, z)). So, the expression is (frac{A + B}{C}).For this to be an integer, (C) must divide (A + B). So, (C | (A + B)).Now, since (C = operatorname{lcm}(x, z)), and (A = operatorname{lcm}(x, y)), (B = operatorname{lcm}(y, z)), perhaps there is a relationship between these lcm terms.Let me think about the properties of lcm. We know that (operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) is the smallest number divisible by both (a) and (b). So, (A) is divisible by both (x) and (y), (B) is divisible by both (y) and (z), and (C) is divisible by both (x) and (z).Now, since (A) is divisible by (x) and (y), and (B) is divisible by (y) and (z), their sum (A + B) is divisible by (y), because both (A) and (B) are divisible by (y). Therefore, (y | (A + B)).Similarly, (C) is divisible by (x) and (z). So, for (C) to divide (A + B), (C) must divide a number that is divisible by (y). Therefore, (C) must divide (A + B), which is divisible by (y). So, (C) must divide a multiple of (y).But (C) is (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)), which is the smallest number divisible by both (x) and (z). So, perhaps (y) must be a multiple of (C), or something like that.Wait, not necessarily. Let me think. If (C) divides (A + B), and (A + B) is divisible by (y), then (C) must divide some multiple of (y). But (C) itself is (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)), so it's the least common multiple of (x) and (z).Alternatively, maybe (C) divides (A + B), which is (A + B = operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)). So, perhaps we can find conditions on (x), (y), and (z) such that (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) divides (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)).Let me try to express everything in terms of (x), (y), and (z). Let me denote (d = gcd(x, y)), (e = gcd(y, z)), and (f = gcd(x, z)). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = frac{x y}{d}), (operatorname{lcm}(y, z) = frac{y z}{e}), and (operatorname{lcm}(x, z) = frac{x z}{f}).So, the expression becomes:[frac{frac{x y}{d} + frac{y z}{e}}{frac{x z}{f}} = frac{y}{x z} left( frac{x}{d} + frac{z}{e} right) cdot f]Simplifying, we get:[frac{y f}{x z} left( frac{x}{d} + frac{z}{e} right) = frac{y f}{x z} left( frac{x e + z d}{d e} right) = frac{y f (x e + z d)}{x z d e}]Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.Let me consider specific cases where the expression simplifies nicely. For example, if (x = z), then (operatorname{lcm}(x, z) = x), and the expression becomes:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, x)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, x)} = frac{2 operatorname{lcm}(x, y)}{x}]Since (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = frac{x y}{gcd(x, y)}), this becomes:[frac{2 cdot frac{x y}{gcd(x, y)}}{x} = frac{2 y}{gcd(x, y)}]So, the expression simplifies to (frac{2 y}{gcd(x, y)}). Let me denote (d = gcd(x, y)), so (x = d cdot a) and (y = d cdot b) where (gcd(a, b) = 1). Then, the expression becomes:[frac{2 d b}{d} = 2 b]Since (b) is a positive integer, this shows that any even number can be achieved by choosing appropriate (x) and (y) such that (x = d cdot a) and (y = d cdot b) with (gcd(a, b) = 1). For example, setting (a = 1), (b = n), and (d = 1), we get the expression equal to (2n), which is any even number.So, this shows that all even positive integers can be expressed in the given form. Now, the question is, can any odd positive integer be expressed in this form?From the earlier attempts, it seems difficult to get an odd number. Let me try to see if it's possible. Suppose the expression equals an odd integer (k). Then,[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, z)} = k]Which implies:[operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z) = k cdot operatorname{lcm}(x, z)]Now, let me consider the prime factorization, particularly focusing on the exponent of 2. Let (v_2(n)) denote the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of (n). Then,[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = v_2(k cdot operatorname{lcm}(x, z))]Since (k) is odd, (v_2(k) = 0). Therefore,[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, z))]Now, using the property of exponents in sums, we have:[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq min(v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)), v_2(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)))]Let me denote (a = v_2(x)), (b = v_2(y)), and (c = v_2(z)). Without loss of generality, assume (a leq b leq c). Then,[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) = max(a, b) = b][v_2(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = max(b, c) = c][v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) = max(a, c) = c]So, the left-hand side of the equation is:[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq min(b, c) = b]And the right-hand side is:[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) = c]Therefore, we have:[b leq c]But we assumed (a leq b leq c), so this is consistent. However, for the equality (v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = c) to hold, we must have:[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = c]But (operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) has (v_2) equal to (b), and (operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) has (v_2) equal to (c). So, when adding these two terms, the exponent of 2 in the sum is at least (b), but to have it equal to (c), we must have that the term with the lower exponent does not affect the higher exponent term. That is, (operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) must be divisible by (2^b) but not by (2^{b+1}), and (operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) must be divisible by (2^c). When adding them, if (b < c), then the term (operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) is divisible by (2^b) but not (2^{b+1}), and (operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) is divisible by (2^c). Therefore, their sum will have (v_2) equal to (b), because the term with the lower exponent will dominate the sum's exponent.But we need (v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = c), which is greater than (b). This is only possible if (b = c), because otherwise, the sum would have (v_2) equal to (b), which is less than (c). Therefore, (b = c).So, (v_2(y) = v_2(z)). Therefore, (y) and (z) must have the same exponent of 2 in their prime factorizations.But this is just for the prime 2. What about other primes? Let me consider another prime (p neq 2). Let me denote (v_p(x) = a), (v_p(y) = b), (v_p(z) = c). Without loss of generality, assume (a leq b leq c).Then,[v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y)) = b][v_p(operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = c][v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) = c]So, similar to the case with 2, we have:[v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) geq min(b, c) = b]And we need:[v_p(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = c]Which again implies that (b = c), because otherwise, the sum would have (v_p) equal to (b), which is less than (c).Therefore, for all primes (p), (v_p(y) = v_p(z)). This implies that (y = z), because their prime factorizations are identical.So, going back to the original expression, if (y = z), then:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, y)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)} = frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)} = 1 + frac{y}{operatorname{lcm}(x, y)}]As I derived earlier, this simplifies to (1 + frac{gcd(x, y)}{x}), which is (1 + frac{d}{x}) where (d = gcd(x, y)). Let (x = d cdot k), then this becomes (1 + frac{1}{k}), which is only an integer if (k = 1), giving the expression equal to 2.Therefore, the only way the expression can be an integer is if (y = z) and (x) is a multiple of (gcd(x, y)), which only gives the expression equal to 2. But earlier, I saw that by setting (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), I can get any even number. So, how does this reconcile?Ah, because in that case, (y neq z) (unless (n = 1)), but the expression still results in an integer. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that (y = z) is necessary is only under certain conditions, but in reality, there are cases where (y neq z) and the expression is still an integer.Wait, let me think again. When (x = 1), (y = n), (z = 1), then (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = n), (operatorname{lcm}(y, z) = n), and (operatorname{lcm}(x, z) = 1). So, the expression is (frac{n + n}{1} = 2n), which is even. So, in this case, (y neq z), but the expression is still an integer.So, my earlier conclusion that (y = z) is necessary was incorrect because it only applies when considering the exponents of primes in the sum, but in this specific case, the denominator is 1, so the exponents don't impose the same restrictions.Therefore, to generalize, the expression can be an integer in two cases:1. When (y = z), leading to the expression equaling 2.2. When (x = 1) and (z = 1), leading to the expression equaling (2n) for any positive integer (n).But wait, actually, the second case is a specific instance of a more general scenario where (x) and (z) are set such that (operatorname{lcm}(x, z)) divides the sum (operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)). So, perhaps there are more general conditions where the expression can be an integer, not just when (y = z) or (x = z = 1).Let me try to find another example where (y neq z) and the expression is an integer. Let me take (x = 2), (y = 4), (z = 2). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 4) = 4), (operatorname{lcm}(4, 2) = 4), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 2). So, the expression is (frac{4 + 4}{2} = 4), which is even.Another example: (x = 2), (y = 6), (z = 3). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(2, 6) = 6), (operatorname{lcm}(6, 3) = 6), and (operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6). So, the expression is (frac{6 + 6}{6} = 2), which is even.Wait, so in these cases, even though (y neq z), the expression still results in an even integer. So, perhaps the key is that the expression always results in an even integer, regardless of whether (y = z) or not.But earlier, I saw that when (y = z), the expression can only be 2, but when (y neq z), it can be other even numbers. So, combining these, it seems that the expression can result in any even positive integer.To confirm, let me try to express an arbitrary even integer (2k) in the given form. Let me set (x = 1), (y = k), (z = 1). Then, (operatorname{lcm}(1, k) = k), (operatorname{lcm}(k, 1) = k), and (operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1). So, the expression is (frac{k + k}{1} = 2k), which is the desired even integer.Therefore, any even positive integer can be expressed in the given form. Now, to check if any odd positive integer can be expressed in this form, let me assume for contradiction that there exists an odd integer (k) such that:[frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, z)} = k]Then, as before, considering the exponent of 2, we have:[v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)) = v_2(operatorname{lcm}(x, z))]But as shown earlier, this leads to the conclusion that (v_2(y) = v_2(z)), and similarly for all other primes, implying (y = z). But when (y = z), the expression simplifies to 2, which is even, contradicting the assumption that (k) is odd.Therefore, no odd positive integer can be expressed in the given form.So, putting it all together, the positive integers that can be written in the form (frac{operatorname{lcm}(x, y) + operatorname{lcm}(y, z)}{operatorname{lcm}(x, z)}) are exactly the even positive integers."},{"question":"Evaluate log_8 512.","answer":"To evaluate (log_8 512), I start by expressing both 8 and 512 as powers of 2. 8 can be written as (2^3), and 512 can be written as (2^9).

Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out if such integers exist or not.First, I remember that when dealing with expressions like ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ), there's a special identity that applies when ( a + b + c = 0 ). The identity says that ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc ) in that case. Maybe I can use that here.Let me set ( a = x - y ), ( b = y - z ), and ( c = z - x ). Then, adding these up: ( a + b + c = (x - y) + (y - z) + (z - x) ). Simplifying that, the ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) terms cancel out: ( x - y + y - z + z - x = 0 ). So, indeed, ( a + b + c = 0 ).That means I can apply the identity: ( (x - y)^3 + (y - z)^3 + (z - x)^3 = 3(x - y)(y - z)(z - x) ). So the original equation simplifies to ( 3(x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = 2011 ).Now, I need to check if this equation can hold for integers ( x, y, z ). Let's see. The left side is 3 times the product of three integers, so it's divisible by 3. But the right side is 2011. Is 2011 divisible by 3?To check divisibility by 3, I can add the digits: 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4. Since 4 is not divisible by 3, 2011 isn't either. That means the left side is divisible by 3, but the right side isn't. That's a problem because both sides should be equal, but one is divisible by 3 and the other isn't.So, this suggests that there's a contradiction. If ( 3(x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = 2011 ), then 2011 must be divisible by 3, but it's not. Therefore, such integers ( x, y, z ) can't exist.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should double-check the identity. Yes, when ( a + b + c = 0 ), ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc ). That seems correct. And substituting ( a, b, c ) as the differences between ( x, y, z ) also makes sense because their sum is zero.Also, checking the divisibility: 2011 divided by 3 is approximately 670.333..., which isn't an integer. So, 2011 isn't divisible by 3. Therefore, the equation ( 3(x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = 2011 ) can't hold because the left side is a multiple of 3 and the right side isn't.I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing the identity and then checking the divisibility. Since 2011 isn't divisible by 3, there's no way for the product of three integers multiplied by 3 to equal 2011.So, my conclusion is that such integers ( x, y, z ) do not exist.**Final Answer**boxed{text{–ù–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç}}"},{"question":"There were 16 friends playing a video game online when 4 more players joined the game.

So the entire expression becomes:(E = a + 2b + c + 2d - (a + c)(b + d))Now, let me define some new variables to simplify this. Let me set (x = a + c) and (y = b + d). Then, the expression becomes:(E = x + 2y - xy)Wait, that's much simpler! So now, my problem reduces to maximizing (E = x + 2y - xy) where (x) and (y) are sums of variables within ([-10.5, 10.5]). Specifically, since (a) and (c) are each in ([-10.5, 10.5]), their sum (x) can range from (-21) to (21). Similarly, (y = b + d) can also range from (-21) to (21).So, now I need to maximize (E = x + 2y - xy) with (x, y in [-21, 21]).Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can treat this as a function of two variables and find its maximum over the given domain. To do this, I can consider the function (E(x, y) = x + 2y - xy) and look for its critical points by taking partial derivatives.First, let's compute the partial derivatives with respect to (x) and (y):(frac{partial E}{partial x} = 1 - y)(frac{partial E}{partial y} = 2 - x)Setting these partial derivatives equal to zero to find critical points:1. (1 - y = 0 Rightarrow y = 1)2. (2 - x = 0 Rightarrow x = 2)So, the critical point is at ((x, y) = (2, 1)). Now, I need to evaluate (E) at this critical point and also check the boundaries of the domain because the maximum could occur either at the critical point or on the boundary.Calculating (E) at the critical point:(E(2, 1) = 2 + 2(1) - (2)(1) = 2 + 2 - 2 = 2)Hmm, that's not very large. Maybe the maximum occurs on the boundary. Let's explore the boundaries.Since (x) and (y) can each range from (-21) to (21), the boundaries occur when either (x) or (y) is at their minimum or maximum values.But before I go into checking all possible boundaries, maybe I can rewrite the expression (E = x + 2y - xy) in a way that makes it easier to analyze.Let me factor out (y) from the last two terms:(E = x + y(2 - x))Alternatively, I can factor out (x):(E = x(1 - y) + 2y)Hmm, not sure if that helps much. Maybe another approach is to consider (E) as a linear function in one variable while keeping the other fixed.Let's fix (x) and see how (E) behaves as a function of (y):(E(y) = x + 2y - xy = x + y(2 - x))This is a linear function in (y) with slope (2 - x). So, depending on the value of (x), the function will either increase or decrease as (y) increases.Similarly, if I fix (y), then (E(x) = x + 2y - xy = x(1 - y) + 2y), which is linear in (x) with slope (1 - y).So, to maximize (E), for each fixed (x), I should choose (y) to be at its maximum or minimum depending on the slope.If (2 - x > 0), then (E(y)) increases as (y) increases, so to maximize (E), set (y = 21).If (2 - x < 0), then (E(y)) decreases as (y) increases, so to maximize (E), set (y = -21).Similarly, if (1 - y > 0), then (E(x)) increases as (x) increases, so set (x = 21).If (1 - y < 0), then (E(x)) decreases as (x) increases, so set (x = -21).This suggests that the maximum occurs at one of the corners of the domain, i.e., when (x) and (y) are at their extreme values.So, let's evaluate (E) at the four corners:1. (x = 21), (y = 21):(E = 21 + 2(21) - (21)(21) = 21 + 42 - 441 = 63 - 441 = -378)2. (x = 21), (y = -21):(E = 21 + 2(-21) - (21)(-21) = 21 - 42 + 441 = -21 + 441 = 420)3. (x = -21), (y = 21):(E = -21 + 2(21) - (-21)(21) = -21 + 42 + 441 = 21 + 441 = 462)4. (x = -21), (y = -21):(E = -21 + 2(-21) - (-21)(-21) = -21 - 42 - 441 = -504)So, among these four corner points, the maximum value is 462 at (x = -21), (y = 21).But wait, I should also check the other edges where either (x) or (y) is fixed at their extremes, but not both. For example, when (x = 21), (y) can vary between (-21) and (21), but we already checked the corners. Similarly, when (y = 21), (x) can vary, but again, the maximum on that edge was already found at (x = -21).However, just to be thorough, let me consider the edges.First, fix (x = 21):(E(y) = 21 + 2y - 21y = 21 - 19y)This is a linear function in (y) with slope (-19), which is negative. So, it's maximized at the smallest (y), which is (y = -21):(E = 21 - 19(-21) = 21 + 399 = 420)Which we already found.Next, fix (x = -21):(E(y) = -21 + 2y - (-21)y = -21 + 2y + 21y = -21 + 23y)This is a linear function in (y) with slope (23), positive. So, it's maximized at (y = 21):(E = -21 + 23(21) = -21 + 483 = 462)Which is our current maximum.Now, fix (y = 21):(E(x) = x + 2(21) - x(21) = x + 42 - 21x = -20x + 42)This is linear in (x) with slope (-20), negative. So, it's maximized at the smallest (x), which is (x = -21):(E = -20(-21) + 42 = 420 + 42 = 462)Again, same maximum.Fix (y = -21):(E(x) = x + 2(-21) - x(-21) = x - 42 + 21x = 22x - 42)This is linear in (x) with slope (22), positive. So, it's maximized at (x = 21):(E = 22(21) - 42 = 462 - 42 = 420)Which is less than 462.So, after checking all edges, the maximum is indeed 462 at (x = -21), (y = 21).But wait, let's make sure that (x = -21) and (y = 21) are achievable with the original variables (a, b, c, d) within ([-10.5, 10.5]).Since (x = a + c = -21), this requires (a = c = -10.5), because each can be as low as (-10.5), so their sum is (-21).Similarly, (y = b + d = 21) requires (b = d = 10.5), since each can be as high as (10.5), so their sum is (21).Therefore, the maximum value of (E) is achieved when (a = c = -10.5) and (b = d = 10.5).Let me plug these values back into the original expression to verify:(E = a + 2b + c + 2d - ab - bc - cd - da)Substituting (a = c = -10.5) and (b = d = 10.5):(E = (-10.5) + 2(10.5) + (-10.5) + 2(10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5))Let's compute each term step by step:1. (a = -10.5)2. (2b = 2(10.5) = 21)3. (c = -10.5)4. (2d = 2(10.5) = 21)5. (-ab = -(-10.5)(10.5) = 110.25)6. (-bc = -(10.5)(-10.5) = 110.25)7. (-cd = -(-10.5)(10.5) = 110.25)8. (-da = -(10.5)(-10.5) = 110.25)Now, summing all these up:(E = (-10.5) + 21 + (-10.5) + 21 + 110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25)Let's compute the linear terms first:(-10.5 + 21 - 10.5 + 21 = (-10.5 - 10.5) + (21 + 21) = (-21) + 42 = 21)Now, the quadratic terms:(110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25 = 4 times 110.25 = 441)Adding them together:(21 + 441 = 462)Yep, that checks out. So, the maximum value is indeed 462.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me think if there's another combination of (a, b, c, d) that could give a higher value. For example, what if I set some variables to their maximum and others to their minimum in a different configuration?Suppose I set (a = -10.5), (b = 10.5), (c = 10.5), (d = 10.5). Let's compute (E):(E = (-10.5) + 2(10.5) + 10.5 + 2(10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5))Calculating each term:1. (-10.5)2. (21)3. (10.5)4. (21)5. (110.25)6. (-110.25)7. (-110.25)8. (110.25)Adding them up:Linear terms: (-10.5 + 21 + 10.5 + 21 = 42)Quadratic terms: (110.25 - 110.25 - 110.25 + 110.25 = 0)Total (E = 42 + 0 = 42), which is much less than 462.Another test case: (a = 10.5), (b = 10.5), (c = 10.5), (d = 10.5):(E = 10.5 + 21 + 10.5 + 21 - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5))Linear terms: (10.5 + 21 + 10.5 + 21 = 63)Quadratic terms: (-4 times 110.25 = -441)Total (E = 63 - 441 = -378), which is negative.What if I set (a = -10.5), (b = -10.5), (c = -10.5), (d = -10.5):(E = (-10.5) + 2(-10.5) + (-10.5) + 2(-10.5) - (-10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(-10.5))Linear terms: (-10.5 -21 -10.5 -21 = -63)Quadratic terms: (-4 times 110.25 = -441)Total (E = -63 - 441 = -504), which is even worse.So, it seems that setting (a = c = -10.5) and (b = d = 10.5) gives the highest value. Let me try another configuration just to be thorough.Suppose (a = -10.5), (b = 10.5), (c = -10.5), (d = 10.5):This is actually the same as the first case because (a = c = -10.5) and (b = d = 10.5), so (E = 462).Alternatively, if I set (a = -10.5), (b = 10.5), (c = 10.5), (d = -10.5):Compute (E):(E = (-10.5) + 2(10.5) + 10.5 + 2(-10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(-10.5))Linear terms: (-10.5 + 21 + 10.5 -21 = 0)Quadratic terms: (110.25 - 110.25 + 110.25 - 110.25 = 0)Total (E = 0 + 0 = 0), which is less than 462.Another configuration: (a = 10.5), (b = -10.5), (c = 10.5), (d = -10.5):(E = 10.5 + 2(-10.5) + 10.5 + 2(-10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5) - (10.5)(-10.5) - (-10.5)(10.5))Linear terms: (10.5 -21 + 10.5 -21 = -21)Quadratic terms: (110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25 + 110.25 = 441)Total (E = -21 + 441 = 420), which is still less than 462.So, after testing several configurations, it seems that the maximum value is indeed achieved when (a = c = -10.5) and (b = d = 10.5), giving (E = 462).I think I've covered all possible configurations and edge cases, and consistently, the maximum value comes out to be 462. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The maximum value of the expression is boxed{462}."},{"question":"The derivative of the function y= sqrt {x} is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A:  frac {1}{2 sqrt {x}}B:  frac {1}{ sqrt {x}}C: 2 sqrt {x}D:  frac {1}{2} sqrt {x}","answer":"To find the derivative of the function ( y = sqrt{x} ), I start by rewriting the square root as a power.

If f(C)=2, c= sqrt {3}, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with two parts. Let me try to tackle them step by step. First, the function is given as ( f(x) = 2sqrt{3}sin x cos x - 2cos^2 x + 1 ). I need to find the set of values of ( x ) where this function reaches its maximum. Hmm, trigonometric function optimization. I remember that sometimes rewriting these functions using trigonometric identities can simplify things.Looking at ( f(x) ), I see terms with ( sin x cos x ) and ( cos^2 x ). Maybe I can use double-angle identities here. Let me recall that ( sin 2x = 2sin x cos x ) and ( cos 2x = 2cos^2 x - 1 ). So, let's rewrite ( f(x) ) using these identities. First, ( 2sqrt{3}sin x cos x ) can be written as ( sqrt{3}sin 2x ) because ( 2sin x cos x = sin 2x ), so multiplying by ( sqrt{3} ) gives ( sqrt{3}sin 2x ).Next, the term ( -2cos^2 x ) can be rewritten using the identity ( cos 2x = 2cos^2 x - 1 ). Solving for ( cos^2 x ), we get ( cos^2 x = frac{1 + cos 2x}{2} ). So, substituting back, ( -2cos^2 x = -2 times frac{1 + cos 2x}{2} = -1 - cos 2x ).Putting it all together, ( f(x) = sqrt{3}sin 2x - 1 - cos 2x + 1 ). The ( -1 ) and ( +1 ) cancel out, so we're left with ( f(x) = sqrt{3}sin 2x - cos 2x ).Hmm, this looks like a single sine or cosine function. Maybe I can express it as a single sine function using the amplitude-phase form. The general form is ( Asin(2x + phi) ) or ( Acos(2x + phi) ). Let me try that.The expression ( sqrt{3}sin 2x - cos 2x ) can be written as ( Rsin(2x - phi) ), where ( R ) is the amplitude and ( phi ) is the phase shift. To find ( R ) and ( phi ), I can use the formula:( R = sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{3 + 1} = sqrt{4} = 2 ).Then, ( sin phi = frac{-1}{R} = frac{-1}{2} ) and ( cos phi = frac{sqrt{3}}{R} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).So, ( phi ) is the angle whose sine is ( -1/2 ) and cosine is ( sqrt{3}/2 ). That corresponds to ( phi = -frac{pi}{6} ) because ( sin(-pi/6) = -1/2 ) and ( cos(-pi/6) = sqrt{3}/2 ).Therefore, ( f(x) = 2sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) ).Now, to find the maximum of ( f(x) ), since the sine function has a maximum value of 1, the maximum of ( f(x) ) is ( 2 times 1 = 2 ). This occurs when ( sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) = 1 ).So, ( 2x - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi ) for some integer ( k ). Solving for ( x ):( 2x = frac{pi}{2} + frac{pi}{6} + 2kpi = frac{2pi}{3} + 2kpi )( x = frac{pi}{3} + kpi ).So, the set of values where ( f(x) ) reaches its maximum is ( x = frac{pi}{3} + kpi ) for any integer ( k ).Okay, that was part (1). Now, moving on to part (2). We have triangle ( ABC ) with angles ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) opposite sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) respectively. We're told that ( f(C) = 2 ) and ( c = sqrt{3} ). We need to find the maximum area of triangle ( ABC ).First, since ( f(C) = 2 ), from part (1), we know that ( f(x) ) reaches its maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{3} + kpi ). But in a triangle, angles are between 0 and ( pi ), so the only possible value for ( C ) is ( frac{pi}{3} ) because ( frac{pi}{3} + kpi ) would be outside the range for other integer values of ( k ).So, angle ( C = frac{pi}{3} ).Now, we need to find the maximum area of triangle ( ABC ) with side ( c = sqrt{3} ) opposite angle ( C = frac{pi}{3} ).I remember that the area of a triangle can be given by ( frac{1}{2}absin C ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the sides adjacent to angle ( C ). So, if I can express the area in terms of ( a ) and ( b ), and then find its maximum, that should work.But to do that, I might need a relationship between sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). The Law of Cosines relates these: ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C ).Given that ( c = sqrt{3} ) and ( C = frac{pi}{3} ), let's plug these into the Law of Cosines:( (sqrt{3})^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) )Simplifying:( 3 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab times frac{1}{2} )Because ( cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2} ), so:( 3 = a^2 + b^2 - ab )So, we have ( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 ).Now, our goal is to maximize the area ( S = frac{1}{2}absinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) ).Since ( sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), the area becomes:( S = frac{1}{2}ab times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}ab )So, to maximize ( S ), we need to maximize ( ab ) given the constraint ( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 ).This seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a simple quadratic constraint, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the other and then find the maximum.Alternatively, I recall that for expressions involving ( a^2 + b^2 ) and ( ab ), sometimes completing the square or using AM-GM inequality can help.Let me try to manipulate the constraint:( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 )I can rewrite this as:( a^2 - ab + b^2 = 3 )Hmm, this looks similar to ( (a - b)^2 + ab = 3 ), but let's check:( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 ), so ( a^2 - ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2 + ab ). So, yes, ( (a - b)^2 + ab = 3 ).But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe another approach.Let me consider that ( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 ). Let me think of this as a quadratic in terms of ( a ):( a^2 - b a + (b^2 - 3) = 0 )For real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:Discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4 times 1 times (b^2 - 3) geq 0 )Simplify:( D = b^2 - 4b^2 + 12 = -3b^2 + 12 geq 0 )So,( -3b^2 + 12 geq 0 )( 3b^2 leq 12 )( b^2 leq 4 )( |b| leq 2 )Since ( b ) is a length, it must be positive, so ( 0 < b leq 2 ).Similarly, if we treat the equation as a quadratic in ( b ), we would get ( 0 < a leq 2 ).So, both ( a ) and ( b ) are at most 2.But how does this help me maximize ( ab )?Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of substitution. Let me set ( a = b ) to see if that gives a maximum.If ( a = b ), then the constraint becomes:( a^2 + a^2 - a^2 = 3 )( a^2 = 3 )( a = sqrt{3} )So, ( a = b = sqrt{3} ). Then, ( ab = 3 ).So, the area would be ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).Is this the maximum?Wait, let's see. Maybe if ( a ) and ( b ) are not equal, ( ab ) can be larger.Let me consider the constraint ( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 ). Let me try to express ( ab ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ).Alternatively, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.Let me define the function to maximize as ( f(a, b) = ab ) with the constraint ( g(a, b) = a^2 + b^2 - ab - 3 = 0 ).The Lagrangian is ( mathcal{L} = ab - lambda(a^2 + b^2 - ab - 3) ).Taking partial derivatives:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial a} = b - lambda(2a - b) = 0 )( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial b} = a - lambda(2b - a) = 0 )( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -(a^2 + b^2 - ab - 3) = 0 )So, from the first equation:( b = lambda(2a - b) )From the second equation:( a = lambda(2b - a) )Let me solve these equations.From the first equation:( b = 2lambda a - lambda b )Bring terms with ( b ) to one side:( b + lambda b = 2lambda a )( b(1 + lambda) = 2lambda a )Similarly, from the second equation:( a = 2lambda b - lambda a )Bring terms with ( a ) to one side:( a + lambda a = 2lambda b )( a(1 + lambda) = 2lambda b )So, from both equations:( b(1 + lambda) = 2lambda a ) and ( a(1 + lambda) = 2lambda b )Let me denote ( k = 1 + lambda ). Then, the equations become:( b k = 2lambda a ) and ( a k = 2lambda b )From the first equation: ( b = frac{2lambda a}{k} )From the second equation: ( a = frac{2lambda b}{k} )Substitute ( b ) from the first into the second:( a = frac{2lambda}{k} times frac{2lambda a}{k} = frac{4lambda^2 a}{k^2} )Assuming ( a neq 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( a ):( 1 = frac{4lambda^2}{k^2} )But ( k = 1 + lambda ), so:( 1 = frac{4lambda^2}{(1 + lambda)^2} )Take square roots:( 1 = frac{2lambda}{1 + lambda} )So,( 1 + lambda = 2lambda )( 1 = lambda )So, ( lambda = 1 ). Then, ( k = 1 + 1 = 2 ).Substituting back into the first equation:( b = frac{2 times 1 times a}{2} = a )So, ( a = b ). Therefore, the maximum occurs when ( a = b ).So, substituting ( a = b ) into the constraint:( a^2 + a^2 - a^2 = 3 )( a^2 = 3 )( a = sqrt{3} )So, ( a = b = sqrt{3} ). Therefore, ( ab = 3 ), and the area is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).Is this indeed the maximum? Let me check with another method to confirm.Another approach is to use the AM-GM inequality. Let me see.We have ( a^2 + b^2 - ab = 3 ). Let me consider that ( a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab ) by AM-GM. So,( 3 = a^2 + b^2 - ab geq 2ab - ab = ab )So, ( ab leq 3 ). Thus, the maximum value of ( ab ) is 3, which occurs when ( a = b ).Therefore, the maximum area is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).So, the maximum area of triangle ( ABC ) is ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).Wait, but let me think again. If ( a = b = sqrt{3} ), then triangle ( ABC ) has two sides equal to ( sqrt{3} ) and angle ( C = 60^circ ). That actually makes it an equilateral triangle because if two sides are equal and the included angle is 60 degrees, all sides must be equal.So, in that case, all sides are ( sqrt{3} ), and the area would indeed be ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times (sqrt{3})^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).Yes, that makes sense. So, the maximum area is achieved when the triangle is equilateral.Therefore, the answers are:1. The set of ( x ) where ( f(x) ) reaches its maximum is ( x = frac{pi}{3} + kpi ) for any integer ( k ).2. The maximum area of triangle ( ABC ) is ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} ).**Final Answer**(1) The set of values of ( x ) is (boxed{left{x mid x = kpi + frac{pi}{3}, k in mathbb{Z}right}}).(2) The maximum area of ( triangle ABC ) is (boxed{dfrac{3sqrt{3}}{4}})."},{"question":"If ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers for which ( frac{x^{n} - y^{n}}{x - y} ) is an integer for four consecutive positive integers ( n ), then the same holds for all positive integers ( n ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers such that ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for four consecutive positive integers ( n ), then it's an integer for all positive integers ( n ). Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out why this is true.First, let me understand what ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) represents. I remember that this is a geometric series sum. Specifically, ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + dots + y^{n-1} ). So, it's the sum of a geometric progression with ratio ( frac{y}{x} ) or ( frac{x}{y} ), depending on how you look at it.Now, the problem states that this sum is an integer for four consecutive values of ( n ). Let's denote these four consecutive integers as ( k, k+1, k+2, k+3 ). So, ( frac{x^k - y^k}{x - y} ), ( frac{x^{k+1} - y^{k+1}}{x - y} ), ( frac{x^{k+2} - y^{k+2}}{x - y} ), and ( frac{x^{k+3} - y^{k+3}}{x - y} ) are all integers.I need to show that this implies ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for all positive integers ( n ). Maybe I can use some sort of induction here? If I can show that if it's true for ( n ) and ( n+1 ), then it's true for ( n+2 ), and so on, that might work.But before that, maybe I should explore the properties of ( x ) and ( y ). Since ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for four consecutive ( n ), perhaps ( x ) and ( y ) have some special properties, like being integers themselves or roots of unity or something?Wait, ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers, so roots of unity might not be the right direction. Maybe they are integers? If ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would indeed be an integer because it's the sum of integers. But the problem doesn't state that ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, just that the expression is an integer for four consecutive ( n ).So, perhaps ( x ) and ( y ) are algebraic numbers or something? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can think about the recurrence relation for ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ). Let me define ( a_n ) as such.So, ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ). Then, I can write a recurrence relation for ( a_n ). Let's see:( a_{n+1} = frac{x^{n+1} - y^{n+1}}{x - y} ).But ( x^{n+1} = x cdot x^n ) and ( y^{n+1} = y cdot y^n ). So,( a_{n+1} = frac{x cdot x^n - y cdot y^n}{x - y} = frac{x cdot (x^n - y^n) + y cdot (x^n - y^n) - y cdot (x^n - y^n)}{x - y} ).Wait, that seems convoluted. Maybe another approach. I recall that for such expressions, there's a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, ( a_{n+2} = (x + y) a_{n+1} - xy a_n ). Let me verify that.Starting with ( a_{n+2} = frac{x^{n+2} - y^{n+2}}{x - y} ).We can factor ( x^{n+2} - y^{n+2} = (x + y)(x^{n+1} - y^{n+1}) - xy(x^n - y^n) ).Yes, that seems right. So,( a_{n+2} = frac{(x + y)(x^{n+1} - y^{n+1}) - xy(x^n - y^n)}{x - y} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xy a_n ).So, the recurrence relation is ( a_{n+2} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xy a_n ).Okay, so if I can show that ( a_n ) is an integer for all ( n ) given that it's an integer for four consecutive ( n ), then I can use this recurrence relation.Suppose ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers. Then, using the recurrence, ( a_{k+4} = (x + y)a_{k+3} - xy a_{k+2} ). If ( a_{k+3} ) and ( a_{k+2} ) are integers, then ( a_{k+4} ) would be an integer if ( (x + y) ) and ( xy ) are rational numbers, right? Because if ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are rational, then multiplying by integers and subtracting would give integers.Wait, but ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers. So, if ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are rational, then ( x ) and ( y ) are roots of the quadratic equation ( t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0 ), which has rational coefficients. So, ( x ) and ( y ) are either both rational or conjugate irrationals.But if ( x ) and ( y ) are conjugate irrationals, like ( a + sqrt{b} ) and ( a - sqrt{b} ), then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would still be an integer if ( a ) and ( b ) are such that the expression simplifies to an integer.Wait, but how does this help me? Maybe I need to show that ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are integers, not just rational.Because if ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are integers, then the recurrence relation would ensure that all ( a_n ) are integers, given that the initial terms are integers.So, perhaps I can show that ( x + y ) and ( xy ) must be integers.Given that ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers, can I deduce that ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are integers?Let me think about the determinant of a matrix formed by these terms. Maybe using the fact that four consecutive terms are integers, I can set up equations to solve for ( x + y ) and ( xy ).Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that ( a_n ) satisfies a linear recurrence of order 2, so if four consecutive terms are integers, then the coefficients of the recurrence must be rational, and perhaps integers.Wait, from the recurrence ( a_{n+2} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xy a_n ), if ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers, then:( a_{k+2} = (x + y)a_{k+1} - xy a_k )( a_{k+3} = (x + y)a_{k+2} - xy a_{k+1} )So, these are two equations with two unknowns ( x + y ) and ( xy ). Let me denote ( s = x + y ) and ( p = xy ). Then, the equations become:1. ( a_{k+2} = s a_{k+1} - p a_k )2. ( a_{k+3} = s a_{k+2} - p a_{k+1} )So, we can write this as a system:( s a_{k+1} - p a_k = a_{k+2} )( s a_{k+2} - p a_{k+1} = a_{k+3} )This is a linear system in variables ( s ) and ( p ). Let me write it in matrix form:[begin{pmatrix}a_{k+1} & -a_k a_{k+2} & -a_{k+1}end{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix}s pend{pmatrix}=begin{pmatrix}a_{k+2} a_{k+3}end{pmatrix}]So, to solve for ( s ) and ( p ), I can compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:( D = a_{k+1}(-a_{k+1}) - (-a_k)(a_{k+2}) = -a_{k+1}^2 + a_k a_{k+2} )If ( D neq 0 ), then the system has a unique solution:( s = frac{a_{k+2}(-a_{k+1}) - a_{k+3}(-a_k)}{D} = frac{-a_{k+2}a_{k+1} + a_{k+3}a_k}{D} )( p = frac{a_{k+1}a_{k+3} - a_{k+2}^2}{D} )Wait, let me compute ( s ) and ( p ):Using Cramer's rule:( s = frac{begin{vmatrix} a_{k+2} & -a_k  a_{k+3} & -a_{k+1} end{vmatrix}}{D} = frac{a_{k+2}(-a_{k+1}) - (-a_k)a_{k+3}}{D} = frac{-a_{k+2}a_{k+1} + a_k a_{k+3}}{D} )Similarly,( p = frac{begin{vmatrix} a_{k+1} & a_{k+2}  a_{k+2} & a_{k+3} end{vmatrix}}{D} = frac{a_{k+1}a_{k+3} - a_{k+2}^2}{D} )So, ( s ) and ( p ) are expressed in terms of ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ). Since ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers, ( s ) and ( p ) must be rational numbers because they are expressed as ratios of integers.But ( s = x + y ) and ( p = xy ). So, ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are rational. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) are roots of the quadratic equation ( t^2 - s t + p = 0 ), which has rational coefficients. Hence, ( x ) and ( y ) are either both rational or conjugate irrational numbers.But wait, if ( x ) and ( y ) are conjugate irrationals, say ( a + sqrt{b} ) and ( a - sqrt{b} ), then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would be an integer only if ( b ) is a perfect square, making ( x ) and ( y ) rational. Otherwise, the expression might not be an integer.Hmm, so perhaps ( x ) and ( y ) must actually be rational numbers. Because if they were irrational conjugates, the expression might not necessarily be an integer for all ( n ), unless the irrational parts cancel out, which would require ( b ) to be a perfect square, making them rational.Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) must be rational numbers. But since ( s = x + y ) and ( p = xy ) are rational, and ( x ) and ( y ) are roots of ( t^2 - s t + p = 0 ), which has rational coefficients, then ( x ) and ( y ) are either both rational or irrational conjugates.But given that ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for four consecutive ( n ), and we've deduced that ( s ) and ( p ) are rational, perhaps ( x ) and ( y ) must actually be integers. Because if ( x ) and ( y ) are rational, say ( x = frac{a}{b} ) and ( y = frac{c}{d} ), then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would involve denominators ( b^n ) and ( d^n ), which would complicate things unless ( b = d = 1 ), making ( x ) and ( y ) integers.Wait, let's think about that. Suppose ( x = frac{a}{b} ) and ( y = frac{c}{d} ) in lowest terms. Then, ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} = frac{frac{a^n}{b^n} - frac{c^n}{d^n}}{frac{a}{b} - frac{c}{d}} = frac{frac{a^n d^n - c^n b^n}{b^n d^n}}{frac{a d - c b}{b d}} = frac{a^n d^n - c^n b^n}{b^n d^n} cdot frac{b d}{a d - c b} = frac{(a d)^n - (c b)^n}{(a d - c b) b^{n-1} d^{n-1}}} ).For this to be an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator. But unless ( b = d = 1 ), the denominator would have factors of ( b ) and ( d ), which might not divide the numerator unless ( a ) and ( c ) are multiples of ( b ) and ( d ), respectively, which would contradict the fractions being in lowest terms.Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) must be integers. So, ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, and ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for all ( n ), because it's the sum of integers.Wait, but the problem didn't state that ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, just that the expression is an integer for four consecutive ( n ). So, perhaps I can conclude that ( x ) and ( y ) must be integers, given that the expression is an integer for four consecutive ( n ).But how do I formalize that? Maybe by using the fact that if ( x ) and ( y ) are rational, then they must be integers because the denominators would have to divide the expression for all ( n ), which is only possible if the denominators are 1.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that ( x ) and ( y ) satisfy a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, hence they are algebraic integers, and since they are real, they must be rational integers.Wait, algebraic integers are roots of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. If ( x ) and ( y ) satisfy ( t^2 - s t + p = 0 ) with ( s ) and ( p ) integers, then they are algebraic integers. But real algebraic integers are either rational or irrational. But if they are irrational, then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) might not be an integer, unless the irrational parts cancel out, which would require ( x ) and ( y ) to be conjugate algebraic integers, but in that case, the expression would still be an algebraic integer, but not necessarily a rational integer.Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me consider specific cases. Suppose ( x ) and ( y ) are integers. Then, ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is clearly an integer for all ( n ), as it's the sum of integers. So, if ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, the statement holds.But the problem is the converse: if ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for four consecutive ( n ), then ( x ) and ( y ) must be integers, hence the expression is an integer for all ( n ).Wait, but how do I know that ( x ) and ( y ) must be integers? Maybe they could be roots of unity, but since they are real, the only roots of unity are 1 and -1. But if ( x ) and ( y ) are 1 and -1, then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would be 1 for all ( n ), which is an integer. But that's a specific case.Alternatively, maybe ( x ) and ( y ) are both 0, but that would make the expression undefined because ( x - y = 0 ). So, that's not possible.Wait, another thought: if ( x ) and ( y ) are such that ( x - y ) divides ( x^n - y^n ) for four consecutive ( n ), then perhaps ( x - y ) must be 1 or -1, making ( x ) and ( y ) consecutive integers. But that might not necessarily be the case.Alternatively, maybe ( x ) and ( y ) are both 1, but then the expression is undefined as well.Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the properties of the sequence ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ). Since it's a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients, and if four consecutive terms are integers, then all terms must be integers.Wait, that might be the key. If a linear recurrence with constant coefficients has enough consecutive integer terms, then all terms must be integers. Is that a theorem?Yes, I think so. If a linear recurrence sequence has integer terms for sufficiently many consecutive terms, then all terms are integers. The number of required consecutive terms depends on the order of the recurrence. For a second-order recurrence, four consecutive terms might be sufficient.Wait, actually, for a linear recurrence of order ( k ), if ( k ) consecutive terms are integers, then all terms are integers, provided the recurrence has constant coefficients and the characteristic polynomial has integer coefficients.In our case, the recurrence is ( a_{n+2} = s a_{n+1} - p a_n ), where ( s ) and ( p ) are integers (as we deduced earlier). So, if four consecutive terms are integers, then the recurrence ensures that all subsequent terms are integers.Wait, but actually, for a second-order linear recurrence, if two consecutive terms are integers, and the coefficients are integers, then all terms are integers. Because each term is a linear combination of the previous two with integer coefficients.So, in our case, if ( a_k ) and ( a_{k+1} ) are integers, and the recurrence has integer coefficients ( s ) and ( p ), then ( a_{k+2} ) is an integer, and so on. Therefore, if four consecutive terms are integers, then certainly ( a_k ) and ( a_{k+1} ) are integers, and hence all subsequent terms are integers.But wait, in our case, we have four consecutive terms, which is more than enough to ensure that the recurrence can generate all future terms as integers. So, perhaps the key is that if four consecutive terms are integers, then the recurrence coefficients must be integers, and hence all terms are integers.But how do we know that the coefficients ( s ) and ( p ) are integers? Earlier, I thought they were rational, but maybe they must be integers.Let me revisit that. From the system of equations:( a_{k+2} = s a_{k+1} - p a_k )( a_{k+3} = s a_{k+2} - p a_{k+1} )We solved for ( s ) and ( p ) and found that they are rational numbers because ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers. So, ( s ) and ( p ) are rational.But if ( s ) and ( p ) are rational, then the recurrence has rational coefficients. However, for the recurrence to produce integer terms from integer initial terms, the coefficients must be integers. Otherwise, the terms could become fractions.Wait, but in our case, the initial terms ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3} ) are integers, and the recurrence is ( a_{n+2} = s a_{n+1} - p a_n ). If ( s ) and ( p ) are rational, then ( a_{n+2} ) would be a linear combination of integers with rational coefficients, which might not necessarily be integers unless the coefficients are integers.Therefore, for ( a_{n+2} ) to be an integer, given that ( a_{n+1} ) and ( a_n ) are integers, ( s ) and ( p ) must be integers. Because if ( s ) or ( p ) had a fractional part, multiplying by an integer could result in a non-integer, which would contradict ( a_{n+2} ) being an integer.Therefore, ( s ) and ( p ) must be integers. Hence, ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are integers.So, ( x ) and ( y ) are roots of the quadratic equation ( t^2 - s t + p = 0 ), where ( s ) and ( p ) are integers. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) are algebraic integers. But since they are real, they must be rational integers or irrational conjugates.But if they are irrational conjugates, then ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) would be an algebraic integer, but not necessarily a rational integer. However, the problem states that it is an integer, meaning a rational integer. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) must be rational integers.Hence, ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, and ( frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ) is an integer for all positive integers ( n ).So, putting it all together:1. Define ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ).2. Show that ( a_n ) satisfies the recurrence ( a_{n+2} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xy a_n ).3. Given four consecutive integer terms, set up the system to solve for ( x + y ) and ( xy ), which must be integers.4. Conclude that ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, hence ( a_n ) is an integer for all ( n ).I think that covers it. Maybe I should check with specific numbers to see if this makes sense.Suppose ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ). Then, ( frac{2^n - 1^n}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1 ), which is clearly an integer for all ( n ). Now, suppose ( x = sqrt{2} ) and ( y = -sqrt{2} ). Then, ( frac{(sqrt{2})^n - (-sqrt{2})^n}{sqrt{2} - (-sqrt{2})} ). For even ( n ), this would be ( frac{2^{n/2} - 2^{n/2}}{2sqrt{2}} = 0 ), which is an integer. For odd ( n ), it would be ( frac{2^{(n-1)/2} sqrt{2} - (-2^{(n-1)/2} sqrt{2})}{2sqrt{2}} = frac{2 cdot 2^{(n-1)/2} sqrt{2}}{2sqrt{2}} = 2^{(n-1)/2} ), which is an integer if ( n ) is odd. But wait, for ( n = 1 ), it's ( 1 ), for ( n = 3 ), it's ( 2 ), for ( n = 5 ), it's ( 4 ), etc. So, it is an integer for all ( n ). But in this case, ( x + y = 0 ) and ( xy = -2 ), which are integers. So, even though ( x ) and ( y ) are irrational, the expression is an integer for all ( n ).Wait, but in this case, ( x + y = 0 ) and ( xy = -2 ), so the recurrence is ( a_{n+2} = 0 cdot a_{n+1} - (-2) a_n = 2 a_n ). So, ( a_{n+2} = 2 a_n ). Given that ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 0 ), ( a_3 = 2 ), ( a_4 = 0 ), ( a_5 = 4 ), etc. So, it alternates between 0 and powers of 2. So, it is indeed an integer for all ( n ).But in this case, ( x ) and ( y ) are not integers, but the expression is still an integer for all ( n ). So, my earlier conclusion that ( x ) and ( y ) must be integers might not hold. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, but in this case, ( x + y = 0 ) and ( xy = -2 ), which are integers, so the recurrence has integer coefficients, and hence the sequence ( a_n ) is integer for all ( n ), even though ( x ) and ( y ) are not integers.So, perhaps the conclusion is that ( x + y ) and ( xy ) must be integers, which ensures that the recurrence has integer coefficients, and hence ( a_n ) is integer for all ( n ), regardless of whether ( x ) and ( y ) are integers or not.Therefore, the key is that ( x + y ) and ( xy ) are integers, which makes the recurrence have integer coefficients, ensuring that all ( a_n ) are integers, given that four consecutive terms are integers.So, to summarize:1. Define ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ).2. Show that ( a_n ) satisfies the recurrence ( a_{n+2} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xy a_n ).3. Given four consecutive integer terms, solve for ( x + y ) and ( xy ), which must be integers.4. Conclude that the recurrence has integer coefficients, hence all ( a_n ) are integers.Therefore, the original statement is true."},{"question":"ABC is a triangle with ( AB = 33 ), ( AC = 21 ), and ( BC = m ), an integer. There are points D and E on the sides AB and AC, respectively, such that ( AD = DE = EC = n ), an integer. Find ( m ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of side BC in triangle ABC. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.\\"ABC is a triangle with AB = 33, AC = 21, and BC = m, an integer. There are points D and E on the sides AB and AC, respectively, such that AD = DE = EC = n, an integer. Find m.\\"Alright, so triangle ABC has sides AB = 33, AC = 21, and BC = m, which is an integer. Points D and E are on AB and AC such that AD = DE = EC = n, and n is also an integer. I need to find the value of m.Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC, with AB being the longest side at 33 units, AC being 21 units, and BC is the side we need to find, which is m. Points D and E are on AB and AC respectively, and the segments AD, DE, and EC are all equal to n. So, starting from A, we have AD = n on AB, then from D to E is another n, and from E to C is another n. That means AC is divided into two parts: AE and EC, where EC = n, so AE must be AC - EC = 21 - n.Wait, so AE = 21 - n and EC = n. Similarly, AD = n, so since AB is 33, then DB must be AB - AD = 33 - n.Hmm, okay. So, AD = n, DB = 33 - n, AE = 21 - n, and EC = n. Also, DE = n. So, triangle ADE has sides AD = n, AE = 21 - n, and DE = n. That seems interesting because two sides are equal, so triangle ADE is isosceles with AD = DE.Wait, no. AD = n, DE = n, so actually, triangle ADE is isosceles with AD = DE. So, sides AD and DE are equal, each of length n, and the base is AE, which is 21 - n. So, in triangle ADE, we have two sides equal and the base is 21 - n.I think I can use the Law of Cosines here. Let me recall that the Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, opposite angles A, B, and C respectively, c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ - 2ab cos(C). So, maybe I can apply this to triangle ADE.In triangle ADE, sides AD and DE are both n, and side AE is 21 - n. So, applying the Law of Cosines to triangle ADE:DE¬≤ = AD¬≤ + AE¬≤ - 2 * AD * AE * cos(angle at A)But DE is n, AD is n, and AE is 21 - n. So:n¬≤ = n¬≤ + (21 - n)¬≤ - 2 * n * (21 - n) * cos(angle at A)Let me write that equation out:n¬≤ = n¬≤ + (21 - n)¬≤ - 2n(21 - n) cos(A)Simplify this equation. First, subtract n¬≤ from both sides:0 = (21 - n)¬≤ - 2n(21 - n) cos(A)So, (21 - n)¬≤ = 2n(21 - n) cos(A)Assuming that 21 - n ‚â† 0, which it can't be because n is a positive integer less than 21 (since EC = n and AC = 21), so we can divide both sides by (21 - n):21 - n = 2n cos(A)So, cos(A) = (21 - n) / (2n)Okay, so we have an expression for cos(A) in terms of n.Now, let's consider triangle ABC. We can also apply the Law of Cosines to triangle ABC to find BC, which is m.In triangle ABC, sides AB = 33, AC = 21, and BC = m. So, applying the Law of Cosines:m¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AC¬≤ - 2 * AB * AC * cos(A)Substituting the known values:m¬≤ = 33¬≤ + 21¬≤ - 2 * 33 * 21 * cos(A)Calculating 33¬≤ and 21¬≤:33¬≤ = 108921¬≤ = 441So, m¬≤ = 1089 + 441 - 2 * 33 * 21 * cos(A)Adding 1089 and 441:1089 + 441 = 1530So, m¬≤ = 1530 - 2 * 33 * 21 * cos(A)Calculating 2 * 33 * 21:2 * 33 = 6666 * 21 = 1386So, m¬≤ = 1530 - 1386 cos(A)But from earlier, we have cos(A) = (21 - n) / (2n). Let's substitute that into the equation:m¬≤ = 1530 - 1386 * (21 - n) / (2n)Simplify this expression:First, 1386 divided by 2 is 693, so:m¬≤ = 1530 - 693 * (21 - n) / nLet me write it as:m¬≤ = 1530 - (693 * (21 - n)) / nTo make this easier, let's combine the terms:m¬≤ = 1530 - (693 * 21 - 693n) / nBreaking it down:693 * 21 = 14553So, m¬≤ = 1530 - (14553 - 693n) / nWhich can be written as:m¬≤ = 1530 - 14553 / n + 693n / nSimplify 693n / n = 693So, m¬≤ = 1530 - 14553 / n + 693Combine the constants:1530 + 693 = 2223So, m¬≤ = 2223 - 14553 / nTherefore, m¬≤ = 2223 - (14553 / n)Since m is an integer, m¬≤ must be an integer as well. Therefore, 14553 / n must be an integer because 2223 is an integer. So, n must be a divisor of 14553.Let me find the divisors of 14553. First, let's factorize 14553.14553 √∑ 3 = 48514851 √∑ 3 = 16171617 √∑ 3 = 539539 √∑ 7 = 7777 √∑ 7 = 1111 is a prime number.So, the prime factorization of 14553 is 3¬≥ √ó 7¬≤ √ó 11.Therefore, the divisors of 14553 are all the products of these primes raised to powers less than or equal to their exponents in the factorization.So, the exponents for 3 are 0, 1, 2, 3For 7: 0, 1, 2For 11: 0, 1So, the total number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4*3*2 = 24 divisors.But since n must be less than 21 (because EC = n and AC = 21), n can only be a divisor of 14553 that is less than 21.Let me list the possible divisors of 14553 that are less than 21.Starting from the smallest:1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, etc.But since n must be less than 21, possible values are 1, 3, 7, 9, 11.But n must be at least 1, but also, EC = n, so n must be less than 21, which is already considered.But let's check if these values make sense in the context.First, n cannot be 1 because if n=1, then EC=1, which would make AE=20, and DE=1. But in triangle ADE, sides AD=1, DE=1, and AE=20. That would make triangle ADE very \\"flat,\\" but let's see if it's possible.But let's check the equation for cos(A):cos(A) = (21 - n)/(2n)If n=1, cos(A) = (21 - 1)/(2*1) = 20/2 = 10. But cosine cannot be more than 1, so that's impossible. So n=1 is invalid.Next, n=3:cos(A) = (21 - 3)/(2*3) = 18/6 = 3. Again, cosine cannot be more than 1, so n=3 is invalid.Wait, that's a problem. Let me check my earlier steps.Wait, when n=3, cos(A) = (21 - 3)/(2*3) = 18/6 = 3. That's impossible because cosine can't exceed 1. So n=3 is invalid.Similarly, n=7:cos(A) = (21 - 7)/(2*7) = 14/14 = 1. So cos(A) = 1, which means angle A is 0 degrees, which is impossible in a triangle. So n=7 is invalid.Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, if n=7, then cos(A) = (21 - 7)/(2*7) = 14/14 = 1. So angle A would be 0 degrees, which is impossible because that would mean points A, B, and C are colinear, making the triangle degenerate. So n=7 is invalid.Next, n=9:cos(A) = (21 - 9)/(2*9) = 12/18 = 2/3. That's valid because 2/3 is less than 1.Similarly, n=11:cos(A) = (21 - 11)/(2*11) = 10/22 = 5/11. That's also valid.n=21 would give cos(A) = (21 - 21)/(2*21) = 0/42 = 0, which would mean angle A is 90 degrees, but n=21 is equal to AC, which would mean E is at C, but EC = n=21, which would make E coincide with C, but DE would also be 21, but D would be at A, so DE would be AC, which is 21. But in that case, AD=21, which is less than AB=33, so D would be somewhere on AB, but E would be at C. So, that might be a possible case, but n=21 is equal to AC, which is 21, so EC=21 would mean E is at C, which is allowed, but let's see.But n=21 would make AE=0, which is not possible because E would coincide with A, but EC=21 would mean E is at C, so that's a contradiction. So n=21 is invalid.So, the possible values of n are 9 and 11.Let me check n=9 first.If n=9, then cos(A) = 2/3.Then, m¬≤ = 2223 - 14553 / 9.Calculate 14553 / 9:14553 √∑ 9 = 1617.So, m¬≤ = 2223 - 1617 = 606.But 606 is not a perfect square. Let me check:24¬≤ = 57625¬≤ = 625So, 606 is between 24¬≤ and 25¬≤, not a perfect square. Therefore, m¬≤=606 is not a perfect square, so m is not an integer in this case. Therefore, n=9 is invalid.Next, n=11.cos(A) = 5/11.Then, m¬≤ = 2223 - 14553 / 11.Calculate 14553 √∑ 11:14553 √∑ 11 = 1323.So, m¬≤ = 2223 - 1323 = 900.900 is a perfect square because 30¬≤ = 900.So, m=30.Wait, but let me check if this makes sense.If m=30, then in triangle ABC, sides are AB=33, AC=21, BC=30.Let me check the triangle inequality:AB + AC > BC: 33 + 21 = 54 > 30 ‚úîÔ∏èAB + BC > AC: 33 + 30 = 63 > 21 ‚úîÔ∏èAC + BC > AB: 21 + 30 = 51 > 33 ‚úîÔ∏èSo, all triangle inequalities are satisfied.But wait, earlier when I considered n=7, I got m=12, but that led to a degenerate triangle because cos(A)=1, which is impossible. So, n=7 is invalid.Similarly, n=9 gave m¬≤=606, which is not a perfect square, so invalid.n=11 gives m=30, which is valid.Wait, but earlier when I considered n=7, I got m=12, but that led to a degenerate triangle. Let me check that again.If n=7, then cos(A)=1, which would mean angle A is 0 degrees, making AB and AC colinear, which would make BC=AB - AC=33-21=12. But that's a degenerate triangle, which is not allowed. So, n=7 is invalid.Similarly, n=3 and n=1 lead to cos(A) >1, which is impossible.n=9 gives m¬≤=606, which is not a perfect square, so invalid.n=11 gives m=30, which is valid.Therefore, the only valid solution is m=30.Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for n=11.cos(A)=5/11.Then, in triangle ABC, m¬≤=33¬≤ +21¬≤ -2*33*21*(5/11)Calculate each term:33¬≤=108921¬≤=4412*33*21=13861386*(5/11)=1386/11 *5=126*5=630So, m¬≤=1089 +441 -630=1530 -630=900Yes, m¬≤=900, so m=30.That's correct.So, the value of m is 30.**Final Answer**boxed{30}"},{"question":"Points ( E ) and ( F ) are chosen on the sides ( BC ) and ( CD ) of the square ( ABCD ) such that the angle ( EAF ) is ( 45^circ ). The side length of the square is 1. Find the perimeter of the triangle ( CEF ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about a square ABCD with side length 1. Points E and F are on sides BC and CD respectively, and the angle EAF is 45 degrees. I need to find the perimeter of triangle CEF. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.First, let me visualize the square. Let's say square ABCD has points A, B, C, D in clockwise order. So, A is at the top-left, B at the top-right, C at the bottom-right, and D at the bottom-left. That way, sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are each of length 1.Points E and F are on BC and CD respectively. So, E is somewhere along the side from B to C, and F is somewhere along the side from C to D. The angle EAF is 45 degrees. So, if I imagine point A, and then draw lines from A to E and from A to F, the angle between those two lines at A is 45 degrees.I need to find the perimeter of triangle CEF. That means I need to find the lengths of CE, EF, and FC, and then add them up. Wait, no, triangle CEF has sides CE, EF, and FC? Wait, no, triangle CEF would have sides CE, EF, and FC? Wait, hold on, C is a common point, so sides are CE, CF, and EF. Wait, no, CEF is a triangle with vertices at C, E, and F. So, the sides are CE, EF, and FC. But FC is the same as CF, so it's CE, EF, and FC. So, I need the lengths of CE, EF, and FC.But I don't know where exactly E and F are on BC and CD. So, I need to find their positions such that angle EAF is 45 degrees. Hmm.Maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the square. Let me place point A at (0,1), B at (1,1), C at (1,0), and D at (0,0). So, side AB is from (0,1) to (1,1), BC from (1,1) to (1,0), CD from (1,0) to (0,0), and DA from (0,0) to (0,1).So, point E is on BC, which is the vertical side from (1,1) to (1,0). Let me denote point E as (1, e), where e is between 0 and 1. Similarly, point F is on CD, which is the horizontal side from (1,0) to (0,0). Let me denote point F as (f, 0), where f is between 0 and 1.Now, angle EAF is 45 degrees. Point A is at (0,1). So, vectors AE and AF make a 45-degree angle. Let's find the vectors AE and AF.Vector AE goes from A(0,1) to E(1,e). So, the vector is (1-0, e-1) = (1, e-1).Vector AF goes from A(0,1) to F(f,0). So, the vector is (f-0, 0-1) = (f, -1).The angle between vectors AE and AF is 45 degrees. The formula for the angle Œ∏ between two vectors u and v is:cosŒ∏ = (u ¬∑ v) / (|u| |v|)So, cos45¬∞ = (AE ¬∑ AF) / (|AE| |AF|)Let's compute the dot product AE ¬∑ AF:(1)(f) + (e - 1)(-1) = f - (e - 1) = f - e + 1Now, |AE| is the magnitude of vector AE:‚àö(1¬≤ + (e - 1)¬≤) = ‚àö(1 + (1 - e)¬≤) = ‚àö(1 + (1 - 2e + e¬≤)) = ‚àö(2 - 2e + e¬≤)Similarly, |AF| is the magnitude of vector AF:‚àö(f¬≤ + (-1)¬≤) = ‚àö(f¬≤ + 1)So, putting it all together:cos45¬∞ = (f - e + 1) / (‚àö(2 - 2e + e¬≤) * ‚àö(f¬≤ + 1))We know that cos45¬∞ = ‚àö2 / 2 ‚âà 0.7071So,‚àö2 / 2 = (f - e + 1) / (‚àö(2 - 2e + e¬≤) * ‚àö(f¬≤ + 1))Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Wait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry with some reflections or something. I remember that sometimes in geometry problems involving angles, reflecting points can help.Let me think. If I reflect point D over line AF, and then reflect the result over line AE, maybe I can find some symmetry or something.Wait, point D is at (0,0). If I reflect D over AF, which is the line from A(0,1) to F(f,0). The reflection of D over AF would be a point D'. Then reflecting D' over AE would give me another point D''.But I'm not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I should try another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use the property that in a square, certain triangles are similar or congruent.Wait, let's consider triangle AEF. It has angle at A of 45 degrees. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Cosines here.But I don't know the lengths of AE and AF, so that might not help directly.Wait, maybe I can parameterize the positions of E and F.Let me denote E as (1, e) and F as (f, 0) as before.Then, the vectors AE = (1, e - 1) and AF = (f, -1).The angle between them is 45 degrees, so:AE ¬∑ AF = |AE| |AF| cos45¬∞Which gives:f - e + 1 = |AE| |AF| (‚àö2 / 2)We already have expressions for |AE| and |AF|.So,f - e + 1 = (‚àö(2 - 2e + e¬≤)) * (‚àö(f¬≤ + 1)) * (‚àö2 / 2)This seems messy, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.Let me denote LHS = f - e + 1RHS = (‚àö(2 - 2e + e¬≤)) * (‚àö(f¬≤ + 1)) * (‚àö2 / 2)So,LHS¬≤ = (f - e + 1)¬≤RHS¬≤ = (2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ + 1)(2 / 4) = (2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ + 1)(1/2)So,(f - e + 1)¬≤ = (2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ + 1)(1/2)Multiply both sides by 2:2(f - e + 1)¬≤ = (2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ + 1)Let me expand both sides.Left side:2(f - e + 1)¬≤ = 2[(f - e)¬≤ + 2(f - e)(1) + 1¬≤] = 2[(f¬≤ - 2ef + e¬≤) + 2f - 2e + 1] = 2f¬≤ - 4ef + 2e¬≤ + 4f - 4e + 2Right side:(2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ + 1) = 2(f¬≤ + 1) - 2e(f¬≤ + 1) + e¬≤(f¬≤ + 1) = 2f¬≤ + 2 - 2e f¬≤ - 2e + e¬≤ f¬≤ + e¬≤So, right side is:2f¬≤ + 2 - 2e f¬≤ - 2e + e¬≤ f¬≤ + e¬≤Now, set left side equal to right side:2f¬≤ - 4ef + 2e¬≤ + 4f - 4e + 2 = 2f¬≤ + 2 - 2e f¬≤ - 2e + e¬≤ f¬≤ + e¬≤Let me subtract right side from both sides to bring everything to left:[2f¬≤ - 4ef + 2e¬≤ + 4f - 4e + 2] - [2f¬≤ + 2 - 2e f¬≤ - 2e + e¬≤ f¬≤ + e¬≤] = 0Simplify term by term:2f¬≤ - 2f¬≤ = 0-4ef - (-2e f¬≤) = -4ef + 2e f¬≤2e¬≤ - e¬≤ = e¬≤4f - 0 = 4f-4e - (-2e) = -4e + 2e = -2e2 - 2 = 0So, putting it all together:-4ef + 2e f¬≤ + e¬≤ + 4f - 2e = 0Let me rearrange terms:2e f¬≤ - 4ef + e¬≤ + 4f - 2e = 0Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of f, but it's still quite complicated.Maybe I can factor this equation or find a relationship between e and f.Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or a specific position where E and F are located such that angle EAF is 45 degrees.Wait, maybe E and F are midpoints? Let me check.If E is the midpoint of BC, then E is at (1, 0.5). Similarly, if F is the midpoint of CD, then F is at (0.5, 0).Let me compute the angle EAF in this case.Vectors AE = (1, -0.5) and AF = (0.5, -1)Compute the dot product:(1)(0.5) + (-0.5)(-1) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1Compute |AE| = sqrt(1¬≤ + (-0.5)¬≤) = sqrt(1 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.25) ‚âà 1.118Compute |AF| = sqrt(0.5¬≤ + (-1)¬≤) = sqrt(0.25 + 1) = sqrt(1.25) ‚âà 1.118So, cosŒ∏ = 1 / (1.118 * 1.118) ‚âà 1 / 1.25 ‚âà 0.8Which is cosŒ∏ ‚âà 0.8, so Œ∏ ‚âà 36.87 degrees, which is less than 45 degrees. So, angle EAF is less than 45 degrees when E and F are midpoints. So, E and F must be closer to point C to make the angle larger.Hmm, so maybe E is closer to C on BC, and F is closer to C on CD.Alternatively, perhaps E and F are such that AE and AF are symmetric in some way.Wait, maybe if I consider that triangle AEF is an isosceles right triangle, but I don't know.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in square ABCD, the diagonals intersect at 45 degrees, but I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: since angle EAF is 45 degrees, and point A is a corner of the square, maybe the lines AE and AF are such that they form a 45-degree angle, which could mean that they are symmetric with respect to the diagonal of the square.But the square has two diagonals: AC and BD. The diagonal AC goes from A(0,1) to C(1,0), which is the main diagonal, and BD goes from B(1,1) to D(0,0).Wait, if I consider the diagonal AC, which has a slope of -1, and angle of 45 degrees downward from A.If angle EAF is 45 degrees, perhaps lines AE and AF are symmetric with respect to the diagonal AC.So, if I reflect one line over AC, it would coincide with the other.Hmm, that might be a way to find E and F.Let me try that.So, suppose that line AE is reflected over AC to get line AF.Since AC is the line y = -x + 1 in this coordinate system.Wait, actually, the diagonal AC goes from (0,1) to (1,0), so its equation is y = -x + 1.Reflecting line AE over AC would give line AF.So, if I can find the reflection of point E over AC, it should lie on AF.Alternatively, since E is on BC, reflecting E over AC should give a point on AF.Wait, let's try to compute the reflection of point E(1, e) over the line AC: y = -x + 1.The formula for reflection over a line ax + by + c = 0 is:x' = x - 2a(ax + by + c)/(a¬≤ + b¬≤)y' = y - 2b(ax + by + c)/(a¬≤ + b¬≤)First, let's write AC in standard form: y = -x + 1 => x + y - 1 = 0. So, a = 1, b = 1, c = -1.So, reflection of point (x, y) over AC is:x' = x - 2*1*(x + y - 1)/(1 + 1) = x - (x + y - 1)Similarly,y' = y - 2*1*(x + y - 1)/(1 + 1) = y - (x + y - 1)Simplify:x' = x - x - y + 1 = -y + 1y' = y - x - y + 1 = -x + 1So, reflection of point (x, y) over AC is (-y + 1, -x + 1)So, reflecting point E(1, e):x' = -e + 1y' = -1 + 1 = 0So, the reflection of E over AC is (1 - e, 0)Similarly, reflecting point F(f, 0):x' = -0 + 1 = 1y' = -f + 1So, reflection of F over AC is (1, 1 - f)Now, since AF is the reflection of AE over AC, the reflection of E over AC should lie on AF.So, the reflection point (1 - e, 0) should lie on AF.But AF is the line from A(0,1) to F(f, 0). So, let's find the equation of AF.The slope of AF is (0 - 1)/(f - 0) = -1/fSo, equation of AF is y - 1 = (-1/f)(x - 0) => y = (-1/f)x + 1Now, the reflection point (1 - e, 0) lies on AF, so plugging into the equation:0 = (-1/f)(1 - e) + 1So,(-1/f)(1 - e) + 1 = 0Multiply both sides by f:-(1 - e) + f = 0So,-1 + e + f = 0 => e + f = 1So, we have e + f = 1.That's a useful relationship.So, f = 1 - e.Now, going back to our earlier equation:2e f¬≤ - 4ef + e¬≤ + 4f - 2e = 0But since f = 1 - e, let's substitute f with 1 - e.So,2e(1 - e)¬≤ - 4e(1 - e) + e¬≤ + 4(1 - e) - 2e = 0Let's expand each term:First term: 2e(1 - e)¬≤= 2e(1 - 2e + e¬≤)= 2e - 4e¬≤ + 2e¬≥Second term: -4e(1 - e)= -4e + 4e¬≤Third term: e¬≤Fourth term: 4(1 - e)= 4 - 4eFifth term: -2eSo, putting it all together:(2e - 4e¬≤ + 2e¬≥) + (-4e + 4e¬≤) + e¬≤ + (4 - 4e) + (-2e) = 0Now, combine like terms:e¬≥ terms: 2e¬≥e¬≤ terms: -4e¬≤ + 4e¬≤ + e¬≤ = 1e¬≤e terms: 2e - 4e - 4e - 2e = (2 - 4 - 4 - 2)e = (-8)econstant terms: 4So, overall:2e¬≥ + e¬≤ - 8e + 4 = 0Hmm, now we have a cubic equation: 2e¬≥ + e¬≤ - 8e + 4 = 0Let me try to factor this.Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Maybe factor as quadratic in e¬≤?But e^4 -4e¬≥ +8e -4 doesn't seem to factor easily.Alternatively, maybe use substitution.Let me set u = e -1, to eliminate the cubic term.But that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.Wait, let's recap.We had e + f =1 from the reflection condition.We also had the angle condition leading to 2(f - e +1)^2 = (2 - 2e + e¬≤)(f¬≤ +1)Substituting f=1 -e into this gives:2(2 - 2e)^2 = (2 -2e + e¬≤)( (1 -e)^2 +1 )Which simplifies to:8 -16e +8e¬≤ = (2 -2e + e¬≤)^2Which leads to:8 -16e +8e¬≤ = e^4 -4e¬≥ +8e¬≤ -8e +4Then bringing everything to left:-e^4 +4e¬≥ -8e +4=0Which is same as e^4 -4e¬≥ +8e -4=0Hmm, perhaps I can factor this quartic.Let me try to factor it as (e¬≤ + a e + b)(e¬≤ + c e + d)= e^4 + (a + c)e¬≥ + (ac + b + d)e¬≤ + (ad + bc)e + bdSet equal to e^4 -4e¬≥ +0e¬≤ +8e -4So,a + c = -4ac + b + d =0ad + bc =8bd= -4Looking for integer solutions.bd=-4. Possible pairs (b,d): (1,-4), (-1,4), (2,-2), (-2,2), (4,-1), (-4,1)Let me try b=2, d=-2Then,a + c = -4ac +2 -2= ac=0So, ac=0Also, ad + bc= a*(-2) + c*2= -2a +2c=8But since ac=0, either a=0 or c=0.If a=0, then c=-4Then, ad + bc=0*(-2) + (-4)*2= -8‚â†8If c=0, then a=-4Then, ad + bc= (-4)*(-2) +0*2=8 +0=8Which matches.So, a=-4, c=0, b=2, d=-2Thus, the quartic factors as:(e¬≤ -4e +2)(e¬≤ +0e -2)= (e¬≤ -4e +2)(e¬≤ -2)So,(e¬≤ -4e +2)(e¬≤ -2)=0So, solutions are roots of e¬≤ -4e +2=0 and e¬≤ -2=0Solve e¬≤ -4e +2=0:e = [4 ¬± sqrt(16 -8)]/2 = [4 ¬± sqrt(8)]/2 = [4 ¬± 2‚àö2]/2 = 2 ¬± ‚àö2Since e is between 0 and1, 2 -‚àö2 ‚âà 0.5857 is acceptable, while 2 +‚àö2 ‚âà3.414 is too big.Solve e¬≤ -2=0:e=¬±‚àö2But e must be between 0 and1, so no solution here.Thus, the only real solution in [0,1] is e=2 -‚àö2‚âà0.5857So, e=2 -‚àö2, then f=1 -e=1 -(2 -‚àö2)=‚àö2 -1‚âà0.4142So, E is at (1, e)=(1, 2 -‚àö2)F is at (f,0)=(‚àö2 -1, 0)Now, we need to find the perimeter of triangle CEF.Points:C is at (1,0)E is at (1, 2 -‚àö2)F is at (‚àö2 -1, 0)So, sides:CE: distance from C(1,0) to E(1, 2 -‚àö2)Since x-coordinates are same, distance is |2 -‚àö2 -0|=2 -‚àö2CF: distance from C(1,0) to F(‚àö2 -1,0)Since y-coordinates are same, distance is |1 - (‚àö2 -1)|=|2 -‚àö2|EF: distance from E(1, 2 -‚àö2) to F(‚àö2 -1,0)Use distance formula:sqrt[(1 - (‚àö2 -1))¬≤ + (2 -‚àö2 -0)¬≤]Simplify:sqrt[(2 -‚àö2)¬≤ + (2 -‚àö2)¬≤] = sqrt[2*(2 -‚àö2)¬≤]= sqrt[2]*(2 -‚àö2)= (2 -‚àö2)*sqrt(2)But let's compute it step by step.First, compute (1 - (‚àö2 -1))=2 -‚àö2Similarly, (2 -‚àö2 -0)=2 -‚àö2So, distance EF= sqrt[(2 -‚àö2)^2 + (2 -‚àö2)^2] = sqrt[2*(2 -‚àö2)^2] = sqrt(2)*(2 -‚àö2)So, perimeter P= CE + EF + FCBut wait, FC is same as CF, which is |2 -‚àö2|Wait, no, CF is distance from C to F, which is |1 - (‚àö2 -1)|=2 -‚àö2Wait, but E is at (1,2 -‚àö2), so CE is vertical distance from C(1,0) to E(1,2 -‚àö2), which is 2 -‚àö2Similarly, CF is horizontal distance from C(1,0) to F(‚àö2 -1,0), which is 1 - (‚àö2 -1)=2 -‚àö2So, CE=CF=2 -‚àö2EF= sqrt(2)*(2 -‚àö2)So, perimeter P= CE + EF + FC= (2 -‚àö2) + sqrt(2)*(2 -‚àö2) + (2 -‚àö2)Wait, but FC is same as CF, which is 2 -‚àö2, so total perimeter is 2*(2 -‚àö2) + sqrt(2)*(2 -‚àö2)Factor out (2 -‚àö2):P= (2 -‚àö2)(2 + sqrt(2))= (2 -‚àö2)(2 + sqrt(2))=4 -2=2Wait, that's interesting.Because (2 -‚àö2)(2 + sqrt(2))=4 - (‚àö2)^2=4 -2=2So, perimeter P=2Wow, that's neat.So, despite the complicated positions of E and F, the perimeter of triangle CEF is 2.I think that's the answer."},{"question":"Given that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is 60^{circ}, and |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=2, find |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about vectors. It says that the angle between vectors a and b is 60 degrees, and the magnitudes are |a| = 1 and |b| = 2. I need to find the magnitude of the vector a - b. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with vectors and their magnitudes, especially when there's an angle involved, the dot product formula might come in handy. The dot product formula is |a||b|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So maybe I can use that to find some relationship between a and b.Wait, but I need to find the magnitude of a - b. I think there's a formula for the magnitude of the difference of two vectors. Let me recall. I believe it's similar to the law of cosines in triangles. Yeah, that's right. The formula is |a - b|¬≤ = |a|¬≤ + |b|¬≤ - 2|a||b|cos(theta). So, if I can compute this, I can find the magnitude.Alright, let's plug in the values. |a| is 1, so |a|¬≤ is 1¬≤ which is 1. |b| is 2, so |b|¬≤ is 2¬≤ which is 4. The angle theta is 60 degrees, so cos(theta) is cos(60¬∞). I remember that cos(60¬∞) is 0.5. So, putting it all together:|a - b|¬≤ = 1 + 4 - 2 * 1 * 2 * 0.5Let me compute each part step by step. First, 1 + 4 is 5. Then, 2 * 1 * 2 is 4, and 4 * 0.5 is 2. So, subtracting that from 5 gives 5 - 2 = 3.So, |a - b|¬≤ = 3. To find |a - b|, I need to take the square root of 3. Therefore, |a - b| is sqrt(3).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the formula: |a - b|¬≤ = |a|¬≤ + |b|¬≤ - 2|a||b|cos(theta). Plugging in the values: 1¬≤ + 2¬≤ - 2*1*2*cos(60¬∞). That's 1 + 4 - 4*0.5. 1 + 4 is 5, and 4*0.5 is 2, so 5 - 2 is 3. Square root of 3 is approximately 1.732, which seems reasonable.I think that makes sense. The vectors are at a 60-degree angle, so the difference vector should form a triangle with sides 1, 2, and sqrt(3). Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the magnitude of a - b is sqrt(3)."},{"question":"Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) that measures 5 by 6 by 7 units. Calculate the volume of this set of points, expressed as frac{m+npi}{p}, where m, n, and p are positive integers, and n and p are relatively prime. Find the value of m+n+p.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the volume of a set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular box that measures 5 by 6 by 7 units. The answer needs to be expressed in the form (m + nœÄ)/p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, and n and p are relatively prime. Then, I have to find the sum m + n + p.Okay, let me break this down. First, I need to visualize the shape we're dealing with. It's a box, and we're considering all points that are either inside the box or within one unit of its surface. So, essentially, this is like expanding the box by one unit in all directions, but I have to be careful because just expanding it uniformly would create some overlapping regions, especially at the edges and corners.I remember that when you expand a polyhedron by a certain distance, the resulting volume can be calculated by considering the original volume, the volume added by extending each face, the volume added by extending each edge, and the volume added by extending each corner. This is similar to how the volume of a 3D shape changes when you create an \\"offset\\" or \\"buffer\\" around it.So, let me recall the formula for the volume of the set of points within a distance r from a polyhedron. It's given by:Volume = Original Volume + Surface Area * r + (Perimeter of all edges) * (œÄ * r¬≤)/4 + (Number of vertices) * (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8Wait, let me think about that. Each face contributes a sort of \\"prism\\" volume when extended by r, each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder (since each edge is shared by two faces, but in 3D, each edge is adjacent to two faces, so extending each edge by r would create a quarter-cylinder around each edge), and each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere (since each vertex is where three edges meet, so extending each vertex by r would create an eighth-sphere at each corner).So, more formally, the formula is:Volume = V + S * r + L * (œÄ r¬≤)/4 + (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * CWhere:- V is the original volume,- S is the surface area,- L is the total length of all edges,- C is the number of vertices,- r is the distance we're expanding (in this case, 1 unit).Let me verify this formula. For a box, the number of vertices is 8, the number of edges is 12 (each box has 12 edges: 4 of each length corresponding to length, width, height), and the surface area is 2(lw + lh + wh).So, plugging in the values:First, let's compute each component step by step.1. Original Volume (V):   The box is 5x6x7, so V = 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 cubic units.2. Surface Area (S):   The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(lw + lh + wh).   So, S = 2(5*6 + 5*7 + 6*7) = 2(30 + 35 + 42) = 2(107) = 214 square units.3. Total Length of All Edges (L):   A rectangular box has 12 edges: 4 of each length corresponding to length, width, height.   So, L = 4*(5 + 6 + 7) = 4*(18) = 72 units.4. Number of Vertices (C):   A rectangular box has 8 vertices.5. Distance (r):   Given as 1 unit.Now, plugging these into the formula:Volume = V + S * r + L * (œÄ r¬≤)/4 + (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * CLet's compute each term:- V = 210- S * r = 214 * 1 = 214- L * (œÄ r¬≤)/4 = 72 * (œÄ * 1¬≤)/4 = 72 * œÄ /4 = 18œÄ- (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * C = (4/3 œÄ * 1¬≥)/8 * 8 = (4/3 œÄ)/8 * 8 = (4/3 œÄ) * (8/8) = 4/3 œÄWait, hold on. Let me double-check that last term. The formula is (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * C. Since C is 8, it becomes (4/3 œÄ)/8 * 8, which simplifies to 4/3 œÄ. That makes sense because each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere, and with 8 vertices, it's a full sphere.So, putting it all together:Volume = 210 + 214 + 18œÄ + (4/3)œÄLet me compute the constants and the œÄ terms separately.Constants:210 + 214 = 424œÄ terms:18œÄ + (4/3)œÄ = (54/3 + 4/3)œÄ = (58/3)œÄSo, the total volume is 424 + (58/3)œÄ.But the problem asks for the volume expressed as (m + nœÄ)/p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, and n and p are relatively prime.Hmm, so currently, I have 424 + (58/3)œÄ. To write this as a single fraction, I need to express 424 as a fraction over 3.So, 424 = 424 * (3/3) = 1272/3Therefore, the total volume is:1272/3 + 58œÄ/3 = (1272 + 58œÄ)/3So, m = 1272, n = 58, p = 3.Now, check if n and p are relatively prime. n = 58, p = 3. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 58 and 3 is 1, since 58 is 2*29 and 3 is prime. So, yes, they are relatively prime.Therefore, the expression is (1272 + 58œÄ)/3, and m + n + p = 1272 + 58 + 3.Let me compute that:1272 + 58 = 13301330 + 3 = 1333Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the formula.I used the formula:Volume = V + S*r + L*(œÄ r¬≤)/4 + (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * CBut is that correct? Let me think again.When you take a polyhedron and take all points within distance r from it, the volume is equal to the original volume plus the volume added by expanding each face, edge, and vertex.Expanding each face by r adds a volume equal to the surface area times r. That makes sense because it's like adding a layer around each face.Expanding each edge by r adds a volume equal to the length of each edge times the area of a quarter-cylinder around it. Since each edge is shared by two faces, the expansion around each edge is a quarter-cylinder, right? Wait, no, in 3D, each edge is adjacent to two faces, but when you expand the polyhedron, the region around each edge is actually a half-cylinder, not a quarter-cylinder. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.Wait, let me clarify. In 2D, when you expand a polygon, the corners contribute quarter-circles. In 3D, expanding a polyhedron, the edges contribute quarter-cylinders? Or half-cylinders?Wait, actually, in 3D, when you expand a polyhedron, each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder because each edge is where two faces meet, and the expansion around the edge is a quarter-cylinder in the direction perpendicular to the edge. Wait, no, perhaps it's a half-cylinder.Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.Imagine taking a single edge of the box. When you expand the box by one unit, the region around the edge becomes a quarter-cylinder? Or a half-cylinder?Wait, no, in 3D, the region around an edge when expanded is actually a half-cylinder. Because each edge is shared by two faces, and when you expand each face, the overlapping region around the edge is a half-cylinder.Wait, but actually, no. Let me think in terms of the Minkowski sum. When you take the Minkowski sum of a polyhedron with a ball of radius r, the volume is given by Steiner's formula, which in 3D is:Volume = V + S*r + L*(œÄ r¬≤)/4 + (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 * CWait, so according to Steiner's formula, the coefficients are 1, r, (œÄ r¬≤)/4, and (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8.So, the edge term is L*(œÄ r¬≤)/4, which would correspond to each edge contributing a quarter-cylinder. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was correct.But why is it a quarter-cylinder? Because each edge is shared by two faces, and when you expand each face, the overlapping region is a quarter-cylinder? Or perhaps because in 3D, each edge is where three faces meet, but no, in a rectangular box, each edge is where two faces meet.Wait, no, in a rectangular box, each edge is where two faces meet, but each vertex is where three edges meet.Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because in 2D, the expansion of a polygon includes the original area, the perimeter times r, and the number of vertices times (œÄ r¬≤)/4 (since each vertex contributes a quarter-circle). Similarly, in 3D, the expansion includes the original volume, the surface area times r, the total edge length times (œÄ r¬≤)/4 (since each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder), and the number of vertices times (4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8 (since each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere).Yes, that seems consistent. So, in 3D, each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder, and each vertex contributes an eighth-sphere.So, going back, my initial calculation was correct.Therefore, the total volume is 424 + (58/3)œÄ, which is equal to (1272 + 58œÄ)/3.So, m = 1272, n = 58, p = 3.Adding them together: 1272 + 58 + 3 = 1333.Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that 58 and 3 are relatively prime. 58 factors into 2 * 29, and 3 is prime, so yes, GCD(58, 3) = 1. So, they are relatively prime.Therefore, the final answer is 1333.But just to double-check, let me recount the steps:1. Original volume: 5*6*7 = 210.2. Surface area: 2*(5*6 + 5*7 + 6*7) = 2*(30 + 35 + 42) = 2*107 = 214.3. Total edge length: 4*(5 + 6 + 7) = 4*18 = 72.4. Number of vertices: 8.5. Using Steiner's formula:   Volume = V + S*r + L*(œÄ r¬≤)/4 + C*(4/3 œÄ r¬≥)/8   Plugging in:   Volume = 210 + 214*1 + 72*(œÄ*1¬≤)/4 + 8*(4/3 œÄ*1¬≥)/8   Simplify each term:   - 210   - 214   - 72*(œÄ)/4 = 18œÄ   - 8*(4/3 œÄ)/8 = (4/3 œÄ)   So, total:   210 + 214 = 424   18œÄ + (4/3)œÄ = (54/3 + 4/3)œÄ = (58/3)œÄ   So, total volume: 424 + (58/3)œÄ = (1272 + 58œÄ)/3   Therefore, m = 1272, n = 58, p = 3.   m + n + p = 1272 + 58 + 3 = 1333.Yes, that seems consistent.I think I'm confident with this answer.**Final Answer**boxed{1333}"},{"question":"Matias is a salesman in a bookstore.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used, but I also recall that sometimes inequalities like AM-GM can be helpful. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me write down what I need to minimize: ( x^3 y^2 z ). And the constraint is ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 9 ). Since all variables are positive, I can consider using the AM-GM inequality because it relates sums and products, which seems relevant here.The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, if I can express the given constraint in a form that allows me to apply AM-GM, that might help. But the constraint is a sum of reciprocals, and I need to relate it to the product ( x^3 y^2 z ). Maybe I need to manipulate the terms to make them compatible.Let me consider the reciprocals ( frac{1}{x}, frac{1}{y}, frac{1}{z} ). If I can express these in terms that match the exponents in ( x^3 y^2 z ), perhaps I can apply AM-GM effectively. The exponents in the product are 3, 2, and 1 for ( x, y, z ) respectively. That suggests that I might need to split the reciprocals into parts that correspond to these exponents.For example, I can think of splitting ( frac{1}{x} ) into three equal parts, ( frac{1}{y} ) into two equal parts, and ( frac{1}{z} ) as a single term. So, let me write:[frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x}][frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y}][frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{z}]Now, adding these up, I have:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}]So, that's a total of 7 terms. Now, I can apply the AM-GM inequality to these 7 terms:[frac{frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{4x} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}}{7} geq sqrt[7]{frac{1}{4x} cdot frac{1}{4x} cdot frac{1}{4x} cdot frac{1}{4x} cdot frac{1}{2y} cdot frac{1}{2y} cdot frac{1}{z}}]Simplifying the left side, since all the terms are equal, it's just:[frac{4 cdot frac{1}{4x} + 2 cdot frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}}{7} = frac{frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}}{7} = frac{9}{7}]So, the inequality becomes:[frac{9}{7} geq sqrt[7]{frac{1}{(4x)^4 cdot (2y)^2 cdot z}}]Let me compute the denominator inside the root:[(4x)^4 = 256x^4][(2y)^2 = 4y^2]So, the product is ( 256x^4 cdot 4y^2 cdot z = 1024x^4 y^2 z ).Therefore, the inequality is:[frac{9}{7} geq sqrt[7]{frac{1}{1024x^4 y^2 z}}]Raising both sides to the 7th power:[left( frac{9}{7} right)^7 geq frac{1}{1024x^4 y^2 z}]Taking reciprocals (and reversing the inequality):[frac{1024x^4 y^2 z}{1} geq left( frac{7}{9} right)^7]So,[x^4 y^2 z geq frac{7^7}{9^7 cdot 1024}]Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum of ( x^3 y^2 z ), not ( x^4 y^2 z ). Hmm, so I have an extra ( x ) in the exponent. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.Perhaps I should split the terms differently. Let me think again. The product I need is ( x^3 y^2 z ), so maybe I should split the reciprocals in a way that corresponds to the exponents 3, 2, 1.So, for ( x ), which has exponent 3, I can split ( frac{1}{x} ) into three equal parts: ( frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} ).For ( y ), which has exponent 2, I can split ( frac{1}{y} ) into two equal parts: ( frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y} ).And for ( z ), which has exponent 1, I can leave it as ( frac{1}{z} ).So, now, the total number of terms is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 terms. Let me write that:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}]Now, applying AM-GM to these 6 terms:[frac{frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}}{6} geq sqrt[6]{frac{1}{3x} cdot frac{1}{3x} cdot frac{1}{3x} cdot frac{1}{2y} cdot frac{1}{2y} cdot frac{1}{z}}]Simplifying the left side:[frac{3 cdot frac{1}{3x} + 2 cdot frac{1}{2y} + frac{1}{z}}{6} = frac{frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}}{6} = frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2}]So, the inequality becomes:[frac{3}{2} geq sqrt[6]{frac{1}{(3x)^3 cdot (2y)^2 cdot z}}]Calculating the denominator inside the root:[(3x)^3 = 27x^3][(2y)^2 = 4y^2]So, the product is ( 27x^3 cdot 4y^2 cdot z = 108x^3 y^2 z ).Thus, the inequality is:[frac{3}{2} geq sqrt[6]{frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}}]Raising both sides to the 6th power:[left( frac{3}{2} right)^6 geq frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}]Calculating ( left( frac{3}{2} right)^6 ):[left( frac{3}{2} right)^6 = frac{729}{64}]So,[frac{729}{64} geq frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}]Taking reciprocals (and reversing the inequality):[108x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729}]Therefore,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729 cdot 108}]Calculating the denominator:[729 times 108 = 729 times 100 + 729 times 8 = 72900 + 5832 = 78732]So,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{78732}]Simplifying the fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by 4:[frac{16}{19683}]Wait, 78732 divided by 4 is 19683, and 64 divided by 4 is 16. So,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{16}{19683}]But let me check if this is correct. Because when I applied AM-GM, I split the reciprocals into 6 terms, but the original constraint was 9, so maybe I need to adjust the weights differently.Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me recount. I split ( frac{1}{x} ) into 3 terms, ( frac{1}{y} ) into 2 terms, and ( frac{1}{z} ) into 1 term, totaling 6 terms. So, the AM-GM should be applied to 6 terms, which I did. But then, the left side was ( frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2} ), which seems correct.But let me verify the calculation of ( 729 times 108 ). 729 times 100 is 72900, and 729 times 8 is 5832, so total is 72900 + 5832 = 78732. Yes, that's correct. So, ( frac{64}{78732} = frac{16}{19683} ).But wait, 19683 is 9^7? No, 9^7 is 4782969, which is much larger. Wait, 9^6 is 531441, so 9^7 is indeed 4782969. So, 19683 is 9^5? Let me check: 9^1=9, 9^2=81, 9^3=729, 9^4=6561, 9^5=59049. Hmm, no, 19683 is actually 3^9, which is 19683. So, maybe I can leave it as is.But wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go back.When I split ( frac{1}{x} ) into three terms, each ( frac{1}{3x} ), and ( frac{1}{y} ) into two terms, each ( frac{1}{2y} ), and ( frac{1}{z} ) as one term, then the product inside the AM-GM is:[left( frac{1}{3x} right)^3 times left( frac{1}{2y} right)^2 times left( frac{1}{z} right)^1 = frac{1}{(3x)^3 (2y)^2 z} = frac{1}{27x^3 cdot 4y^2 cdot z} = frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}]So, the inequality is:[frac{3}{2} geq sqrt[6]{frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}}]Raising both sides to the 6th power:[left( frac{3}{2} right)^6 = frac{729}{64} geq frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}]So,[108x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729}]Therefore,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729 times 108}]Calculating ( 729 times 108 ):729 √ó 100 = 72900729 √ó 8 = 5832Total = 72900 + 5832 = 78732So,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{78732}]Simplify ( frac{64}{78732} ):Divide numerator and denominator by 4:64 √∑ 4 = 1678732 √∑ 4 = 19683So,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{16}{19683}]But wait, 16 and 19683 have no common factors, so that's the simplified form.But let me check if this is indeed the minimum. For equality in AM-GM, all the terms must be equal. So, in our case, the terms ( frac{1}{3x}, frac{1}{3x}, frac{1}{3x}, frac{1}{2y}, frac{1}{2y}, frac{1}{z} ) must all be equal.So,[frac{1}{3x} = frac{1}{2y} = frac{1}{z}]Let me denote this common value as ( k ). So,[frac{1}{3x} = k implies x = frac{1}{3k}][frac{1}{2y} = k implies y = frac{1}{2k}][frac{1}{z} = k implies z = frac{1}{k}]Now, substitute these into the original constraint:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 9]Substituting the expressions in terms of ( k ):[3k + 2k + k = 9][6k = 9][k = frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2}]So,[x = frac{1}{3k} = frac{1}{3 times frac{3}{2}} = frac{1}{frac{9}{2}} = frac{2}{9}][y = frac{1}{2k} = frac{1}{2 times frac{3}{2}} = frac{1}{3}][z = frac{1}{k} = frac{1}{frac{3}{2}} = frac{2}{3}]Now, let's compute ( x^3 y^2 z ):[x^3 = left( frac{2}{9} right)^3 = frac{8}{729}][y^2 = left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 = frac{1}{9}][z = frac{2}{3}]Multiplying them together:[x^3 y^2 z = frac{8}{729} times frac{1}{9} times frac{2}{3} = frac{8 times 1 times 2}{729 times 9 times 3} = frac{16}{19683}]So, indeed, the minimum value is ( frac{16}{19683} ).Wait a minute, but earlier when I tried splitting into 7 terms, I got a different result. Let me check that again.In the first approach, I split ( frac{1}{x} ) into four terms, ( frac{1}{y} ) into two terms, and ( frac{1}{z} ) as one term, totaling 7 terms. Then I applied AM-GM and ended up with ( x^4 y^2 z geq frac{7^7}{9^7 cdot 256} ), which simplified to ( frac{1}{46656} ). But that was for ( x^4 y^2 z ), not ( x^3 y^2 z ). So, perhaps that approach wasn't directly applicable.In the second approach, splitting into 6 terms, I got ( x^3 y^2 z geq frac{16}{19683} ), which seems more relevant. And when I checked the equality condition, it gave me consistent values for ( x, y, z ) that satisfy the original constraint, and the product ( x^3 y^2 z ) indeed equals ( frac{16}{19683} ).Therefore, I think the correct minimum value is ( frac{16}{19683} ).But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make arithmetic errors.Starting from the AM-GM step:[frac{3}{2} geq sqrt[6]{frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}}]Raising both sides to the 6th power:[left( frac{3}{2} right)^6 = frac{729}{64} geq frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}]So,[108x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729}]Thus,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{729 times 108}]Calculating ( 729 times 108 ):729 √ó 100 = 72900729 √ó 8 = 5832Total = 72900 + 5832 = 78732So,[x^3 y^2 z geq frac{64}{78732} = frac{16}{19683}]Yes, that's correct.But wait, 19683 is 9^5? Let me check:9^1 = 99^2 = 819^3 = 7299^4 = 65619^5 = 59049No, 19683 is actually 3^9, which is 19683. So, it's correct.Therefore, the minimum value of ( x^3 y^2 z ) is ( frac{16}{19683} ).But wait, in the initial problem statement, the user provided a solution where they split into 7 terms and got ( frac{1}{46656} ). But that was for ( x^4 y^2 z ), not ( x^3 y^2 z ). So, perhaps that was a different approach, but in my approach, splitting into 6 terms gives the correct result for ( x^3 y^2 z ).Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to confirm.Let me set up the Lagrangian:[mathcal{L}(x, y, z, lambda) = x^3 y^2 z - lambda left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} - 9 right)]Taking partial derivatives:[frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = 3x^2 y^2 z + lambda frac{1}{x^2} = 0][frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = 2x^3 y z + lambda frac{1}{y^2} = 0][frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial z} = x^3 y^2 + lambda frac{1}{z^2} = 0][frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = - left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} - 9 right) = 0]From the first equation:[3x^2 y^2 z = -lambda frac{1}{x^2} implies lambda = -3x^4 y^2 z]From the second equation:[2x^3 y z = -lambda frac{1}{y^2} implies lambda = -2x^3 y^3 z]From the third equation:[x^3 y^2 = -lambda frac{1}{z^2} implies lambda = -x^3 y^2 z^2]So, setting the expressions for ( lambda ) equal:From first and second:[-3x^4 y^2 z = -2x^3 y^3 z implies 3x^4 y^2 z = 2x^3 y^3 z]Divide both sides by ( x^3 y^2 z ) (since ( x, y, z ) are positive, we can divide):[3x = 2y implies y = frac{3}{2}x]From first and third:[-3x^4 y^2 z = -x^3 y^2 z^2 implies 3x^4 y^2 z = x^3 y^2 z^2]Divide both sides by ( x^3 y^2 z ):[3x = z]So, ( z = 3x ).Now, we have ( y = frac{3}{2}x ) and ( z = 3x ).Substitute these into the constraint:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 9][frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{frac{3}{2}x} + frac{1}{3x} = 9][frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{3x} + frac{1}{3x} = 9][frac{1}{x} + frac{3}{3x} = 9][frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x} = 9][frac{2}{x} = 9 implies x = frac{2}{9}]Then,[y = frac{3}{2}x = frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{9} = frac{1}{3}][z = 3x = 3 times frac{2}{9} = frac{2}{3}]So, the critical point is at ( x = frac{2}{9} ), ( y = frac{1}{3} ), ( z = frac{2}{3} ).Now, compute ( x^3 y^2 z ):[x^3 = left( frac{2}{9} right)^3 = frac{8}{729}][y^2 = left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 = frac{1}{9}][z = frac{2}{3}][x^3 y^2 z = frac{8}{729} times frac{1}{9} times frac{2}{3} = frac{16}{19683}]So, using Lagrange multipliers confirms that the minimum value is indeed ( frac{16}{19683} ).Wait, but earlier when I split into 7 terms, I got ( frac{1}{46656} ), which is much smaller. But that was for ( x^4 y^2 z ), not ( x^3 y^2 z ). So, that approach was incorrect because I was minimizing a different expression.Therefore, the correct minimum value is ( frac{16}{19683} ).But let me check if this is indeed the minimum. Is there a way to verify this? Maybe by testing another point.Suppose I choose ( x = frac{1}{6} ), ( y = frac{1}{3} ), ( z = frac{1}{2} ), as in the initial solution. Let's compute the constraint:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11]But the constraint is 9, so this point doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, it's not relevant.Alternatively, let's choose ( x = frac{2}{9} ), ( y = frac{1}{3} ), ( z = frac{2}{3} ), which we found earlier. The constraint is satisfied:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{9}{2} + 3 + frac{3}{2} = frac{9}{2} + frac{6}{2} + frac{3}{2} = frac{18}{2} = 9]Yes, it satisfies the constraint.Now, let's compute ( x^3 y^2 z ):[left( frac{2}{9} right)^3 times left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 times frac{2}{3} = frac{8}{729} times frac{1}{9} times frac{2}{3} = frac{16}{19683}]So, it's consistent.Therefore, I can confidently say that the minimum value of ( x^3 y^2 z ) is ( frac{16}{19683} ).But wait, let me check the initial approach again. The user's initial solution split into 7 terms and got ( frac{1}{46656} ). But that was for ( x^4 y^2 z ). So, perhaps they made a mistake in the number of terms or the exponents.In any case, my approach using AM-GM with 6 terms and Lagrange multipliers both lead to the same result, so I think that's correct.Therefore, the minimum value is ( frac{16}{19683} )."},{"question":"A certain class of students' heights are being surveyed (unit: centimeters).

Find the slope angle of the line.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: a line y = kx + 3 intersects a circle (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4, and the chord length cut by the line from the circle is 2‚àö3. I need to find the slope angle of the line. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the chord length in a circle can be related to the distance from the center of the circle to the line. The formula for the chord length is 2‚àö(r¬≤ - d¬≤), where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center to the line. So, if I can find the distance d, I can relate it to the given chord length and solve for k.Let me write down the given information:- The circle equation is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4. So, the center of the circle, C, is at (2, 3), and the radius r is ‚àö4 = 2.- The line is y = kx + 3. I need to find the slope k, and then determine the angle it makes with the x-axis.The chord length is given as 2‚àö3. Using the chord length formula, 2‚àö(r¬≤ - d¬≤) = 2‚àö3. Let me plug in the values:2‚àö(2¬≤ - d¬≤) = 2‚àö3Divide both sides by 2:‚àö(4 - d¬≤) = ‚àö3Square both sides:4 - d¬≤ = 3So, d¬≤ = 4 - 3 = 1Therefore, d = ‚àö1 = 1Okay, so the distance from the center of the circle to the line is 1. Now, I need to find the distance from the center (2, 3) to the line y = kx + 3.The formula for the distance from a point (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax‚ÇÄ + By‚ÇÄ + C| / ‚àö(A¬≤ + B¬≤). Let me rewrite the line equation in standard form:y = kx + 3 can be rewritten as kx - y + 3 = 0. So, A = k, B = -1, C = 3.Plugging into the distance formula:d = |k*2 + (-1)*3 + 3| / ‚àö(k¬≤ + (-1)¬≤) = |2k - 3 + 3| / ‚àö(k¬≤ + 1) = |2k| / ‚àö(k¬≤ + 1)We found earlier that d = 1, so:|2k| / ‚àö(k¬≤ + 1) = 1Let me solve this equation for k. Since the absolute value is involved, I can square both sides to eliminate it:(2k)¬≤ / (k¬≤ + 1) = 1¬≤4k¬≤ / (k¬≤ + 1) = 1Multiply both sides by (k¬≤ + 1):4k¬≤ = k¬≤ + 1Subtract k¬≤ from both sides:3k¬≤ = 1Divide both sides by 3:k¬≤ = 1/3Take square roots:k = ¬±‚àö(1/3) = ¬±(‚àö3)/3So, the slope k is either ‚àö3/3 or -‚àö3/3.Now, I need to find the slope angle. The slope angle Œ∏ is the angle that the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis, measured counterclockwise. The tangent of this angle is equal to the slope k.So, tanŒ∏ = k = ¬±‚àö3/3I know that tan(œÄ/6) = ‚àö3/3 and tan(5œÄ/6) = -‚àö3/3 because tan is positive in the first and third quadrants, but since we're dealing with angles between 0 and œÄ for the slope, the angles would be œÄ/6 and 5œÄ/6.Wait, let me verify that. If tanŒ∏ = ‚àö3/3, then Œ∏ is œÄ/6. If tanŒ∏ = -‚àö3/3, then Œ∏ is 5œÄ/6 because in the second quadrant, the tangent is negative, and the reference angle is œÄ/6.Yes, that makes sense. So, the slope angles are œÄ/6 and 5œÄ/6.Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:1. Found the center and radius of the circle.2. Used the chord length formula to find the distance from the center to the line.3. Applied the distance formula from point to line to set up an equation.4. Solved for k, found two possible slopes.5. Calculated the corresponding angles using arctangent.Everything seems to check out. I think I've got the right answers.**Final Answer**The slope angle of the line is boxed{dfrac{pi}{6}} or boxed{dfrac{5pi}{6}}."},{"question":"At Eastern High School, the 150 students who participate in the Math Club meet weekly to discuss mathematics and enjoy snacks.

How many full recipes should Lucy and Charles prepare?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many full recipes Lucy and Charles should prepare for the Math Club event. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, there are 150 students in the Math Club, and each student eats an average of three cookies. So, normally, without any scheduling conflicts, the total number of cookies needed would be 150 students multiplied by 3 cookies each. That would be 150 √ó 3 = 450 cookies.But wait, there's a scheduling conflict with a school play, and only 60% of the students are expected to attend. So, I need to adjust the number of students attending. To find 60% of 150 students, I can calculate 150 √ó 0.60. Let me do that: 150 √ó 0.60 = 90 students.Now, with 90 students attending, and each still eating three cookies, the total number of cookies needed is 90 √ó 3. Let me compute that: 90 √ó 3 = 270 cookies.Next, I need to determine how many full recipes Lucy and Charles need to prepare. Each recipe makes a batch of 20 cookies. So, I'll divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe: 270 √∑ 20. Let me calculate that: 270 √∑ 20 = 13.5.Hmm, they can't make half a recipe, so they'll need to round up to the next whole number. That means they need to prepare 14 full recipes to have enough cookies for everyone.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 150 students, 60% attendance is indeed 90 students. Each student eats three cookies, so 90 √ó 3 = 270 cookies. Each recipe makes 20 cookies, so 270 √∑ 20 = 13.5. Since they can't make half a recipe, rounding up to 14 makes sense.I think that's all the steps. They need to prepare 14 full recipes."},{"question":"Compute the sum of the number 16 - sqrt{2023} and its radical conjugate.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the sum of the number 16 minus the square root of 2023 and its radical conjugate. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I remember that a radical conjugate is when you change the sign of the radical part in a binomial expression. So, if I have a number like a minus b, its radical conjugate would be a plus b. In this case, the number is 16 minus the square root of 2023. So, its radical conjugate should be 16 plus the square root of 2023, right?Let me write that down to make it clearer. The original number is 16 - ‚àö2023, and its radical conjugate is 16 + ‚àö2023. Now, I need to add these two numbers together. So, the sum would be (16 - ‚àö2023) + (16 + ‚àö2023). When I add these two expressions, I can combine like terms. The constants are 16 and 16, and the radical terms are -‚àö2023 and +‚àö2023. Let me add the constants first: 16 + 16 equals 32. Now, for the radical terms: -‚àö2023 + ‚àö2023. Wait a second, if I have a negative square root and a positive square root of the same number, they should cancel each other out, right? So, -‚àö2023 plus ‚àö2023 is zero. That means the radical parts disappear from the sum. So, putting it all together, the sum is 32 + 0, which is just 32. That seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started with the number 16 - ‚àö2023 and its conjugate 16 + ‚àö2023. Adding them together, the constants add up to 32, and the radicals cancel each other. Yep, that seems correct. I guess another way to think about it is that when you have a binomial with a radical and its conjugate, their sum is always twice the non-radical part. So, in this case, twice 16 is 32. That makes sense too. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The process seems pretty simple, just adding the two numbers and seeing that the radicals cancel out. So, I feel confident that the sum is indeed 32.**Final Answer**The sum of the number and its radical conjugate is boxed{32}."},{"question":"If the function f(x)= dfrac {4x}{x^{2}+1} is monotonically increasing in the interval (m,2m+1), then the range of the real number m is (quad)  A: (-1,0]  B: (-1,0)  C: [0,1]  D: (0,1]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = 4x/(x¬≤ + 1) is monotonically increasing in the interval (m, 2m + 1).

Applying that here:g(x) = 4x, so g'(x) = 4s(x) = x¬≤ + 1, so s'(x) = 2xPutting that into the quotient rule:f'(x) = [4*(x¬≤ + 1) - 4x*(2x)] / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤Let me compute the numerator:4*(x¬≤ + 1) = 4x¬≤ + 44x*(2x) = 8x¬≤So, numerator = 4x¬≤ + 4 - 8x¬≤ = -4x¬≤ + 4So, f'(x) = (-4x¬≤ + 4) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤I can factor out a -4 from the numerator:f'(x) = -4(x¬≤ - 1) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤Wait, actually, that's not quite right. Let me check:Wait, numerator is -4x¬≤ + 4, which is equal to -4(x¬≤ - 1). Hmm, but x¬≤ - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x + 1). So, f'(x) = -4(x - 1)(x + 1) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤.But actually, let me write that correctly. The numerator is -4x¬≤ + 4, which is 4(1 - x¬≤). So, f'(x) = 4(1 - x¬≤) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤.Yes, that's better. So, f'(x) = 4(1 - x¬≤) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤.Now, to find where f(x) is increasing, we need f'(x) ‚â• 0. So, let's set 4(1 - x¬≤) / (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤ ‚â• 0.Since the denominator (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤ is always positive for all real x, the sign of f'(x) depends on the numerator, which is 4(1 - x¬≤). Since 4 is positive, the sign is determined by (1 - x¬≤).So, 1 - x¬≤ ‚â• 0 implies that x¬≤ ‚â§ 1, which means |x| ‚â§ 1. So, x is in [-1, 1]. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on the interval [-1, 1].Okay, so f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-1, 1]. Now, the problem says that f(x) is increasing on the interval (m, 2m + 1). So, this interval (m, 2m + 1) must be a subset of [-1, 1]. That is, (m, 2m + 1) must lie entirely within [-1, 1].So, to ensure that, we need two conditions:1. The left endpoint m must be greater than or equal to -1.2. The right endpoint 2m + 1 must be less than or equal to 1.Additionally, since it's an open interval (m, 2m + 1), we need to make sure that m < 2m + 1, which simplifies to m > -1. Wait, that's already covered by the first condition, but let me check.Wait, m < 2m + 1 implies that m - 2m < 1, so -m < 1, which implies m > -1. So, that's another condition, but it's the same as m > -1.So, putting it all together, we have:1. m > -12. 2m + 1 ‚â§ 13. m < 2m + 1 (which is redundant as it's equivalent to m > -1)So, let's solve the second inequality: 2m + 1 ‚â§ 1.Subtract 1 from both sides: 2m ‚â§ 0Divide by 2: m ‚â§ 0So, combining with the first condition, m > -1 and m ‚â§ 0.Therefore, m must be in (-1, 0].But wait, let me double-check. The interval (m, 2m + 1) must be entirely within [-1, 1]. So, m must be greater than -1, and 2m + 1 must be less than or equal to 1.So, m > -1 and m ‚â§ 0.But also, since it's an open interval, we have to make sure that m is strictly greater than -1, because if m were equal to -1, the interval would be (-1, 2*(-1) + 1) = (-1, -1), which is not an interval. So, m must be greater than -1.Similarly, if m = 0, then the interval is (0, 1), which is within [-1, 1], so that's acceptable.Wait, but if m = 0, 2m + 1 = 1, so the interval is (0, 1), which is fine because the function is increasing up to 1, but not including 1. So, that's okay.But if m were greater than 0, say m = 0.5, then 2m + 1 = 2, so the interval would be (0.5, 2). But 2 is outside of the increasing interval [-1, 1], so that's not acceptable. So, m cannot be greater than 0.Similarly, if m is less than or equal to -1, then the interval would start before -1, which is outside the increasing interval. So, m must be greater than -1.Therefore, the range of m is (-1, 0].Looking at the options, that's option A: (-1, 0].Wait, but let me check if m can be 0. If m = 0, then the interval is (0, 1), which is entirely within [-1, 1], and the function is increasing there. So, m = 0 is acceptable.If m approaches -1 from the right, say m = -0.999, then 2m + 1 = 2*(-0.999) + 1 = -1.998 + 1 = -0.998, so the interval is (-0.999, -0.998), which is within [-1, 1], and the function is increasing there.But if m = -1, then the interval would be (-1, -1), which is not an interval, so m cannot be -1.Similarly, if m = 0, the interval is (0, 1), which is fine.So, yes, m must be greater than -1 and less than or equal to 0.Therefore, the correct answer is A: (-1, 0]."},{"question":"The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n. Given that a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} - a = 0 and S_{2m-1} = 38, then m = _______","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, the problem says that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n. Okay, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a common difference, right? So, if the first term is a_1 and the common difference is d, then the nth term a_n is a_1 + (n-1)d. Got that.Now, the problem gives me two specific pieces of information:1. a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} - a = 02. S_{2m-1} = 38And I need to find the value of m.Let me tackle the first equation: a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} - a = 0. Hmm, okay. So, I need to express a_{m-1} and a_{m+1} in terms of the arithmetic sequence.Since it's an arithmetic sequence, I know that a_{m-1} = a_1 + (m-2)d and a_{m+1} = a_1 + m*d. So, if I add those two together:a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} = [a_1 + (m-2)d] + [a_1 + m*d] = 2a_1 + (2m - 2)d.So, the equation becomes:2a_1 + (2m - 2)d - a = 0.Wait, but I'm not sure what 'a' is here. Is it a term in the sequence? Or is it a constant? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to figure that out.Looking back at the problem statement, it just says \\"a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} - a = 0\\". Hmm. Maybe 'a' is a typo or maybe it's supposed to be a specific term. Wait, if I think about the properties of arithmetic sequences, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, the terms equidistant from a central term are symmetric around it. So, a_{m-1} and a_{m+1} are equidistant from a_m. Therefore, their average should be equal to a_m.So, (a_{m-1} + a_{m+1}) / 2 = a_m.Which means a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} = 2a_m.So, substituting that into the given equation:2a_m - a = 0 => 2a_m = a => a_m = a/2.Okay, so that tells me that the m-th term is half of 'a'. But I still don't know what 'a' is. Maybe 'a' is a specific term? Or perhaps it's a constant term in the sequence. Wait, maybe 'a' is the first term a_1? Let me check.If 'a' is a_1, then a_m = a_1 / 2. But in an arithmetic sequence, a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d. So, setting that equal to a_1 / 2:a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2Subtracting a_1 / 2 from both sides:a_1 / 2 + (m - 1)d = 0Hmm, that gives a relationship between a_1 and d, but I don't know if that's helpful yet. Maybe I need to look at the second equation given: S_{2m - 1} = 38.The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]. So, for S_{2m - 1}, that would be:S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)d] = 38.Let me write that out:(2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + 2(m - 1)d] = 38.Simplify inside the brackets:2a_1 + 2(m - 1)d = 2[a_1 + (m - 1)d] = 2a_m.So, substituting back in:(2m - 1)/2 * 2a_m = 38.The 2s cancel out:(2m - 1) * a_m = 38.But earlier, from the first equation, we found that a_m = a / 2. So, substituting that in:(2m - 1) * (a / 2) = 38.So, (2m - 1) * a = 76.Hmm, but I still don't know what 'a' is. Wait, if 'a' is a term in the sequence, maybe it's a specific term like a_1 or a_m. Earlier, I thought 'a' might be a_1, but let's see.If 'a' is a_1, then:(2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.But from earlier, we have a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.Which simplifies to:(m - 1)d = -a_1 / 2.So, d = (-a_1) / [2(m - 1)].Now, let's plug this back into the sum equation.Wait, maybe there's a better way. Since we have S_{2m - 1} = 38 and we expressed it in terms of a_m, and a_m = a / 2, maybe we can express everything in terms of a_m.Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.Since the sum S_{2m - 1} = 38, and we know that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of an odd number of terms is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the middle term. So, S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1) * a_m.So, (2m - 1) * a_m = 38.But from the first equation, we have a_{m - 1} + a_{m + 1} = 2a_m = a.So, 2a_m = a => a_m = a / 2.Therefore, substituting back into the sum equation:(2m - 1) * (a / 2) = 38.So, (2m - 1) * a = 76.But I still don't know what 'a' is. Maybe 'a' is a specific term? Or perhaps it's a constant. Wait, maybe 'a' is the first term a_1.If 'a' is a_1, then:(2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.But from earlier, we have a_m = a_1 / 2.And a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.So, a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.Subtracting a_1 / 2 from both sides:a_1 / 2 + (m - 1)d = 0.So, (m - 1)d = -a_1 / 2.Therefore, d = (-a_1) / [2(m - 1)].Now, let's plug this back into the sum equation.Wait, but I already used that to get to (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.So, (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.But I also have d expressed in terms of a_1 and m.Is there another equation I can use? Maybe I need to express S_{2m - 1} in terms of a_1 and d.Wait, S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)d].We already did that and found it equals 38.But we also have that (2m - 1) * a_m = 38.And a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.So, substituting a_m = a_1 / 2 into (2m - 1) * a_m = 38:(2m - 1) * (a_1 / 2) = 38.Which simplifies to:(2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.But from earlier, we have (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.So, that's consistent.But I still need another equation to solve for m.Wait, maybe I can express d in terms of a_1 and m, and then substitute back into the sum equation.From earlier, d = (-a_1) / [2(m - 1)].So, let's plug this into the sum equation:S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)d] = 38.Substituting d:= (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)*(-a_1)/(2(m - 1))].Simplify the term inside the brackets:First, (2m - 2) = 2(m - 1), so:= (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2(m - 1))*(-a_1)/(2(m - 1))].The 2(m - 1) cancels out:= (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 - a_1].Simplify inside the brackets:2a_1 - a_1 = a_1.So, now we have:(2m - 1)/2 * a_1 = 38.But from earlier, we have (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.So, (2m - 1)/2 * a_1 = 38 is the same as (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76.Which is consistent.So, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to find another relationship.Wait, perhaps I can express a_1 in terms of m.From (2m - 1) * a_1 = 76, we have:a_1 = 76 / (2m - 1).And from earlier, d = (-a_1) / [2(m - 1)].So, d = (-76 / (2m - 1)) / [2(m - 1)] = (-76) / [2(m - 1)(2m - 1)].Simplify:d = (-38) / [(m - 1)(2m - 1)].Now, let's see if we can find another equation involving a_1 and d.Wait, we have a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.So, substituting a_1 = 76 / (2m - 1) and d = (-38) / [(m - 1)(2m - 1)]:76 / (2m - 1) + (m - 1)*(-38) / [(m - 1)(2m - 1)] = 76 / (2m - 1) / 2.Simplify:76 / (2m - 1) - 38 / (2m - 1) = 38 / (2m - 1).Which is:(76 - 38) / (2m - 1) = 38 / (2m - 1).So, 38 / (2m - 1) = 38 / (2m - 1).Which is an identity, meaning it's true for any m, but we need to find a specific m that satisfies the original conditions.Hmm, so this approach isn't giving me a specific value for m. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, let's go back to the sum equation:S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1) * a_m = 38.And from the first equation, we have a_m = a / 2.So, (2m - 1) * (a / 2) = 38 => (2m - 1) * a = 76.But I still don't know what 'a' is. Maybe 'a' is a specific term, like a_1 or a_m. Wait, if 'a' is a_m, then:(2m - 1) * a_m = 38.But from the first equation, a_{m-1} + a_{m+1} = 2a_m = a.So, if 'a' is 2a_m, then:(2m - 1) * (2a_m) = 76.But we also have (2m - 1) * a_m = 38.So, substituting:(2m - 1) * (2a_m) = 76 => 2*(2m - 1)*a_m = 76.But (2m - 1)*a_m = 38, so 2*38 = 76, which is true.So, this doesn't help me find m.Wait, maybe I need to consider that 'a' is a specific term, like a_1.If 'a' is a_1, then:From the first equation, 2a_m = a_1.And from the sum equation, (2m - 1)*a_m = 38.So, substituting a_m = a_1 / 2:(2m - 1)*(a_1 / 2) = 38 => (2m - 1)*a_1 = 76.But we also have a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.So, a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2 => (m - 1)d = -a_1 / 2 => d = (-a_1) / [2(m - 1)].Now, let's express the sum S_{2m - 1} in terms of a_1 and d.S_{2m - 1} = (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)d].Substituting d:= (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 + (2m - 2)*(-a_1)/(2(m - 1))].Simplify:= (2m - 1)/2 * [2a_1 - (2m - 2)a_1/(2(m - 1))].Factor out a_1:= (2m - 1)/2 * a_1 * [2 - (2m - 2)/(2(m - 1))].Simplify the term inside the brackets:2 - (2m - 2)/(2(m - 1)) = 2 - [2(m - 1)]/[2(m - 1)] = 2 - 1 = 1.So, the sum becomes:(2m - 1)/2 * a_1 * 1 = (2m - 1)a_1 / 2 = 38.But from earlier, (2m - 1)a_1 = 76, so:76 / 2 = 38, which is consistent.Again, I'm not getting a specific value for m. Maybe I need to assign a value to m and see if it works.Wait, let's try m = 10.Then, 2m - 1 = 19.So, S_{19} = 19 * a_{10} = 38 => a_{10} = 2.From the first equation, a_{9} + a_{11} = 2a_{10} = 4.So, a_{9} + a_{11} = 4.But a_{10} = 2, so a_{9} = 2 - d and a_{11} = 2 + d.So, (2 - d) + (2 + d) = 4, which is true.So, m = 10 works.Wait, but how did I know to try m = 10? Maybe I can solve for m.From (2m - 1)*a_m = 38 and a_m = a / 2, and assuming 'a' is a_1, then:(2m - 1)*a_1 = 76.But a_m = a_1 / 2, so a_1 = 2a_m.Substituting back:(2m - 1)*2a_m = 76 => (2m - 1)*a_m = 38.Which is the same as the sum equation.So, I'm still stuck.Wait, maybe I can express a_m in terms of m.From a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2.So, a_1 + (m - 1)d = a_1 / 2 => (m - 1)d = -a_1 / 2.From the sum equation, (2m - 1)*a_m = 38.But a_m = a_1 / 2, so:(2m - 1)*(a_1 / 2) = 38 => (2m - 1)*a_1 = 76.So, a_1 = 76 / (2m - 1).Substituting back into (m - 1)d = -a_1 / 2:(m - 1)d = - (76 / (2m - 1)) / 2 = -38 / (2m - 1).So, d = (-38) / [(m - 1)(2m - 1)].Now, let's see if we can find another relationship.Wait, maybe we can express a_1 in terms of d.From a_1 = 76 / (2m - 1).And from a_m = a_1 / 2 = 76 / [2(2m - 1)].But a_m is also equal to a_1 + (m - 1)d.So:76 / [2(2m - 1)] = 76 / (2m - 1) + (m - 1)*(-38) / [(m - 1)(2m - 1)].Simplify:76 / [2(2m - 1)] = 76 / (2m - 1) - 38 / (2m - 1).Combine the terms on the right:76 / (2m - 1) - 38 / (2m - 1) = (76 - 38) / (2m - 1) = 38 / (2m - 1).So, left side is 76 / [2(2m - 1)] = 38 / (2m - 1).Which is equal to the right side.So, again, it's consistent but doesn't help me find m.Wait, maybe I need to consider that m must be an integer, and 2m - 1 must divide 76.So, 2m - 1 is a divisor of 76.The divisors of 76 are 1, 2, 4, 19, 38, 76.But 2m - 1 must be odd, so the possible values are 1, 19, 38, 76. Wait, no, 38 and 76 are even, so only 1 and 19.So, 2m - 1 = 1 => m = 1.Or 2m - 1 = 19 => m = 10.Now, let's test m = 1.If m = 1, then 2m - 1 = 1.So, S_1 = a_1 = 38.From the first equation, a_{0} + a_{2} - a = 0.But a_0 is not defined in the sequence, so m = 1 is invalid.Therefore, m = 10.Yes, that makes sense. So, m = 10."},{"question":"A bicycle travels b/2 feet in t seconds.

Hmm, that looks like an ellipse equation. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that both terms under the square roots are quadratic in (x) and (y). Maybe I can complete the square for each to simplify them. Let's start with the first term:[sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 4}]Looking at the (x) terms: (x^2 - 4x). To complete the square, I take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4. So,[x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2]So the first term becomes:[sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + y^2}]That's the distance from the point ((x, y)) to the point ((2, 0)). Interesting.Now, the second term:[sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 4y + 5}]Again, let's complete the square for both (x) and (y). For (x): (x^2 - 2x). Half of -2 is -1, squared is 1. For (y): (y^2 + 4y). Half of 4 is 2, squared is 4. So,[x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + 4y + 4 = (x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2]But wait, the original expression is (x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 4y + 5). So, let's see:[x^2 - 2x + y^2 + 4y + 5 = (x - 1)^2 - 1 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 + 5]Simplify the constants:[-1 - 4 + 5 = 0]So, the second term becomes:[sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2}]That's the distance from the point ((x, y)) to the point ((1, -2)).So, putting it all together, the expression we're trying to maximize is the sum of distances from a point ((x, y)) on the ellipse (3x^2 + 4y^2 = 48) to the points ((2, 0)) and ((1, -2)).Hmm, okay. So, we have an ellipse and two fixed points. We need to find the maximum of the sum of distances from a point on the ellipse to these two points.First, let me write the ellipse equation in standard form. The given equation is:[3x^2 + 4y^2 = 48]Divide both sides by 48:[frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{12} = 1]So, the semi-major axis (a) is (sqrt{16} = 4) along the x-axis, and the semi-minor axis (b) is (sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}) along the y-axis.Now, the foci of the ellipse are located at a distance (c) from the center, where (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}).Calculating (c):[c = sqrt{16 - 12} = sqrt{4} = 2]So, the foci are at ((pm 2, 0)). That means one focus is at ((2, 0)), which is exactly one of the points we're considering! Interesting.So, the point ((2, 0)) is a focus of the ellipse. The other point is ((1, -2)). I wonder where that is relative to the ellipse.Let me check if ((1, -2)) is inside or outside the ellipse. Plugging into the ellipse equation:[frac{1^2}{16} + frac{(-2)^2}{12} = frac{1}{16} + frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{16} + frac{1}{3} approx 0.0625 + 0.3333 = 0.3958]Since this is less than 1, the point ((1, -2)) is inside the ellipse.So, we have one focus at ((2, 0)) and another point inside the ellipse at ((1, -2)). We need to find the maximum of the sum of distances from a point on the ellipse to these two points.I remember that for an ellipse, the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to (2a), which is 8 in this case. But here, one of the points is a focus, and the other is an arbitrary point inside the ellipse. So, the sum isn't necessarily constant.Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.Let me think about the problem geometrically. We have a point (P(x, y)) on the ellipse, and we need to maximize ( |PA| + |PB| ), where (A(2, 0)) and (B(1, -2)).Since (A) is a focus, and (B) is inside the ellipse, perhaps I can use some properties of ellipses or reflection properties.Wait, the reflection property of ellipses states that the angle between the tangent at any point and the line from that point to one focus is equal to the angle between the tangent and the line to the other focus. But I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the ellipse and express the sum in terms of a parameter, then find its maximum.Let me try that.Parametrizing the ellipse:Since the standard form is (frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{12} = 1), we can write:[x = 4 cos theta][y = 2sqrt{3} sin theta]Where (theta) is the parameter varying from 0 to (2pi).So, substituting into the expression:First, compute ( |PA| ):[sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + y^2} = sqrt{(4 cos theta - 2)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta)^2}]Similarly, compute ( |PB| ):[sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2} = sqrt{(4 cos theta - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2}]So, the expression to maximize is:[sqrt{(4 cos theta - 2)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta)^2} + sqrt{(4 cos theta - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2}]This seems complicated, but maybe we can simplify each square root.Let me compute each term separately.First, ( |PA| ):[sqrt{(4 cos theta - 2)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta)^2}]Expand the squares:[(4 cos theta - 2)^2 = 16 cos^2 theta - 16 cos theta + 4][(2sqrt{3} sin theta)^2 = 12 sin^2 theta]So, summing them:[16 cos^2 theta - 16 cos theta + 4 + 12 sin^2 theta]Combine like terms:[(16 cos^2 theta + 12 sin^2 theta) - 16 cos theta + 4]We can write (16 cos^2 theta + 12 sin^2 theta) as:[12 (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) + 4 cos^2 theta = 12 + 4 cos^2 theta]So, substituting back:[12 + 4 cos^2 theta - 16 cos theta + 4 = 16 + 4 cos^2 theta - 16 cos theta]Factor out 4:[4 (4 + cos^2 theta - 4 cos theta)]Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I can write it as:[4 cos^2 theta - 16 cos theta + 16 = 4 (cos^2 theta - 4 cos theta + 4)]Which is:[4 (cos theta - 2)^2]But (cos theta) ranges between -1 and 1, so (cos theta - 2) ranges between -3 and -1. So, the square is positive, and the square root is:[sqrt{4 (cos theta - 2)^2} = 2 | cos theta - 2 |]Since (cos theta - 2) is always negative, this simplifies to:[2 (2 - cos theta) = 4 - 2 cos theta]Wow, that's a nice simplification! So, ( |PA| = 4 - 2 cos theta ).Now, let's compute ( |PB| ):[sqrt{(4 cos theta - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2}]Again, expand the squares:[(4 cos theta - 1)^2 = 16 cos^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 1][(2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2 = 12 sin^2 theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta + 4]Summing them:[16 cos^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 1 + 12 sin^2 theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta + 4]Combine like terms:[(16 cos^2 theta + 12 sin^2 theta) - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta + 5]Again, (16 cos^2 theta + 12 sin^2 theta = 12 + 4 cos^2 theta), so substituting:[12 + 4 cos^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta + 5 = 17 + 4 cos^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta]Hmm, this doesn't seem to simplify as nicely as the first term. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, perhaps I can write this expression in terms of a single trigonometric function. Let me see.Let me denote (4 cos^2 theta) as (4 (1 - sin^2 theta)), so:[17 + 4 (1 - sin^2 theta) - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta = 17 + 4 - 4 sin^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta][= 21 - 4 sin^2 theta - 8 cos theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta]This still looks complicated. Maybe I can consider this as a quadratic in (sin theta):[-4 sin^2 theta + 8 sqrt{3} sin theta + (21 - 8 cos theta)]But this seems messy. Maybe another way.Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize using coordinates or use calculus to maximize the expression.Wait, let's recall that ( |PA| = 4 - 2 cos theta ). So, the total expression is:[4 - 2 cos theta + sqrt{(4 cos theta - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2}]Let me denote ( |PB| = sqrt{(4 cos theta - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{3} sin theta + 2)^2} ). So, the expression is (4 - 2 cos theta + |PB|).Hmm, maybe I can write ( |PB| ) in terms of (theta) and then take the derivative with respect to (theta) to find the maximum.But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can interpret ( |PB| ) geometrically.Wait, point (B) is at ((1, -2)). Maybe I can find the reflection of (B) across the center of the ellipse or something like that.Wait, the ellipse is centered at the origin, right? Because the standard form is (frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{12} = 1), so center is at ((0, 0)).So, reflecting (B(1, -2)) across the center would give ((-1, 2)). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can use the triangle inequality. Since we're dealing with sums of distances, perhaps the maximum occurs when the points are colinear in some way.Wait, another thought: since (A) is a focus, and the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant, which is (2a = 8). So, ( |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 8 ), where (F_1) and (F_2) are the foci.But in our case, one of the points is a focus, (A(2, 0)), and the other is (B(1, -2)). So, perhaps we can express ( |PA| + |PB| ) as ( |PF_2| + |PB| + |PF_1| - |PF_1| ), but not sure.Wait, let me think differently. Since ( |PA| + |PB| = |PF_2| + |PB| ), because (A) is (F_2). So, maybe we can write:[|PF_2| + |PB| = (|PF_2| + |PF_1|) + |PB| - |PF_1| = 8 + |PB| - |PF_1|]So, ( |PA| + |PB| = 8 + |PB| - |PF_1| ). Hmm, interesting.So, to maximize ( |PA| + |PB| ), we need to maximize ( |PB| - |PF_1| ). Because 8 is a constant.So, the problem reduces to maximizing ( |PB| - |PF_1| ).Hmm, but how?Wait, maybe we can interpret this as maximizing ( |PB| - |PF_1| ). That is, we need to find the maximum of ( |PB| - |PF_1| ) over all points (P) on the ellipse.Alternatively, since ( |PB| - |PF_1| ) can be rewritten as ( |PB| + |F_1P| ), but with a negative sign. Wait, no, it's ( |PB| - |PF_1| ).Wait, perhaps we can consider the difference of distances. I remember that the set of points where the difference of distances to two fixed points is constant is a hyperbola. But here, we are dealing with an ellipse, so maybe the maximum occurs at a specific point.Alternatively, maybe we can use the triangle inequality. Let's consider points (P), (B), and (F_1). The triangle inequality tells us that:[|PB| leq |PF_1| + |F_1B|]Which implies:[|PB| - |PF_1| leq |F_1B|]So, the maximum value of ( |PB| - |PF_1| ) is ( |F_1B| ), achieved when (P) lies on the line segment extending from (F_1) through (B) beyond (B). But since (P) is constrained to the ellipse, we need to check if such a point exists on the ellipse.Wait, (F_1) is at ((-2, 0)), and (B) is at ((1, -2)). So, the line connecting (F_1) and (B) can be parametrized as:[x = -2 + t(1 - (-2)) = -2 + 3t][y = 0 + t(-2 - 0) = -2t]Where (t) ranges from 0 to 1 to go from (F_1) to (B). But we need to go beyond (B) to see if the ellipse intersects this line beyond (B).So, let's substitute (x = -2 + 3t) and (y = -2t) into the ellipse equation:[frac{(-2 + 3t)^2}{16} + frac{(-2t)^2}{12} = 1]Compute each term:First term:[frac{( -2 + 3t )^2}{16} = frac{4 - 12t + 9t^2}{16}]Second term:[frac{( -2t )^2}{12} = frac{4t^2}{12} = frac{t^2}{3}]So, sum:[frac{4 - 12t + 9t^2}{16} + frac{t^2}{3} = 1]Multiply both sides by 48 to eliminate denominators:[3(4 - 12t + 9t^2) + 16t^2 = 48][12 - 36t + 27t^2 + 16t^2 = 48][12 - 36t + 43t^2 = 48][43t^2 - 36t + 12 - 48 = 0][43t^2 - 36t - 36 = 0]Now, solving this quadratic equation for (t):[t = frac{36 pm sqrt{(-36)^2 - 4 cdot 43 cdot (-36)}}{2 cdot 43}][t = frac{36 pm sqrt{1296 + 6264}}{86}][t = frac{36 pm sqrt{7560}}{86}][sqrt{7560} = sqrt{36 times 210} = 6 sqrt{210} approx 6 times 14.4914 approx 86.948]So,[t = frac{36 pm 86.948}{86}]Calculating both roots:First root:[t = frac{36 + 86.948}{86} approx frac{122.948}{86} approx 1.43]Second root:[t = frac{36 - 86.948}{86} approx frac{-50.948}{86} approx -0.592]So, the line intersects the ellipse at (t approx 1.43) and (t approx -0.592). So, beyond (B) (which is at (t = 1)), the ellipse intersects the line at (t approx 1.43). Therefore, the point (P) on the ellipse that lies on the extension of (F_1B) beyond (B) is at (t approx 1.43).Therefore, the maximum of ( |PB| - |PF_1| ) is ( |F_1B| ), which is achieved when (P) is at that intersection point.So, let's compute ( |F_1B| ):Points (F_1(-2, 0)) and (B(1, -2)):[|F_1B| = sqrt{(1 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 0)^2} = sqrt{(3)^2 + (-2)^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13}]Therefore, the maximum value of ( |PB| - |PF_1| ) is ( sqrt{13} ).Therefore, going back to our earlier expression:[|PA| + |PB| = 8 + |PB| - |PF_1| leq 8 + sqrt{13}]So, the maximum value of the expression is (8 + sqrt{13}).Wait, let me verify this conclusion. So, we have:[|PA| + |PB| = |PF_2| + |PB| = 8 + |PB| - |PF_1|]And we found that ( |PB| - |PF_1| leq |F_1B| = sqrt{13} ), so the maximum is (8 + sqrt{13}).Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the maximum value is (8 + sqrt{13}).**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{8 + sqrt{13}}."},{"question":"The re-evaluation of the Council of Wise Men occurs as follows: the king lines them up in a single file and places a hat of either white, blue, or red color on each of their heads. All wise men can see the colors of the hats of everyone in front of them, but they cannot see their own hat or the hats of those behind them. Once per minute, each wise man must shout out one of the three colors (each wise man shouts out a color only once).After this process is completed, the king will execute any wise man who shouts a color different from the color of his own hat.The night before the re-evaluation, all one hundred members of the Council of Wise Men agreed and came up with a strategy to minimize the number of those executed. How many of them are guaranteed to avoid execution?","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this puzzle about the Council of Wise Men and their hat colors. It sounds a bit like those logic puzzles where people have to guess their hat color based on what they see in front of them. Let me break it down step by step.First, there are 100 wise men lined up in a single file. Each has a hat that's either white, blue, or red. They can see the hats of everyone in front of them but not their own or those behind them. They have to shout out a color‚Äîwhite, blue, or red‚Äîonce per minute, and if they shout the wrong color, they get executed. The goal is to minimize the number of executions.Okay, so they need a strategy to maximize the number of correct guesses. Since they can see everyone in front of them, maybe they can use that information somehow. I remember hearing about similar puzzles where people use parity or some kind of counting system to communicate information about their own hat color.Let me think about how they could use the information they have. If they assign numbers to the colors‚Äîsay, white is 0, blue is 1, and red is 2‚Äîthey could use modular arithmetic to encode information. Maybe the first person in line (the one at the back) can shout out a color that encodes the sum of all the hats in front of him modulo 3. That way, the next person can use that information to figure out their own hat color.So, if the first person sees a certain arrangement of hats in front of him, he calculates the sum modulo 3 and shouts the corresponding color. This gives the next person a starting point. The second person can then see all the hats in front of him and knows the total sum modulo 3 from the first person's shout. By subtracting the sum of the hats he sees from the total sum, he can figure out his own hat color.This seems like it could work. Each subsequent person can use the information from the previous shouts and the hats they see in front of them to deduce their own hat color. The first person has a 1 in 3 chance of being correct, but everyone else can use the strategy to guarantee their own hat color.Wait, but the problem says they have to shout out a color once per minute, and each wise man shouts out a color only once. Does that mean they all shout at the same time, or one after the other? If they shout one after the other, the strategy I thought of makes sense because each person can hear the previous person's shout and use that information. But if they all shout at the same time, the strategy might not work because they can't hear each other's shouts in real-time.The problem says \\"once per minute, each wise man must shout out one of the three colors.\\" It doesn't specify the order, but I think it's safe to assume they shout one after the other, starting from the back. That way, each person can use the information from the previous shouts to figure out their own hat color.So, if they shout one after the other, starting from the back, the first person has a 1 in 3 chance of being correct, but everyone else can use the information from the previous shouts to guarantee their own hat color. That means 99 out of 100 wise men can be guaranteed to avoid execution.But wait, let me double-check. If the first person shouts a color that encodes the sum modulo 3, and the second person uses that information to figure out their own hat color, then the third person can do the same using the information from the first and second shouts, and so on. This seems to hold up.I think the key here is that they use the first person's shout as a starting point, and then each subsequent person uses the cumulative information from all previous shouts to deduce their own hat color. Since they're using modulo 3 arithmetic, and there are three possible colors, this should cover all possibilities.So, in conclusion, with this strategy, 99 wise men can be guaranteed to avoid execution, while the first person has a 1 in 3 chance of being executed. Therefore, the number of wise men guaranteed to avoid execution is 99."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=kx^{2}-ln x, if f(x) > 0 always holds within the domain of the function, then the range of k isA: left(frac{1}{e},eright)B: left(frac{1}{2e},frac{1}{e}right)C: (-infty,-frac{1}{2e})D: left(frac{1}{2e},+inftyright)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of k such that the function f(x) = kx¬≤ - ln x is always greater than 0 within its domain. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.First, I should recall the domain of the function. Since there's a natural logarithm term, ln x, the domain is x > 0 because ln x is only defined for positive x. So, I need to make sure that f(x) > 0 for all x > 0.The function is f(x) = kx¬≤ - ln x. I need to ensure that this expression is always positive. To do that, maybe I should analyze the behavior of the function. Perhaps finding its minimum value and ensuring that the minimum is still positive.To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and set it equal to zero. Let's compute the derivative:f'(x) = d/dx [kx¬≤ - ln x] = 2kx - (1/x).So, f'(x) = 2kx - 1/x. To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:2kx - 1/x = 0.Let me solve for x:2kx = 1/x  Multiply both sides by x: 2kx¬≤ = 1  So, x¬≤ = 1/(2k)  Therefore, x = sqrt(1/(2k)).Since x must be positive, we take the positive square root. So, the critical point is at x = sqrt(1/(2k)).Now, I need to check whether this critical point is a minimum or a maximum. I can do this by using the second derivative test or analyzing the sign changes of the first derivative.Let me compute the second derivative:f''(x) = d/dx [2kx - 1/x] = 2k + 1/x¬≤.Since k is a constant and x > 0, 2k + 1/x¬≤ is always positive as long as k is positive. If k is positive, then 2k is positive, and 1/x¬≤ is positive, so f''(x) > 0. Therefore, the critical point is a local minimum.So, the function f(x) has a minimum at x = sqrt(1/(2k)). To ensure that f(x) > 0 for all x > 0, this minimum value must be greater than 0.Let's compute f at x = sqrt(1/(2k)):f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = k*(sqrt(1/(2k)))¬≤ - ln(sqrt(1/(2k))).Simplify each term:First term: k*(1/(2k)) = 1/2.Second term: ln(sqrt(1/(2k))) = ln(1/sqrt(2k)) = ln(1) - ln(sqrt(2k)) = 0 - (1/2)ln(2k) = -(1/2)ln(2k).So, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k).We need this to be greater than 0:1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k) > 0.Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:1 - ln(2k) > 0  So, ln(2k) < 1.Exponentiate both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm:2k < e¬π  2k < e  Therefore, k < e/2.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that step. When I exponentiate both sides, since ln(2k) < 1, then 2k < e. So, k < e/2. That seems correct.But wait, earlier when I found the critical point, I assumed that k is positive because otherwise, the square root would not be real. So, k must be positive.Therefore, combining these results, k must be positive and less than e/2. So, k is in (0, e/2). But looking at the options, I don't see (0, e/2). The options are:A: (1/e, e)B: (1/(2e), 1/e)C: (-‚àû, -1/(2e))D: (1/(2e), +‚àû)Hmm, none of these is (0, e/2). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.Let me go back through the steps.First, f(x) = kx¬≤ - ln x.f'(x) = 2kx - 1/x.Set f'(x) = 0: 2kx = 1/x => 2kx¬≤ = 1 => x¬≤ = 1/(2k) => x = sqrt(1/(2k)).Then, f''(x) = 2k + 1/x¬≤, which is positive for k > 0, so it's a minimum.Compute f at the critical point:f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = k*(1/(2k)) - ln(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(1/(2k)).Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake in simplifying the logarithm term. Let me correct that.ln(sqrt(1/(2k))) = ln(1/sqrt(2k)) = ln(1) - ln(sqrt(2k)) = 0 - (1/2)ln(2k) = -(1/2)ln(2k). So that part was correct.So, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k).Set this greater than 0:1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k) > 0  Multiply both sides by 2: 1 - ln(2k) > 0  So, ln(2k) < 1  Exponentiate both sides: 2k < e  Thus, k < e/2.So, k must be less than e/2. But we also need to consider the behavior of f(x) as x approaches 0 and as x approaches infinity.As x approaches 0 from the right, ln x approaches negative infinity, so -ln x approaches positive infinity. Therefore, f(x) approaches positive infinity as x approaches 0. So, near x=0, f(x) is positive.As x approaches infinity, the term kx¬≤ dominates. If k > 0, then kx¬≤ approaches positive infinity, so f(x) approaches positive infinity. If k = 0, f(x) = -ln x, which approaches negative infinity as x approaches infinity, which is bad because we need f(x) > 0 always. If k < 0, then kx¬≤ approaches negative infinity, so f(x) approaches negative infinity as x approaches infinity, which is also bad.Therefore, k must be positive, and we already have k < e/2. So, k must be in (0, e/2). But the options don't include (0, e/2). Let me check the options again.A: (1/e, e)B: (1/(2e), 1/e)C: (-‚àû, -1/(2e))D: (1/(2e), +‚àû)Hmm, none of these is (0, e/2). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the logarithm term.Wait, let's re-express the condition:1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k) > 0  Multiply both sides by 2: 1 - ln(2k) > 0  So, ln(2k) < 1  Which implies 2k < e  So, k < e/2.But also, we need to ensure that the function is defined. Since x = sqrt(1/(2k)) must be a real positive number, 2k must be positive, so k > 0.Therefore, k must satisfy 0 < k < e/2.But the options don't have this. Let me see if I can express e/2 in terms of 1/(2e). Wait, e is approximately 2.718, so e/2 is approximately 1.359, and 1/(2e) is approximately 0.1839.So, 0 < k < e/2 is approximately 0 < k < 1.359.Looking at the options, D is (1/(2e), +‚àû), which is approximately (0.1839, +‚àû). So, our result is (0, e/2), but the closest option is D, which is (1/(2e), +‚àû). However, our result is that k must be less than e/2, but D says k must be greater than 1/(2e). So, is there a contradiction?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me double-check.We have:1 - ln(2k) > 0  So, ln(2k) < 1  Therefore, 2k < e  So, k < e/2.But we also need to ensure that the function is positive for all x > 0. So, if k is too small, maybe the function dips below zero somewhere else.Wait, but we found that the minimum occurs at x = sqrt(1/(2k)), and the minimum value is 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k). So, to ensure that this minimum is positive, we have k < e/2.But if k is too small, say approaching zero, what happens? Let's see.If k approaches zero, then the minimum value is 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k). As k approaches zero, ln(2k) approaches negative infinity, so -(1/2)ln(2k) approaches positive infinity. Therefore, the minimum value approaches positive infinity. So, actually, for very small k, the function is still positive everywhere.Wait, that seems contradictory. If k is very small, the function is dominated by the -ln x term near x=0, but as x increases, the kx¬≤ term becomes negligible. Wait, no, as x increases, kx¬≤ grows if k is positive, but if k is very small, it might not dominate the -ln x term.Wait, let me test with k approaching zero. Let's take k = 0.0001, which is positive but very small.f(x) = 0.0001 x¬≤ - ln x.As x approaches zero, ln x approaches negative infinity, so -ln x approaches positive infinity, so f(x) approaches positive infinity.As x approaches infinity, 0.0001 x¬≤ grows to positive infinity, so f(x) approaches positive infinity.But what about in between? Let's find the minimum.x = sqrt(1/(2k)) = sqrt(1/(2*0.0001)) = sqrt(5000) ‚âà 70.71.Compute f(70.71):f(70.71) = 0.0001*(70.71)^2 - ln(70.71) ‚âà 0.0001*5000 - ln(70.71) ‚âà 0.5 - 4.257 ‚âà -3.757.Wait, that's negative. So, even though k is positive, if k is too small, the function can dip below zero. So, my earlier conclusion that k can be as small as approaching zero is incorrect.Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assuming that the minimum is at x = sqrt(1/(2k)) and that the minimum value is 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k). Wait, let me recalculate f at the critical point.f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = k*(sqrt(1/(2k)))^2 - ln(sqrt(1/(2k))).Compute each term:First term: k*(1/(2k)) = 1/2.Second term: ln(sqrt(1/(2k))) = (1/2)ln(1/(2k)) = (1/2)(-ln(2k)) = -(1/2)ln(2k).So, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k).Wait, that's correct. So, if k is too small, ln(2k) becomes negative, so -(1/2)ln(2k) becomes positive, making the minimum value larger. But in my test case with k=0.0001, the minimum was negative. That contradicts.Wait, let's compute ln(2k) when k=0.0001:ln(2*0.0001) = ln(0.0002) ‚âà ln(2*10^{-4}) ‚âà ln(2) + ln(10^{-4}) ‚âà 0.6931 - 9.2103 ‚âà -8.5172.So, -(1/2)ln(2k) ‚âà -(1/2)*(-8.5172) ‚âà 4.2586.Therefore, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) ‚âà 1/2 + 4.2586 ‚âà 4.7586, which is positive. But in my earlier calculation, I got f(70.71) ‚âà -3.757, which is negative. That's a contradiction.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating f(70.71). Let me recalculate.f(70.71) = 0.0001*(70.71)^2 - ln(70.71).Compute 0.0001*(70.71)^2:70.71^2 ‚âà 5000, so 0.0001*5000 = 0.5.Compute ln(70.71):ln(70.71) ‚âà 4.257.So, f(70.71) ‚âà 0.5 - 4.257 ‚âà -3.757.But according to the formula, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) ‚âà 4.7586. How is that possible?Wait, sqrt(1/(2k)) when k=0.0001 is sqrt(1/(0.0002)) = sqrt(5000) ‚âà 70.71. So, f(70.71) should be 4.7586, but my direct calculation gave -3.757. That's a big discrepancy.Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of f(sqrt(1/(2k))). Let me compute f(70.71) again.f(70.71) = 0.0001*(70.71)^2 - ln(70.71).Compute 0.0001*(70.71)^2:70.71^2 = 5000 (approximately), so 0.0001*5000 = 0.5.Compute ln(70.71):ln(70.71) ‚âà 4.257.So, f(70.71) ‚âà 0.5 - 4.257 ‚âà -3.757.But according to the formula, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k).Compute ln(2k) when k=0.0001:ln(2*0.0001) = ln(0.0002) ‚âà -8.517.So, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 0.5 - (1/2)*(-8.517) ‚âà 0.5 + 4.258 ‚âà 4.758.But this contradicts the direct calculation. So, where is the mistake?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(sqrt(1/(2k))). Let me rederive it.f(x) = kx¬≤ - ln x.At x = sqrt(1/(2k)), x¬≤ = 1/(2k).So, f(x) = k*(1/(2k)) - ln(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 - (1/2)ln(1/(2k)).But ln(1/(2k)) = -ln(2k), so f(x) = 1/2 - (1/2)*(-ln(2k)) = 1/2 + (1/2)ln(2k).Wait, that's different from what I had before. I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier.So, f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 + (1/2)ln(2k).Ah, that's the mistake. Earlier, I thought it was 1/2 - (1/2)ln(2k), but it's actually 1/2 + (1/2)ln(2k).So, the correct expression is:f(sqrt(1/(2k))) = 1/2 + (1/2)ln(2k).Therefore, the condition is:1/2 + (1/2)ln(2k) > 0.Multiply both sides by 2:1 + ln(2k) > 0  So, ln(2k) > -1  Exponentiate both sides:2k > e^{-1}  So, k > e^{-1}/2 = 1/(2e).Therefore, k must be greater than 1/(2e).So, the range of k is (1/(2e), +‚àû).Looking back at the options, D is (1/(2e), +‚àû), which matches our result.So, the correct answer is D.But let me verify this with the earlier test case where k=0.0001, which is less than 1/(2e) ‚âà 0.1839. So, k=0.0001 is less than 1/(2e), and indeed, when I computed f(70.71), it was negative, which is consistent with the condition that k must be greater than 1/(2e) to ensure f(x) > 0 for all x > 0.Another test case: let's take k=1/(2e) ‚âà 0.1839.Compute f(sqrt(1/(2k))):First, compute 2k = 2*(1/(2e)) = 1/e.So, sqrt(1/(2k)) = sqrt(e).Compute f(sqrt(e)):f(sqrt(e)) = k*(sqrt(e))¬≤ - ln(sqrt(e)) = k*e - (1/2)ln(e) = (1/(2e))*e - (1/2)*1 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.So, at k=1/(2e), the minimum value is 0, which is the boundary case. Therefore, for k > 1/(2e), the minimum value is positive, ensuring f(x) > 0 for all x > 0.Therefore, the correct range of k is (1/(2e), +‚àû), which is option D."},{"question":"Lucy has 4 sisters and 3 brothers.

Upon reaching the end of the diagonal, each runner immediately turns back. They started simultaneously from two randomly chosen points on their diagonals. Prove that there will be a moment when the distance between the runners will be strictly less than half the length of the diagonal of the square.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two runners on the diagonals of a square. They start at random points on their respective diagonals and run at the same constant speed. When they reach the end of a diagonal, they turn back immediately. I need to prove that at some point, the distance between them will be strictly less than half the length of the diagonal.Hmm, let me visualize the square first. Let's say the square is ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O, which is the center of the square. Both diagonals are equal in length, and they bisect each other at 90 degrees because it's a square.So, Runner 1 is on diagonal AC, and Runner 2 is on diagonal BD. They start at some random points on their diagonals. Since the square is symmetric, maybe I can assume without loss of generality that Runner 1 starts somewhere on AC and Runner 2 starts somewhere on BD. Their speeds are equal, so whatever happens, the time it takes for them to reach the end of their diagonals is the same.Wait, but they start at different points, so their initial distances to the ends of their diagonals might be different. But since they turn around immediately upon reaching the end, their paths are just back and forth along their respective diagonals.I need to show that at some moment, the distance between them is less than half the diagonal. Let me denote the length of the diagonal as d. So, half the diagonal is d/2. I need to show that at some point, the distance between Runner 1 and Runner 2 is less than d/2.Maybe I can model their positions as functions of time. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place the square ABCD with coordinates: A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1), D at (0,1). Then the diagonals AC and BD have lengths sqrt(2), so half the diagonal is sqrt(2)/2.Wait, actually, if the square has side length 1, then the diagonal length is sqrt(2). So half the diagonal is sqrt(2)/2. But maybe it's easier to consider the square with side length sqrt(2), so that the diagonal is 2, making half the diagonal equal to 1. That might simplify the calculations.Alternatively, maybe I can just keep the side length as 1 and work with sqrt(2) as the diagonal. Let me stick with side length 1 for simplicity.So, Runner 1 is moving along AC from some starting point, and Runner 2 is moving along BD from some starting point. Both are moving at the same constant speed. Let's denote their speed as v.Since they start at random points, let's parameterize their starting positions. Let me denote the starting position of Runner 1 as a point along AC. Since AC is a diagonal from (0,0) to (1,1), any point on AC can be represented as (t, t) where t is between 0 and 1. Similarly, any point on BD can be represented as (1 - s, s) where s is between 0 and 1.Wait, actually, BD goes from (1,0) to (0,1), so a point on BD can be represented as (1 - s, s) where s is between 0 and 1. So, Runner 1 starts at (t, t) and Runner 2 starts at (1 - s, s). Both t and s are between 0 and 1, chosen randomly.Now, since they are moving at constant speed v along their respective diagonals, their positions as functions of time can be described. Let me denote the time variable as œÑ.For Runner 1, moving along AC: starting at (t, t). The direction depends on whether they are moving towards A or C. But since they start at a random point, they could be moving in either direction. Similarly, Runner 2 on BD could be moving towards B or D.Wait, but the problem states that upon reaching the end of the diagonal, they turn back. So, if Runner 1 starts closer to A, they will move towards C, and upon reaching C, turn back towards A. Similarly, if they start closer to C, they will move towards A, and upon reaching A, turn back towards C. The same applies to Runner 2 on BD.But since their starting points are random, we don't know their initial direction. Hmm, this complicates things a bit.Maybe instead of tracking their direction, I can model their position as a function of time, considering the periodic nature of their motion. Since they turn around immediately upon reaching the end, their motion is periodic with a period equal to the time it takes to traverse the diagonal twice (once in each direction).Let me calculate the time it takes to traverse the diagonal. The length of the diagonal is sqrt(2), so the time to go from one end to the other is sqrt(2)/v. Therefore, the period of their motion is 2*sqrt(2)/v.But perhaps I can normalize the speed so that v = 1 for simplicity. Then the time to traverse the diagonal is sqrt(2), and the period is 2*sqrt(2).Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize their positions using a parameter that goes from 0 to 1, representing their position along the diagonal, and then use modulo 2 to account for the back-and-forth motion.Wait, let me think differently. Since both runners are moving at the same speed along their respective diagonals, which are of equal length, their motion is symmetric in some sense.If I consider the square's center O, which is the intersection point of the diagonals, maybe I can analyze their positions relative to O.Suppose at time œÑ, Runner 1 is at position P1 on AC, and Runner 2 is at position P2 on BD. The distance between P1 and P2 is what we're interested in.We need to show that there exists some œÑ where the distance between P1 and P2 is less than d/2, where d is the length of the diagonal.Wait, but d is sqrt(2), so d/2 is sqrt(2)/2. So, we need to show that at some point, the distance between them is less than sqrt(2)/2.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle or some continuity argument.Since both runners are moving continuously, their distance apart is also a continuous function of time. If we can show that at some point, this distance must dip below sqrt(2)/2, then we're done.Alternatively, maybe I can consider their positions relative to O. Since O is the midpoint, if both runners are on the same side of O, their distance apart might be smaller.Wait, but they are on different diagonals, so their positions relative to O might not directly translate to their distance apart.Let me try to model their positions mathematically.Let me denote the position of Runner 1 as a function of time. Let's say Runner 1 starts at position t along AC, where t is between 0 and 1 (with 0 at A and 1 at C). Similarly, Runner 2 starts at position s along BD, where s is between 0 and 1 (with 0 at B and 1 at D).Since they move at speed v, their position along their respective diagonals can be given by:For Runner 1: position = t + v*œÑ mod 2 (since they go back and forth)But actually, since the diagonal length is sqrt(2), and their speed is v, the time to traverse the diagonal is sqrt(2)/v. So, their position can be modeled as a sawtooth wave.Alternatively, maybe it's better to parameterize their positions using a parameter that goes from 0 to 1, representing their position along the diagonal, and then use a function that reflects their back-and-forth motion.Let me denote the position of Runner 1 as:p1(œÑ) = t + œÑ mod 2, but adjusted to wrap around the diagonal.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of distance from A for Runner 1 and distance from B for Runner 2.But since they turn around upon reaching the end, their distance from the starting point will oscillate.Wait, perhaps I can model their positions as functions that go from 0 to sqrt(2) and back, repeatedly.But this might get complicated. Maybe instead, I can consider their positions relative to O.Let me think about their positions in terms of vectors. Since AC and BD are perpendicular, their positions can be represented in a coordinate system where O is the origin.Wait, actually, in the coordinate system I set up earlier, O is at (0.5, 0.5). So, Runner 1 is moving along the line from (0,0) to (1,1), and Runner 2 is moving along the line from (1,0) to (0,1).Let me parameterize their positions.For Runner 1, starting at (t, t), moving towards either (1,1) or (0,0) depending on the starting point. Similarly for Runner 2.But since they can start anywhere, maybe I can consider their positions as functions that oscillate between the ends of their diagonals.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the relative motion. Since both runners are moving at the same speed, perhaps their relative speed is zero, but that might not be the case because they are moving along different paths.Wait, no, their relative speed depends on their directions. If they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is 2v, but if they are moving away, it's 0.Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me consider the distance between them as a function of time. Since both runners are moving at constant speed along straight lines, their distance apart will vary continuously. If I can show that this distance function must reach a minimum value less than d/2, then I'm done.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the square is symmetric and consider the possible positions of the runners relative to each other.Wait, another idea: since both runners are moving along the diagonals, which intersect at O, maybe I can consider their positions relative to O and show that at some point, both are on the same side of O, making their distance apart less than d/2.But I'm not sure if that's necessarily true. They could be on opposite sides of O and still have a distance greater than d/2.Wait, actually, if both runners are on the same side of O, their distance apart would be less than d/2, because the maximum distance between two points on the same side of O along the diagonals would be less than d/2.But if they are on opposite sides, their distance apart could be up to d.Wait, let me think about that. If Runner 1 is at A and Runner 2 is at B, their distance apart is sqrt(2), which is the full diagonal. But if Runner 1 is at O and Runner 2 is at O, their distance apart is 0. So, the distance varies between 0 and sqrt(2).But we need to show that it's strictly less than sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Wait, maybe I can use the intermediate value theorem. If at some point their distance is greater than sqrt(2)/2 and at another point it's less, then it must cross sqrt(2)/2. But I need to ensure that it actually does cross below.Alternatively, maybe I can consider their positions over time and show that their paths must intersect or come close enough.Wait, another approach: since both runners are moving along the diagonals, which are perpendicular, their paths form a coordinate system. Maybe I can model their positions as points in this coordinate system and analyze their distance.Let me try to set up a coordinate system where O is the origin, and the diagonals AC and BD are the x and y axes, respectively. Then, Runner 1 is moving along the x-axis, and Runner 2 is moving along the y-axis.In this coordinate system, the square's vertices are at (sqrt(2)/2, 0), (0, sqrt(2)/2), (-sqrt(2)/2, 0), and (0, -sqrt(2)/2). Wait, no, actually, the diagonals of the square are of length sqrt(2), so half the diagonal is sqrt(2)/2. So, in this coordinate system, the square's vertices would be at (sqrt(2)/2, 0), (0, sqrt(2)/2), (-sqrt(2)/2, 0), and (0, -sqrt(2)/2).But maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, I can keep the original coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (1,0), etc., and model their positions accordingly.Wait, perhaps I can consider the positions of Runner 1 and Runner 2 as functions of time and then compute the distance between them.Let me denote the position of Runner 1 as (x1(t), y1(t)) and Runner 2 as (x2(t), y2(t)). Since Runner 1 is on AC, which goes from (0,0) to (1,1), their position can be expressed as (a(t), a(t)), where a(t) is a function representing their position along AC. Similarly, Runner 2 is on BD, which goes from (1,0) to (0,1), so their position can be expressed as (1 - b(t), b(t)), where b(t) is a function representing their position along BD.Since both runners move at the same speed, the functions a(t) and b(t) will have the same rate of change, but their starting points are different.Wait, but they start at different points, so a(0) = t and b(0) = s, where t and s are between 0 and 1.But since they turn around upon reaching the end, their motion is periodic. So, a(t) and b(t) will be sawtooth functions that go from 0 to 1 and back to 0, repeatedly.But this might be complicated to model. Maybe I can consider their positions modulo 1, but adjusted for the back-and-forth motion.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the distance between them as a function of time and show that it must reach a minimum less than d/2.Let me compute the distance between Runner 1 and Runner 2 at time t.The distance squared is:D(t)^2 = (x1(t) - x2(t))^2 + (y1(t) - y2(t))^2Substituting the positions:= (a(t) - (1 - b(t)))^2 + (a(t) - b(t))^2Simplify:= (a(t) + b(t) - 1)^2 + (a(t) - b(t))^2Expanding both terms:= [ (a(t) + b(t) - 1)^2 ] + [ (a(t) - b(t))^2 ]= [ (a(t)^2 + 2a(t)b(t) + b(t)^2 - 2a(t) - 2b(t) + 1) ] + [ (a(t)^2 - 2a(t)b(t) + b(t)^2) ]Combine like terms:= a(t)^2 + 2a(t)b(t) + b(t)^2 - 2a(t) - 2b(t) + 1 + a(t)^2 - 2a(t)b(t) + b(t)^2Simplify:= 2a(t)^2 + 2b(t)^2 - 2a(t) - 2b(t) + 1So, D(t)^2 = 2a(t)^2 + 2b(t)^2 - 2a(t) - 2b(t) + 1Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can analyze this expression.Since both a(t) and b(t) are functions that oscillate between 0 and 1, their squares will be between 0 and 1 as well.But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I can consider the minimum value of D(t)^2.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the positions of Runner 1 and Runner 2 relative to O.Let me denote the position of Runner 1 as (a, a) and Runner 2 as (1 - b, b). Then, the vector from Runner 1 to Runner 2 is (1 - b - a, b - a).The distance squared is (1 - b - a)^2 + (b - a)^2.Expanding:= (1 - a - b)^2 + (b - a)^2= (1 - 2a - 2b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)= 1 - 2a - 2b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + a^2 - 2ab + b^2= 1 - 2a - 2b + 2a^2 + 2b^2So, D^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 - 2a - 2b + 1This is the same expression as before.Now, to find the minimum distance, I can take the derivative of D^2 with respect to time and set it to zero, but since a(t) and b(t) are functions that change at constant speed, their derivatives are constants.Wait, but a(t) and b(t) are not necessarily increasing or decreasing at the same rate because they might be moving in opposite directions depending on their starting points.This is getting complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me consider the relative motion. Since both runners are moving at the same speed, perhaps their relative speed is zero, but that might not be the case because they are moving along different paths.Wait, no, their relative speed depends on their directions. If they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is 2v, but if they are moving away, it's 0.But since they are on perpendicular paths, their relative velocity vector is the vector sum of their individual velocities.Wait, maybe I can model their relative velocity.Let me denote the velocity of Runner 1 as v1 and Runner 2 as v2. Since they are moving along AC and BD, which are perpendicular, their velocity vectors are perpendicular.So, the relative velocity vector is v1 - v2, but since they are moving along different axes, the relative velocity has components in both directions.But I'm not sure if this helps directly.Wait, another idea: since both runners are moving along the diagonals, which are perpendicular, their positions can be considered as points moving along the x and y axes in a rotated coordinate system.In this rotated system, Runner 1 is moving along the x-axis, and Runner 2 is moving along the y-axis. Their distance apart is then the Euclidean distance between their positions on the axes.Since they are moving at the same speed, their positions on the axes are functions that oscillate between 0 and sqrt(2)/2 (half the diagonal) and back.Wait, but in this rotated system, the distance between them is sqrt(x^2 + y^2), where x and y are their positions along the axes.If I can show that at some point, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt(2)/2, then I'm done.But since x and y are both oscillating between 0 and sqrt(2)/2, their sum of squares might sometimes be less than (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.Wait, let's compute (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.So, if x^2 + y^2 < 0.5, then sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt(0.5) = sqrt(2)/2.So, I need to show that x^2 + y^2 < 0.5 at some point.But x and y are both functions that oscillate between 0 and sqrt(2)/2. So, their squares oscillate between 0 and 0.5.But how can I ensure that their sum is less than 0.5?Wait, consider that when one is at 0, the other is at some point, and vice versa. But since they start at random points, maybe their positions are not synchronized.Wait, actually, since they start at random points, their initial positions are independent. So, it's possible that at some point, both x and y are less than sqrt(2)/2, making their squares sum to less than 0.5.But I need to make this more precise.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that their motion is periodic and consider their positions over time.Since both runners are moving at the same speed, their positions along their diagonals are periodic with the same period. Therefore, their relative positions are also periodic.In such a case, the distance between them must achieve its minimum value at some point within the period.So, if I can show that the minimum distance is less than sqrt(2)/2, then I'm done.But how can I compute this minimum?Wait, maybe I can consider the worst-case scenario where their starting positions are such that their distance is maximized. Then, show that even in this case, the distance must dip below sqrt(2)/2.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of their distances from O must sometimes be less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, let me think about their positions relative to O.If Runner 1 is at position a along AC, then their distance from O is |a - 0.5| * sqrt(2). Similarly, Runner 2's distance from O is |b - 0.5| * sqrt(2).Wait, no, actually, since AC has length sqrt(2), the distance from O is |a - 0.5| * sqrt(2). Similarly for Runner 2.But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, another idea: consider the positions of Runner 1 and Runner 2 as points moving along the x and y axes in the rotated coordinate system. Then, their distance apart is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Since they are moving at the same speed, the relative motion is such that x and y are both linear functions of time, but with possible direction changes when they reach the ends.But since they turn around immediately, their motion is periodic.Wait, maybe I can consider their motion as moving back and forth along the axes, and their positions as functions that go from 0 to sqrt(2)/2 and back.In this case, the distance between them is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). To find the minimum distance, I can consider the minimum of this function over time.But since x and y are both oscillating, their squares will also oscillate, and their sum will oscillate as well.I need to show that this sum is less than 0.5 at some point.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 and show that it must be less than 0.5 at some t.But since x(t) and y(t) are both bounded between 0 and sqrt(2)/2, their squares are between 0 and 0.5.But how can I ensure that their sum is less than 0.5?Wait, consider that when one is at its maximum, the other is at its minimum, and vice versa. So, if x(t) is at sqrt(2)/2, then y(t) is at 0, and vice versa. In this case, x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5.But we need to show that it's strictly less than 0.5 at some point.Wait, but if they start at points where x(0) and y(0) are both greater than 0, then as they move, their positions will change, and at some point, one will be decreasing while the other is increasing.Wait, maybe I can use the intermediate value theorem. Suppose that at time t1, x(t1) is increasing and y(t1) is decreasing, and at time t2, x(t2) is decreasing and y(t2) is increasing. Then, there must be some time in between where x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 is less than 0.5.But I'm not sure if this is rigorous enough.Wait, another approach: consider the function f(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2. Since x(t) and y(t) are continuous and periodic, f(t) is also continuous and periodic. Therefore, f(t) must attain its minimum value over the period.If I can show that the minimum value of f(t) is less than 0.5, then we're done.But how can I compute this minimum?Wait, maybe I can consider the relative motion. Since both runners are moving at the same speed, their relative position is such that x(t) + y(t) is constant or something like that.Wait, no, their relative motion is more complex because they are moving along perpendicular paths.Wait, perhaps I can consider the positions of Runner 1 and Runner 2 as points moving along the x and y axes, and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides x(t) and y(t).If I can show that at some point, x(t) + y(t) < sqrt(2)/2, then by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, sqrt(x(t)^2 + y(t)^2) <= x(t) + y(t) < sqrt(2)/2.But wait, that's not correct because the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that sqrt(x^2 + y^2) <= sqrt(2)(x + y)/2, which is not helpful here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 <= (x(t) + y(t))^2 / 2 by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: consider the function f(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2. Since x(t) and y(t) are both functions that oscillate between 0 and sqrt(2)/2, their squares oscillate between 0 and 0.5.But the sum x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 will oscillate between 0 and 1.Wait, but we need to show that it's less than 0.5 at some point.Wait, consider that when Runner 1 is at O, x(t) = sqrt(2)/2 / 2 = sqrt(2)/4, and similarly for Runner 2. Wait, no, O is the midpoint, so if Runner 1 is at O, x(t) = sqrt(2)/2 / 2 = sqrt(2)/4? Wait, no, the length from A to O is sqrt(2)/2, so if Runner 1 is at O, their position is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), but in the rotated coordinate system, that would be (sqrt(2)/2, 0). Wait, I'm getting confused.Maybe I need to clarify the coordinate system.Let me redefine the coordinate system such that O is the origin, and the diagonals AC and BD are the x and y axes, respectively. Then, the square's vertices are at (sqrt(2)/2, 0), (0, sqrt(2)/2), (-sqrt(2)/2, 0), and (0, -sqrt(2)/2).In this system, Runner 1 is moving along the x-axis from (-sqrt(2)/2, 0) to (sqrt(2)/2, 0) and back, and Runner 2 is moving along the y-axis from (0, -sqrt(2)/2) to (0, sqrt(2)/2) and back.Their positions can be represented as (x(t), 0) and (0, y(t)), respectively.The distance between them is sqrt(x(t)^2 + y(t)^2).Since both runners are moving at the same speed, their positions x(t) and y(t) are functions that oscillate between -sqrt(2)/2 and sqrt(2)/2.But since they start at random points, x(0) and y(0) are random values between -sqrt(2)/2 and sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but in this coordinate system, their starting points are on the diagonals, so x(0) and y(0) are between -sqrt(2)/2 and sqrt(2)/2.But since they are moving at constant speed, their positions are linear functions of time, except when they turn around.Wait, but in this coordinate system, their motion is symmetric, so maybe I can consider their positions as functions that go from -sqrt(2)/2 to sqrt(2)/2 and back.But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can consider specific cases.Case 1: Both runners start at O. Then, their distance apart is 0, which is less than sqrt(2)/2.Case 2: Runner 1 starts at A (x = -sqrt(2)/2) and Runner 2 starts at B (y = -sqrt(2)/2). Then, as they start moving towards C and D respectively, their distance apart increases. But as they pass through O, their distance apart becomes 0 again.Wait, but in this case, their distance apart is 0 at O, which is less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but what if they start at points such that their initial distance is greater than sqrt(2)/2?For example, Runner 1 starts near C and Runner 2 starts near D. Then, their initial distance is almost sqrt(2), which is greater than sqrt(2)/2. But as they move towards O, their distance apart decreases.So, at some point, they must pass through O, making their distance 0, which is less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but what if they don't pass through O? For example, if Runner 1 starts near C and Runner 2 starts near B, then as Runner 1 moves towards A and Runner 2 moves towards D, their paths might not cross O at the same time.Wait, but since they are moving at the same speed, if Runner 1 is moving towards A and Runner 2 is moving towards D, their positions relative to O will change over time.Wait, maybe I can consider their positions as functions of time and solve for when their distance apart is less than sqrt(2)/2.Let me denote the position of Runner 1 as x(t) and Runner 2 as y(t). Since they are moving at speed v, their positions can be expressed as:x(t) = x0 + v*t (mod 2*sqrt(2)/v)Similarly for y(t).But this is getting too involved. Maybe I can use a geometric argument.Consider the square and the two diagonals. The diagonals intersect at O. If both runners are on the same side of O, their distance apart is less than sqrt(2)/2. If they are on opposite sides, their distance apart is greater than sqrt(2)/2.But since they are moving at the same speed, their positions relative to O will change over time. At some point, they must be on the same side of O, making their distance apart less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, is that necessarily true? Suppose Runner 1 is moving towards C and Runner 2 is moving towards D. If they start on opposite sides of O, they might pass through O at different times, but their paths are along different diagonals.Wait, actually, since they are moving along different diagonals, their relative positions can be such that they are on the same side or opposite sides of O at different times.But since their motion is continuous, their relative positions must pass through all possible configurations, including being on the same side of O.Therefore, at some point, both runners must be on the same side of O, making their distance apart less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but how can I formalize this?Maybe I can consider the function that represents their relative positions and show that it must cross the threshold where they are on the same side of O.Alternatively, maybe I can use the intermediate value theorem. If at time t1, Runner 1 is on one side of O and Runner 2 is on the opposite side, and at time t2, they are both on the same side, then there must be some time in between where their distance apart is less than sqrt(2)/2.But I'm not sure if this is rigorous enough.Wait, another idea: consider the function f(t) = (x(t) - y(t))^2. Since x(t) and y(t) are continuous functions, f(t) is also continuous. If f(t) is ever less than (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5, then the distance is less than sqrt(2)/2.But I need to show that f(t) must be less than 0.5 at some point.Wait, but f(t) is the square of the distance between them, so if I can show that f(t) < 0.5, then the distance is less than sqrt(0.5) = sqrt(2)/2.But how can I ensure that f(t) is less than 0.5?Wait, consider that when Runner 1 is at O, x(t) = 0, and similarly for Runner 2. If Runner 1 is at O, then f(t) = y(t)^2. If Runner 2 is also near O, then y(t) is small, making f(t) small.But if Runner 2 is far from O when Runner 1 is at O, then f(t) could be large.Wait, but since both runners are moving at the same speed, their positions relative to O are changing continuously. So, if Runner 1 is at O, Runner 2 must have been somewhere else, but as they move, they will eventually align in such a way that their distance apart is small.Wait, maybe I can consider the relative motion. Since both runners are moving at the same speed along perpendicular paths, their relative velocity vector is such that they are moving towards or away from each other at a certain rate.But I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: consider the time it takes for Runner 1 to go from one end to the other, which is T = sqrt(2)/v. Similarly for Runner 2.Since they start at random points, their initial positions are random along their diagonals. Therefore, the time it takes for them to reach O is also random.But since they are moving at the same speed, the time it takes for Runner 1 to reach O is (distance from Runner 1 to O)/v, and similarly for Runner 2.If their times to reach O are different, then at some point, one will be at O while the other is not. But even if they reach O at the same time, their distance apart would be 0, which is less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but if they reach O at different times, then at the time when one is at O, the other is somewhere else, but their distance apart would be the distance from O to the other runner.Since the other runner is moving at speed v, the distance from O would be |v*(t - t0)|, where t0 is the time when the other runner passed O.But since they started at random times, this distance could be anything.Wait, maybe I need to consider that over time, their positions will overlap or come close enough.Wait, another idea: since both runners are moving along the diagonals, which are perpendicular, their paths form a coordinate system. The set of all possible positions of Runner 1 and Runner 2 can be represented as points in this coordinate system.The distance between them is the Euclidean distance between these points. Since they are moving at the same speed, their relative motion is such that their positions are changing in a way that their distance apart must vary.But I'm not sure how to proceed.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the product of their positions is periodic, and therefore, their distance apart must achieve all possible values between 0 and sqrt(2).But I need to show that it must be less than sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Wait, consider that the maximum distance between them is sqrt(2), which occurs when they are at opposite corners. The minimum distance is 0, which occurs when they meet at O.Since their motion is continuous, their distance apart must take on all values between 0 and sqrt(2). Therefore, it must be less than sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Wait, but is that necessarily true? Just because the distance varies between 0 and sqrt(2) doesn't automatically mean it must pass through every value in between. However, by the intermediate value theorem, if the distance is continuous and takes on values both less than and greater than sqrt(2)/2, then it must equal sqrt(2)/2 at some point.But we need to show that it is strictly less than sqrt(2)/2 at some point, not just equal to it.Wait, but if the distance is continuous and starts above sqrt(2)/2, then as they move towards each other, the distance must decrease below sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Similarly, if they start below, it might go above, but we need to ensure that it must go below at some point.Wait, but since they are moving at the same speed along perpendicular paths, their relative motion is such that their distance apart can both increase and decrease.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can consider specific examples.Example 1: Runner 1 starts at A and Runner 2 starts at B. As they move towards C and D respectively, their distance apart decreases until they meet at O, where the distance is 0. So, in this case, the distance is less than sqrt(2)/2.Example 2: Runner 1 starts near C and Runner 2 starts near D. As they move towards A and B respectively, their distance apart decreases until they meet at O, again with distance 0.Example 3: Runner 1 starts at O and Runner 2 starts at O. Their distance is 0.Example 4: Runner 1 starts at A and Runner 2 starts at D. As Runner 1 moves towards C and Runner 2 moves towards B, their distance apart changes. At some point, they will be on the same side of O, making their distance less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, but in all these examples, the distance does become less than sqrt(2)/2. So, maybe in general, it's always true.But how can I formalize this?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the runners are moving along perpendicular lines, and their relative motion causes their distance apart to vary in a way that must dip below sqrt(2)/2.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. Since they are moving along two perpendicular lines, their positions must overlap or come close enough at some point.Wait, another idea: consider the function f(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2. Since x(t) and y(t) are both oscillating functions, their squares will also oscillate. The sum x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 will have a minimum value.If I can show that this minimum is less than 0.5, then sqrt(x(t)^2 + y(t)^2) < sqrt(0.5) = sqrt(2)/2.But how can I find the minimum of f(t)?Wait, since x(t) and y(t) are both periodic functions with the same period, their sum f(t) is also periodic. Therefore, it must attain its minimum value within one period.If I can compute the minimum of f(t), I can show that it's less than 0.5.But without knowing the exact functions x(t) and y(t), it's difficult to compute the minimum.Wait, maybe I can consider the worst-case scenario where x(t) and y(t) are as far apart as possible.But I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: consider the relative velocity. Since both runners are moving at speed v along perpendicular paths, their relative velocity vector has components v in both x and y directions.Wait, no, their relative velocity is the vector difference of their velocities. Since Runner 1 is moving along x-axis and Runner 2 along y-axis, their relative velocity is (v, -v), assuming they are moving in the positive directions.But the magnitude of this relative velocity is sqrt(v^2 + v^2) = v*sqrt(2).This means that the distance between them is changing at a rate of v*sqrt(2) when they are moving directly towards or away from each other.But since they are moving along perpendicular paths, their relative velocity is such that the distance between them can both increase and decrease.Wait, but if they start at points where their initial distance is greater than sqrt(2)/2, then as they move, their distance will decrease until they pass each other, and then increase again.Therefore, at some point, their distance must be less than sqrt(2)/2.Wait, that seems promising. If their initial distance is greater than sqrt(2)/2, then as they move towards each other, their distance decreases, passing through sqrt(2)/2, reaching a minimum, and then increasing again.Therefore, there must be a moment when their distance is exactly sqrt(2)/2, and moments before and after where it's less.But we need to show that it's strictly less than sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Wait, but if their initial distance is exactly sqrt(2)/2, then as they move, their distance will decrease below it.Wait, actually, regardless of their starting positions, their distance must vary in such a way that it must dip below sqrt(2)/2 at some point.Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, since their distance is continuous and can both increase and decrease, it must pass through every value between its minimum and maximum, including values less than sqrt(2)/2.Therefore, there must be a moment when their distance is strictly less than sqrt(2)/2.I think this is the key idea. Since their motion is continuous and their relative positions cause their distance to vary, it must achieve all values between its minimum and maximum, including values below sqrt(2)/2.So, putting it all together, regardless of their starting positions, the continuous motion of the runners along their respective diagonals ensures that their distance apart must at some point be less than half the diagonal's length."},{"question":"Wynter went to her local town bike shop to buy her sister a bicycle as her birthday gift. While at the shop, Wynter counted 50 bicycles and some tricycles. The vehicles she saw had a total of 160 wheels. How many tricycles did she count?","answer":"First, I recognize that there are 50 bicycles in the shop. Since each bicycle has 2 wheels, the total number of wheels from bicycles is 50 multiplied by 2, which equals 100 wheels.Next, I let ( T ) represent the number of tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 wheels, so the total number of wheels from tricycles is ( 3T ).The problem states that the total number of wheels from both bicycles and tricycles is 160. I can set up the equation:[100 + 3T = 160]To find the value of ( T ), I subtract 100 from both sides of the equation:[3T = 60]Finally, I divide both sides by 3 to solve for ( T ):[T = 20]Therefore, Wynter counted 20 tricycles at the bike shop."},{"question":"Rectangle LMNO is a 4 times 5 rectangle with LM=MQ=QP=PO=1. Calculate the area of the shaded regions formed by connecting Q to O and P to L.A) 3B) 3.5C) 4D) 4.5","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangle LMNO that's 4 units by 5 units. The sides LM, MQ, QP, and PO are each 1 unit long. I need to find the area of the shaded regions formed by connecting point Q to O and point P to L. The options are A) 3, B) 3.5, C) 4, D) 4.5. Hmm, let's try to visualize this.First, I should probably sketch the rectangle to get a better idea. Let me imagine the rectangle with points labeled L, M, N, O. Since it's a 4x5 rectangle, I can assume that the length LM is 4 units and the width MN is 5 units. But wait, the problem says LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1. That seems a bit confusing because if LM is 1, but the rectangle is 4 units long, that doesn't add up. Maybe I misread the problem.Wait, no, the rectangle is 4x5, so maybe LM is 4 units, and MQ, QP, PO are each 1 unit. That makes more sense. So, starting from point L, moving to M is 4 units, then from M to Q is 1 unit, Q to P is another unit, and P to O is another unit. So, the total length from L to O would be 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 units? But that contradicts the rectangle being 4x5. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the labeling of the rectangle.Perhaps the rectangle is labeled such that LM is one side, say the length, which is 4 units, and then MQ, QP, PO are segments along another side, which is 5 units. So, if LM is 4 units, then MQ, QP, PO being 1 unit each would mean that from M, moving up 1 unit to Q, another unit to P, and another unit to O. So, O would be 3 units above M. But the rectangle is 5 units in height, so that leaves 2 units from O to N. Hmm, maybe.Let me try to assign coordinates to each point to make this clearer. Let's place point L at (0, 0). Since LM is 4 units, point M would be at (4, 0). Now, since MQ is 1 unit, and assuming we're moving upwards, point Q would be at (4, 1). Then QP is another unit, so point P would be at (4, 2). Wait, but PO is another unit, so point O would be at (4, 3). But the rectangle is supposed to be 5 units tall, so point N should be at (0, 5). But if O is at (4, 3), then the height from M to O is only 3 units, which doesn't match the 5 units. I'm getting confused.Wait, maybe the rectangle is oriented differently. Maybe LM is 5 units, and the width is 4 units. Let me try that. So, point L is at (0, 0), M is at (0, 5), then MQ is 1 unit, so Q is at (1, 5). Then QP is another unit, so P is at (2, 5), and PO is another unit, so O is at (3, 5). But then the rectangle's width is 3 units, which doesn't match the 4 units given. Hmm, this isn't working.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is 4 units in length and 5 units in width, but the points are labeled differently. Maybe LM is 4 units along the length, and then MQ, QP, PO are along the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), M is at (4, 0). Then MQ is 1 unit upwards to Q at (4, 1), QP is another unit to P at (4, 2), and PO is another unit to O at (4, 3). But then the rectangle's width is only 3 units, which contradicts the 5 units. I'm stuck.Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me read the problem again: \\"Rectangle LMNO is a 4 √ó 5 rectangle with LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1.\\" So, LM is 1 unit, MQ is 1 unit, QP is 1 unit, and PO is 1 unit. So, LM + MQ + QP + PO = 4 units. That must mean that the side from L to O is 4 units, but the rectangle is 4x5, so maybe the sides are 4 and 5. So, if LM is 1 unit, then the side from L to M is 1 unit, and the side from M to O is 5 units? Wait, that might not make sense.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle has sides of 4 and 5, and the segments LM, MQ, QP, PO are each 1 unit, but they are along the perimeter. So, starting at L, moving 1 unit to M, then 1 unit to Q, then 1 unit to P, then 1 unit to O. So, the perimeter path from L to O is 4 units, but the rectangle's perimeter is 2*(4+5)=18 units. So, the shaded regions are formed by connecting Q to O and P to L. Hmm.Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates properly. Let's assume the rectangle is placed with L at (0, 0), M at (4, 0), N at (4, 5), and O at (0, 5). So, LM is 4 units, MN is 5 units, NO is 4 units, and OL is 5 units. But the problem says LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit to M, but LM is 4 units, so that doesn't fit. Maybe the points M, Q, P, O are along the side from L to O, which is 5 units. So, starting at L, moving 1 unit to M, another unit to Q, another to P, and another to O, making LO = 4 units, but the rectangle's side is 5 units. Hmm, conflicting again.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is divided into segments. Maybe LM is 1 unit along the length, MQ is 1 unit along the width, QP is 1 unit along the length, and PO is 1 unit along the width. So, starting at L, moving 1 unit right to M, then 1 unit up to Q, then 1 unit left to P, then 1 unit down to O. But then O would be at (3, 0), which doesn't make sense because O should be at (0, 5). I'm getting more confused.Maybe I need to look for another approach. The problem is about connecting Q to O and P to L, forming shaded regions. Maybe these lines intersect somewhere inside the rectangle, creating triangles or quadrilaterals whose areas we need to find. If I can find the coordinates of Q and P, I can find the equations of the lines QO and PL, find their intersection, and then calculate the areas.Let's try assigning coordinates again, carefully. Let me assume the rectangle is placed with L at (0, 0), M at (4, 0), N at (4, 5), and O at (0, 5). Now, LM is 4 units, but the problem says LM = 1. So, maybe the rectangle is scaled down? Wait, no, the rectangle is 4x5, so LM must be 4 units. But the problem says LM = 1. That's conflicting. Maybe the problem is that LM is 1 unit, and the rectangle is 4x5, so the sides are divided into segments of 1 unit each.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is divided into smaller segments. If LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1, then from L to M is 1, M to Q is 1, Q to P is 1, and P to O is 1. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit to M, then another unit to Q, another to P, and another to O. So, the total length from L to O is 4 units, but the rectangle's side LO is 5 units. So, there's a discrepancy of 1 unit. Maybe the points are not along the same side.Alternatively, perhaps the points M, Q, P are along different sides. For example, L is at (0, 0), M is at (1, 0), Q is at (1, 1), P is at (0, 1), and O is at (0, 2). But then the rectangle would be 1x2, not 4x5. Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe the rectangle is divided into smaller rectangles or squares. If LM = 1, MQ = 1, QP = 1, PO = 1, then perhaps the side LM is divided into four segments of 1 unit each, making the total length 4 units. So, L to M is 1, M to Q is 1, Q to P is 1, P to O is 1, totaling 4 units. So, the side from L to O is 4 units, but the rectangle is 4x5, so the other side is 5 units. So, points L, M, Q, P, O are along the length of 4 units, and the width is 5 units.So, assigning coordinates: L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (2, 0), P at (3, 0), O at (4, 0). But then the rectangle's height is 5 units, so point N would be at (4, 5). Now, connecting Q to O and P to L. So, Q is at (2, 0), O is at (4, 0). Wait, that's a straight line along the bottom side. Similarly, P is at (3, 0), L is at (0, 0). So, connecting P to L is also along the bottom side. That can't form any shaded regions because they're on the same line. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions.Wait, perhaps the points M, Q, P, O are not along the same side. Maybe M is on the length, Q is on the width, P is on the length, and O is on the width. Let me try that. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit along the length to M at (1, 0). Then from M, moving 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1). Then from Q, moving 1 unit left to P at (0, 1). Then from P, moving 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). Wait, that brings us back to L, which is not correct because O should be at (0, 5). Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe the points are along the perimeter. So, starting at L, moving 1 unit along the length to M, then 1 unit up to Q, then 1 unit left to P, then 1 unit down to O. But again, this would make O coincide with L, which is not the case. I'm really stuck here.Let me try a different approach. Maybe the rectangle is divided into smaller segments along both length and width. If LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1, perhaps they are along different sides. For example, LM is 1 unit along the length, MQ is 1 unit along the width, QP is 1 unit along the length, and PO is 1 unit along the width. So, starting at L, moving 1 unit right to M, then 1 unit up to Q, then 1 unit left to P, then 1 unit down to O. But then O would be at (0, 0), which is L. That can't be.Wait, maybe the points are labeled differently. Maybe L is at (0, 0), M is at (4, 0), Q is at (4, 1), P is at (3, 1), and O is at (0, 1). But then the rectangle's height is only 1 unit, which contradicts the 5 units. Hmm.I think I need to clarify the positions of points M, Q, P, O. The problem says LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1, and the rectangle is 4x5. So, perhaps LM is 1 unit along the length, MQ is 1 unit along the width, QP is 1 unit along the length, and PO is 1 unit along the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit right to M at (1, 0), then 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit left to P at (0, 1), then 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). But again, O coincides with L, which is not correct.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 4 units in length and 5 units in width, and the points M, Q, P, O are along the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit up to M at (0, 1), then 1 unit right to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit up to P at (1, 2), then 1 unit left to O at (0, 2). But then the rectangle's length is only 1 unit, which contradicts the 4 units. Hmm.I'm clearly not understanding the labeling correctly. Maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps the rectangle is divided into smaller segments along both length and width, with each segment being 1 unit. So, the length is divided into 4 units, and the width into 5 units. So, points M, Q, P, O are along these divisions.Wait, if LM = 1, MQ = 1, QP = 1, PO = 1, then starting from L, moving 1 unit to M, then another to Q, another to P, another to O. So, the total distance from L to O is 4 units. But the rectangle's side LO is 5 units. So, there's a 1 unit difference. Maybe O is not at the corner but somewhere else? That doesn't make sense because O is a corner of the rectangle.I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the rectangle is 4 units in one side and 5 units in the other, and the points M, Q, P, O divide one of the sides into four equal parts of 1 unit each. So, if the side is 4 units, then each segment is 1 unit. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit to M, another to Q, another to P, another to O, making LO = 4 units. But the rectangle is 4x5, so the other side is 5 units. So, points L, M, Q, P, O are along the 4-unit side, and the 5-unit side is from L to N.So, assigning coordinates: L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (2, 0), P at (3, 0), O at (4, 0). Then the rectangle goes up to N at (4, 5). Now, connecting Q to O and P to L. So, Q is at (2, 0), O is at (4, 0). Connecting them is a straight line along the bottom side. Similarly, P is at (3, 0), L is at (0, 0). Connecting them is also along the bottom side. So, no shaded regions are formed because both lines are on the same line. That can't be right.Wait, maybe the points are not all along the same side. Maybe M is on the length, Q is on the width, P is on the length, and O is on the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit right to M at (1, 0), then 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit left to P at (0, 1), then 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). But again, O coincides with L, which is not correct.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that the rectangle is divided into smaller squares or something. If it's a 4x5 rectangle, maybe it's divided into 1x1 squares, so there are 4 along the length and 5 along the width. So, points M, Q, P, O are at specific intersections. Let me try that.Assigning coordinates again: L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (1, 1), P at (0, 1), O at (0, 2). But then the rectangle's height is only 2 units, which contradicts the 5 units. Hmm.Wait, maybe the points are spread out along both length and width. So, LM is 1 unit along the length, MQ is 1 unit along the width, QP is 1 unit along the length, and PO is 1 unit along the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit right to M at (1, 0), then 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit left to P at (0, 1), then 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I'm missing something here. Maybe the points M, Q, P, O are not all on the perimeter but inside the rectangle. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit to M inside, then 1 unit to Q, then 1 unit to P, then 1 unit to O. But then the rectangle's dimensions are 4x5, so the positions would be somewhere inside. But without more information, it's hard to assign coordinates.Wait, maybe the rectangle is divided into a grid of 4x5 squares, each of size 1x1. So, there are 4 columns and 5 rows. Then points M, Q, P, O are at specific grid points. Let me try that.Assigning coordinates: L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (1, 1), P at (0, 1), O at (0, 2). But again, the rectangle's height is only 2 units, which contradicts the 5 units. Hmm.I think I need to approach this differently. Maybe the problem is about similar triangles or something. If I connect Q to O and P to L, these lines will intersect somewhere inside the rectangle, forming triangles whose areas I can calculate.Let me assume that the rectangle is 4 units wide (length) and 5 units tall (width). So, L at (0, 0), M at (4, 0), N at (4, 5), O at (0, 5). Now, LM = 4 units, but the problem says LM = 1. So, maybe the points M, Q, P, O divide the sides into segments of 1 unit each.Wait, if LM = 1, then M is at (1, 0). Then MQ = 1, so Q is at (1, 1). Then QP = 1, so P is at (0, 1). Then PO = 1, so O is at (0, 2). But then the rectangle's height is only 2 units, which contradicts the 5 units. Hmm.Wait, maybe the points are along the perimeter. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit along the length to M, then 1 unit up along the width to Q, then 1 unit left along the length to P, then 1 unit down along the width to O. So, L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (1, 1), P at (0, 1), O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps the rectangle is divided into smaller segments, and the points M, Q, P, O are at specific intervals. If LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1, then the total distance from L to O is 4 units. But the rectangle's side is 5 units, so there's a 1 unit difference. Maybe O is not at the corner but somewhere else. But that doesn't make sense because O is a corner.Wait, maybe the rectangle is divided into 4 equal parts along one side, each 1 unit, and 5 units along the other. So, points M, Q, P, O are along the 4-unit side, each 1 unit apart. So, L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (2, 0), P at (3, 0), O at (4, 0). Then the rectangle goes up to N at (4, 5). Now, connecting Q to O and P to L. So, Q is at (2, 0), O is at (4, 0). Connecting them is a straight line along the bottom side. Similarly, P is at (3, 0), L is at (0, 0). Connecting them is also along the bottom side. So, no shaded regions are formed because both lines are on the same line. That can't be right.Wait, maybe the points are not all on the same side. Maybe M is on the length, Q is on the width, P is on the length, and O is on the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit right to M at (1, 0), then 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit left to P at (0, 1), then 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is about the intersection of lines QO and PL, and the shaded areas are the triangles formed by these intersections. If I can find the coordinates of Q and P, I can find the equations of the lines QO and PL, find their intersection, and then calculate the areas of the triangles.Let me try assigning coordinates again, carefully. Let's assume the rectangle is placed with L at (0, 0), M at (4, 0), N at (4, 5), and O at (0, 5). Now, LM is 4 units, but the problem says LM = 1. So, maybe the points M, Q, P, O are along the side from L to O, which is 5 units. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit to M, another unit to Q, another to P, and another to O, making LO = 4 units, but the rectangle's side is 5 units. So, there's a 1 unit difference. Maybe the points are not starting from L but somewhere else.Wait, maybe the points are along the perimeter, starting from L, moving 1 unit along the length to M, then 1 unit up along the width to Q, then 1 unit left along the length to P, then 1 unit down along the width to O. So, L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (1, 1), P at (0, 1), O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I need to consider that the rectangle is divided into smaller segments, and the points M, Q, P, O are at specific intervals. If LM = MQ = QP = PO = 1, then the total distance from L to O is 4 units. But the rectangle's side is 5 units, so there's a 1 unit difference. Maybe O is not at the corner but somewhere else. But that doesn't make sense because O is a corner.Wait, maybe the points are along the diagonal. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit along the diagonal to M, then another unit to Q, another to P, another to O. But the diagonal of a 4x5 rectangle is ‚àö(4¬≤ + 5¬≤) = ‚àö41 ‚âà 6.4 units, so dividing it into 4 segments of 1 unit each would make sense. So, points M, Q, P, O are along the diagonal from L to O, each 1 unit apart. So, L at (0, 0), M at (4/‚àö41, 5/‚àö41), Q at (8/‚àö41, 10/‚àö41), P at (12/‚àö41, 15/‚àö41), O at (16/‚àö41, 20/‚àö41). But 16/‚àö41 is approximately 2.5, which is less than 4, so O is not at (4, 5). Hmm, not helpful.I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simpler. If I can't figure out the exact positions, maybe I can use ratios or similar triangles to find the areas.Wait, let's assume that the rectangle is 4 units wide and 5 units tall. Points M, Q, P, O are along the width, each 1 unit apart. So, starting from L at (0, 0), M at (0, 1), Q at (0, 2), P at (0, 3), O at (0, 4). But then the rectangle's height is 5 units, so there's 1 unit left. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the points are along the length. So, L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (2, 0), P at (3, 0), O at (4, 0). Then the rectangle goes up to N at (4, 5). Now, connecting Q to O and P to L. So, Q is at (2, 0), O is at (4, 0). Connecting them is a straight line along the bottom side. Similarly, P is at (3, 0), L is at (0, 0). Connecting them is also along the bottom side. So, no shaded regions are formed because both lines are on the same line. That can't be right.Wait, maybe the points are not all on the same side. Maybe M is on the length, Q is on the width, P is on the length, and O is on the width. So, starting from L at (0, 0), moving 1 unit right to M at (1, 0), then 1 unit up to Q at (1, 1), then 1 unit left to P at (0, 1), then 1 unit down to O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I need to give up and look for another way. Maybe the area is simply half of the rectangle, which is 10, but the options are much smaller. Alternatively, maybe the shaded areas are triangles with base 1 and height 1, so area 0.5 each, totaling 1. But that's not an option.Wait, maybe the lines QO and PL intersect inside the rectangle, forming triangles. If I can find the coordinates of Q and P, I can find the equations of the lines and their intersection point, then calculate the areas.Let me assume that the rectangle is 4 units wide and 5 units tall. Let's assign coordinates: L at (0, 0), M at (4, 0), N at (4, 5), O at (0, 5). Now, LM = 4 units, but the problem says LM = 1. So, maybe the points M, Q, P, O are along the side from L to O, which is 5 units. So, starting from L, moving 1 unit to M, another unit to Q, another to P, and another to O, making LO = 4 units, but the rectangle's side is 5 units. So, there's a 1 unit difference. Maybe the points are not starting from L but somewhere else.Wait, maybe the points are along the perimeter, starting from L, moving 1 unit along the length to M, then 1 unit up along the width to Q, then 1 unit left along the length to P, then 1 unit down along the width to O. So, L at (0, 0), M at (1, 0), Q at (1, 1), P at (0, 1), O at (0, 0). Again, O coincides with L. Not helpful.I think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is 3.5, which is option B. I'll go with that."},{"question":"Let theta be an acute angle, and let[cos frac{theta}{4} = sqrt{frac{x + 2}{3x}}.]Express sin theta in terms of x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express sin Œ∏ in terms of x, given that cos(Œ∏/4) is equal to the square root of (x + 2)/(3x). Hmm, let me see. I remember that when dealing with trigonometric functions and angles, sometimes using double-angle or half-angle identities can help. Since Œ∏ is an acute angle, that means Œ∏ is between 0 and 90 degrees, so Œ∏/4 would be between 0 and 22.5 degrees. That's good because all the trigonometric functions for these angles will be positive, which might simplify things.First, the given equation is cos(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)]. I think I can square both sides to get rid of the square root. Let me do that:cos¬≤(Œ∏/4) = (x + 2)/(3x)Okay, now I know that sin¬≤(Œ∏/4) can be found using the Pythagorean identity, which is sin¬≤œÜ + cos¬≤œÜ = 1. So, sin¬≤(Œ∏/4) = 1 - cos¬≤(Œ∏/4). Plugging in the value we just found:sin¬≤(Œ∏/4) = 1 - (x + 2)/(3x) = (3x - (x + 2))/(3x) = (2x - 2)/(3x) = 2(x - 1)/(3x)So, sin(Œ∏/4) is the square root of that, right? So,sin(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)]Alright, now I need to find sin Œ∏. I remember that sin Œ∏ can be expressed using double-angle identities. Since Œ∏ is four times Œ∏/4, maybe I can use the double-angle formula twice. Let me recall the double-angle formula for sine: sin(2œÜ) = 2 sin œÜ cos œÜ.So, first, let me find sin(Œ∏/2). Since Œ∏/2 is twice Œ∏/4, I can use the double-angle formula:sin(Œ∏/2) = 2 sin(Œ∏/4) cos(Œ∏/4)We already have expressions for both sin(Œ∏/4) and cos(Œ∏/4):sin(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)]cos(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)]Multiplying them together:sin(Œ∏/2) = 2 * sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)] * sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)]Let me simplify this. Multiplying the square roots:sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)] * sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)] = sqrt{ [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) }So, sin(Œ∏/2) = 2 * sqrt{ [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) }Simplify the constants:2 * sqrt{ [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) } = 2 * sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} / (3x)So, sin(Œ∏/2) = (2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (3x)Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but okay. Now, I need to find sin Œ∏. Since Œ∏ is twice Œ∏/2, I can use the double-angle formula again:sin Œ∏ = 2 sin(Œ∏/2) cos(Œ∏/2)I already have sin(Œ∏/2), so I need to find cos(Œ∏/2). Again, using the Pythagorean identity:cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = 1 - sin¬≤(Œ∏/2)We have sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) from earlier:sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)So,cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = 1 - [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)Let me compute that:First, expand the numerator:2(x - 1)(x + 2) = 2(x¬≤ + 2x - x - 2) = 2(x¬≤ + x - 2) = 2x¬≤ + 2x - 4So,cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = 1 - (2x¬≤ + 2x - 4)/(9x¬≤) = (9x¬≤ - 2x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(9x¬≤) = (7x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(9x¬≤)Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again.Wait, 1 is equal to 9x¬≤/9x¬≤, so:cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = (9x¬≤ - 2x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(9x¬≤) = (7x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(9x¬≤)Hmm, okay, so cos(Œ∏/2) is sqrt[(7x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(9x¬≤)] = sqrt(7x¬≤ - 2x + 4)/(3x)But wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me double-check the earlier steps.Wait, when I calculated sin¬≤(Œ∏/2), I had:sin(Œ∏/2) = (2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (3x)So, sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [4 * 2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) = [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.When I squared sin(Œ∏/2), I should square the entire expression:sin(Œ∏/2) = (2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (3x)So, sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [4 * 2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) = [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)Yes, that's correct. So, earlier, I incorrectly wrote sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) as [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤), but actually it's 8 times that. So, my mistake was in the previous step.So, correcting that:sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)Therefore, cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = 1 - [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)Compute the numerator:1 = 9x¬≤/9x¬≤So,cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [9x¬≤ - 8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤)First, expand 8(x - 1)(x + 2):8(x - 1)(x + 2) = 8(x¬≤ + 2x - x - 2) = 8(x¬≤ + x - 2) = 8x¬≤ + 8x - 16So,cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [9x¬≤ - (8x¬≤ + 8x - 16)] / (9x¬≤) = [9x¬≤ - 8x¬≤ - 8x + 16] / (9x¬≤) = [x¬≤ - 8x + 16] / (9x¬≤)Ah, that's better. So, cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = (x¬≤ - 8x + 16)/(9x¬≤)Therefore, cos(Œ∏/2) = sqrt[(x¬≤ - 8x + 16)/(9x¬≤)] = sqrt(x¬≤ - 8x + 16)/(3x)Wait, x¬≤ - 8x + 16 is a perfect square, right? It factors as (x - 4)¬≤.So, cos(Œ∏/2) = (x - 4)/(3x)But wait, since Œ∏ is acute, Œ∏/2 is between 0 and 45 degrees, so cos(Œ∏/2) should be positive. So, we can write it as (x - 4)/(3x), but we need to ensure that x - 4 is positive. Hmm, that might depend on the value of x. But since Œ∏ is acute, and we have cos(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)], the argument inside the square root must be positive, so (x + 2)/(3x) > 0. Since Œ∏ is acute, Œ∏/4 is less than 22.5 degrees, so cos(Œ∏/4) is positive, which it is because it's a square root. So, (x + 2)/(3x) > 0 implies that x + 2 and 3x have the same sign. Since 3x is positive if x > 0, so x + 2 must also be positive, so x > -2. But since we're dealing with square roots, x must be positive because 3x is in the denominator, so x > 0. Therefore, x is positive, so x - 4 could be positive or negative. But since cos(Œ∏/2) is positive, as Œ∏/2 is acute, so (x - 4)/(3x) must be positive. Therefore, x - 4 > 0, so x > 4.So, x must be greater than 4. That's an important condition.So, cos(Œ∏/2) = (x - 4)/(3x)Okay, now going back to sin Œ∏:sin Œ∏ = 2 sin(Œ∏/2) cos(Œ∏/2)We have sin(Œ∏/2) = (2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (3x)And cos(Œ∏/2) = (x - 4)/(3x)So, plugging these into the formula:sin Œ∏ = 2 * [2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} / (3x)] * [(x - 4)/(3x)]Simplify step by step.First, multiply the constants:2 * 2 = 4Then, the denominators: 3x * 3x = 9x¬≤So, sin Œ∏ = [4 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} * (x - 4)] / (9x¬≤)We can write this as:sin Œ∏ = [4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}] / (9x¬≤)Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify it further. Let me see if the expression inside the square root can be simplified or factored.Looking at 2(x - 1)(x + 2):2(x - 1)(x + 2) = 2(x¬≤ + 2x - x - 2) = 2(x¬≤ + x - 2) = 2x¬≤ + 2x - 4So, sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} = sqrt(2x¬≤ + 2x - 4)So, sin Œ∏ = [4 (x - 4) sqrt(2x¬≤ + 2x - 4)] / (9x¬≤)Alternatively, we can factor out a 2 from the square root:sqrt(2x¬≤ + 2x - 4) = sqrt{2(x¬≤ + x - 2)} = sqrt{2(x + 2)(x - 1)}Wait, that's the same as before. So, maybe it's better to leave it as sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}.Alternatively, we can write the entire expression as:sin Œ∏ = [4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}] / (9x¬≤)I think that's as simplified as it gets. Let me just check if I can factor anything else or if there's a better way to write it.Alternatively, we can write it as:sin Œ∏ = [4 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} (x - 4)] / (9x¬≤)But I don't think that's any simpler. So, I think this is the expression for sin Œ∏ in terms of x.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Started with cos(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)].2. Squared both sides to get cos¬≤(Œ∏/4) = (x + 2)/(3x).3. Found sin¬≤(Œ∏/4) = 1 - (x + 2)/(3x) = (2x - 2)/(3x) = 2(x - 1)/(3x).4. Took square root to get sin(Œ∏/4) = sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)].5. Then, used double-angle formula for sin(Œ∏/2) = 2 sin(Œ∏/4) cos(Œ∏/4) = 2 * sqrt[2(x - 1)/(3x)] * sqrt[(x + 2)/(3x)] = 2 * sqrt{ [2(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) } = (2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (3x).6. Then, found sin¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤).7. Then, cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = 1 - [8(x - 1)(x + 2)] / (9x¬≤) = [9x¬≤ - 8(x¬≤ + x - 2)] / (9x¬≤) = [9x¬≤ - 8x¬≤ - 8x + 16] / (9x¬≤) = [x¬≤ - 8x + 16] / (9x¬≤) = (x - 4)¬≤ / (9x¬≤).8. So, cos(Œ∏/2) = (x - 4)/(3x), considering x > 4.9. Then, sin Œ∏ = 2 sin(Œ∏/2) cos(Œ∏/2) = 2 * [2 sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)} / (3x)] * [(x - 4)/(3x)] = [4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}] / (9x¬≤).Yes, that seems correct. So, the final expression for sin Œ∏ in terms of x is [4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}] / (9x¬≤).Alternatively, we can write it as:sin Œ∏ = (4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}) / (9x¬≤)I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there are no algebraic errors.Wait, when I computed cos¬≤(Œ∏/2), I had:cos¬≤(Œ∏/2) = [x¬≤ - 8x + 16]/(9x¬≤) = (x - 4)¬≤/(9x¬≤)Yes, that's correct because (x - 4)¬≤ = x¬≤ - 8x + 16.So, cos(Œ∏/2) = (x - 4)/(3x), which is positive since x > 4.Therefore, all steps seem correct. So, the final expression is:sin Œ∏ = [4 (x - 4) sqrt{2(x - 1)(x + 2)}] / (9x¬≤)I think that's the answer."},{"question":"One ball will drop from a certain height.

This can be expressed as:[text{Total travel} = 90 + 2(90P) + 2(90P^2)]Given that the total travel is 225 cm, we set up the equation:[225 = 90 + 180P + 180P^2]Simplifying the equation:[180P^2 + 180P - 135 = 0]Dividing the entire equation by 45 to simplify further:[4P^2 + 4P - 3 = 0]Now, solving for ( P ) using the quadratic formula:[P = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Where ( a = 4 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = -3 ):[P = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 48}}{8} = frac{-4 pm 8}{8}]This gives two possible solutions:[P = frac{4}{8} = 0.5 quad text{or} quad P = frac{-12}{8} = -1.5]Since a percentage cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

I need to show that this limit converges. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that when dealing with integrals that go to infinity, one common method to check for convergence is to use integration by parts. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me recall the integration by parts formula: ( int u , dv = uv - int v , du ). So, I need to choose ( u ) and ( dv ) from the integrand ( sin(x) sin(x^2) ).Let me set ( u = sin(x) ) and ( dv = sin(x^2) , dx ). Then, I need to find ( du ) and ( v ). The derivative of ( sin(x) ) is ( cos(x) ), so ( du = cos(x) , dx ). Now, ( v ) is the integral of ( sin(x^2) , dx ). Hmm, integrating ( sin(x^2) ) isn't straightforward. I remember that the integral of ( sin(x^2) ) is related to the Fresnel integral, which doesn't have an elementary form. Maybe I need to find another way.Wait, perhaps instead of integrating by parts right away, I can use a substitution to simplify the integrand. Let me see. The integrand is ( sin(x) sin(x^2) ). Maybe I can use a trigonometric identity to combine these terms. I recall that ( sin(a)sin(b) = frac{1}{2}[cos(a - b) - cos(a + b)] ). Let me apply that here.So, ( sin(x) sin(x^2) = frac{1}{2}[cos(x - x^2) - cos(x + x^2)] ). That simplifies the integrand to ( frac{1}{2}[cos(x - x^2) - cos(x + x^2)] ). Now, the integral becomes:[frac{1}{2} int_0^k [cos(x - x^2) - cos(x + x^2)] , dx]Hmm, that might be easier to handle. Let me split this into two separate integrals:[frac{1}{2} left( int_0^k cos(x - x^2) , dx - int_0^k cos(x + x^2) , dx right)]Now, I need to evaluate each of these integrals separately and see if they converge as ( k ) approaches infinity.Let me consider the first integral: ( int_0^k cos(x - x^2) , dx ). Let me make a substitution here. Let ( u = x^2 - x ). Then, ( du = 2x - 1 , dx ). Hmm, that doesn't seem to directly help because the differential doesn't match up. Maybe another substitution?Alternatively, perhaps I can write ( x - x^2 = -(x^2 - x) = -left(x^2 - x + frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4}right) = -left( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) = -left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{4} ). So, ( x - x^2 = frac{1}{4} - left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 ). Therefore, ( cos(x - x^2) = cosleft( frac{1}{4} - left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 right) ).Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can use another approach. Let me consider the integral ( int cos(x - x^2) , dx ). Let me make a substitution ( t = x^2 - x ). Then, ( dt = (2x - 1) , dx ). Hmm, again, not directly helpful because the integral doesn't have a ( (2x - 1) ) term.Wait, maybe I can express ( cos(x - x^2) ) as ( cosleft( -left(x^2 - x right) right) = cosleft( x^2 - x right) ) since cosine is an even function. So, ( cos(x - x^2) = cos(x^2 - x) ). Maybe that helps with substitution.Let me try substitution ( u = x^2 - x ). Then, ( du = (2x - 1) , dx ). Hmm, still not directly matching. Maybe I can manipulate the integral to include ( du ). Let me see:If ( du = (2x - 1) , dx ), then I can write ( dx = frac{du}{2x - 1} ). But I still have ( x ) in terms of ( u ), which complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the integral ( int cos(x^2 - x) , dx ) and see if it's related to Fresnel integrals or something similar. I know that ( int cos(x^2) , dx ) is a Fresnel integral, which converges as ( x ) approaches infinity. Maybe there's a way to relate ( cos(x^2 - x) ) to ( cos(x^2) ) or similar functions.Wait, another idea: maybe I can complete the square in the argument of the cosine function. Let me try that.For ( x^2 - x ), completing the square:[x^2 - x = left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4}]So, ( cos(x^2 - x) = cosleft( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) ). Using the cosine of a difference identity:[cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B]So,[cosleft( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) = cosleft( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 right) cosleft( frac{1}{4} right) + sinleft( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 right) sinleft( frac{1}{4} right)]Hmm, that might not necessarily help, but it's an interesting representation. Maybe I can express the integral in terms of these functions.Alternatively, perhaps I can use a substitution ( t = x - frac{1}{2} ). Then, ( x = t + frac{1}{2} ), and ( dx = dt ). Let's see how the integral transforms.So, ( int cosleft( left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) , dx = int cosleft( t^2 - frac{1}{4} right) , dt ). Again, using the cosine of a difference identity:[cos(t^2 - frac{1}{4}) = cos(t^2) cos(frac{1}{4}) + sin(t^2) sin(frac{1}{4})]So, the integral becomes:[cosleft( frac{1}{4} right) int cos(t^2) , dt + sinleft( frac{1}{4} right) int sin(t^2) , dt]Ah, now these integrals are Fresnel integrals! I know that ( int cos(t^2) , dt ) and ( int sin(t^2) , dt ) converge as ( t ) approaches infinity. Specifically, their limits are known and finite. So, this suggests that the integral ( int cos(x^2 - x) , dx ) converges as ( x ) approaches infinity.Similarly, for the second integral ( int_0^k cos(x + x^2) , dx ), I can apply a similar substitution. Let me try completing the square here as well.( x + x^2 = x^2 + x = left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} ). So,[cos(x + x^2) = cosleft( left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right)]Again, using the cosine of a difference identity:[cosleft( left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} right) = cosleft( left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 right) cosleft( frac{1}{4} right) + sinleft( left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 right) sinleft( frac{1}{4} right)]Then, substituting ( t = x + frac{1}{2} ), ( x = t - frac{1}{2} ), ( dx = dt ), the integral becomes:[cosleft( frac{1}{4} right) int cos(t^2) , dt + sinleft( frac{1}{4} right) int sin(t^2) , dt]Again, these are Fresnel integrals, which converge as ( t ) approaches infinity.So, both integrals ( int_0^k cos(x - x^2) , dx ) and ( int_0^k cos(x + x^2) , dx ) converge as ( k ) approaches infinity. Therefore, their difference also converges, and hence the original integral ( int_0^k sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx ) converges as ( k ) approaches infinity.Wait, but I should probably check if the constants and coefficients affect the convergence. Let me recap:The original integral was split into two parts, each involving Fresnel integrals multiplied by constants ( cosleft( frac{1}{4} right) ) and ( sinleft( frac{1}{4} right) ). Since these constants are finite and the Fresnel integrals converge, their linear combination also converges. Therefore, the entire expression converges.Alternatively, another approach could be to use the Dirichlet test for integrals. The Dirichlet test states that if ( f(x) ) is decreasing and tends to zero as ( x ) approaches infinity, and ( g(x) ) has bounded integral over any interval, then ( int f(x)g(x) , dx ) converges.In our case, if we can write the integrand as a product of such functions, we might apply the Dirichlet test. Let me see.Looking back at the integrand ( sin(x) sin(x^2) ), perhaps I can write it as ( sin(x) cdot sin(x^2) ). If I consider ( f(x) = sin(x) ) and ( g(x) = sin(x^2) ), but ( f(x) ) is not necessarily decreasing or tending to zero. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate it differently.Wait, another idea: using substitution to express the integral in terms of a function that oscillates and decays. Let me try substitution ( t = x^2 ). Then, ( dt = 2x , dx ), so ( dx = frac{dt}{2sqrt{t}} ). Let's see how the integral transforms.So, ( int sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx = int sin(sqrt{t}) sin(t) cdot frac{dt}{2sqrt{t}} ). Hmm, that gives:[frac{1}{2} int frac{sin(sqrt{t}) sin(t)}{sqrt{t}} , dt]Not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can use another trigonometric identity here. Recall that ( sin(a)sin(b) = frac{1}{2}[cos(a - b) - cos(a + b)] ). Applying that:[frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} int frac{cos(sqrt{t} - t) - cos(sqrt{t} + t)}{sqrt{t}} , dt = frac{1}{4} int frac{cos(sqrt{t} - t) - cos(sqrt{t} + t)}{sqrt{t}} , dt]Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another substitution? Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the integral ( int sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx ) and see if it can be expressed as an integral of a function that oscillates and whose amplitude decays. If I can show that the integral is bounded and the oscillations lead to cancellation, then the integral might converge.Wait, another approach: integrating by parts. Let me try that again, but this time, maybe choosing different ( u ) and ( dv ). Let me set ( u = sin(x^2) ) and ( dv = sin(x) , dx ). Then, ( du = 2x cos(x^2) , dx ) and ( v = -cos(x) ).Applying integration by parts:[int sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx = -sin(x^2) cos(x) + int 2x cos(x^2) cos(x) , dx]Hmm, now I have a new integral ( int 2x cos(x^2) cos(x) , dx ). Let me see if I can handle this.Again, perhaps using a substitution. Let me set ( t = x^2 ), so ( dt = 2x , dx ). Then, the integral becomes:[int cos(t) cos(sqrt{t}) , dt]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can use another trigonometric identity on ( cos(x^2) cos(x) ). Recall that ( cos(a)cos(b) = frac{1}{2}[cos(a - b) + cos(a + b)] ). Applying that:[cos(x^2) cos(x) = frac{1}{2}[cos(x^2 - x) + cos(x^2 + x)]]So, the integral becomes:[int 2x cdot frac{1}{2}[cos(x^2 - x) + cos(x^2 + x)] , dx = int x [cos(x^2 - x) + cos(x^2 + x)] , dx]Hmm, not sure if that's helpful either. Maybe I need to consider integrating by parts again or find another substitution.Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution for each term separately. Let's consider ( int x cos(x^2 - x) , dx ) and ( int x cos(x^2 + x) , dx ).For the first integral, let me set ( u = x^2 - x ). Then, ( du = (2x - 1) , dx ). Hmm, but I have ( x cos(u) , dx ). Maybe I can express ( x ) in terms of ( u ). Not straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps I can write ( x = frac{u + x}{2} ) or something like that. Not sure.Wait, another idea: maybe I can express ( x ) as ( frac{du + dx}{2} ) or something. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider integrating by parts again. Let me set ( u = x ) and ( dv = cos(x^2 - x) , dx ). Then, ( du = dx ) and ( v = int cos(x^2 - x) , dx ). But I don't know what ( v ) is explicitly, so that might not help.Hmm, this seems to be getting complicated. Maybe I should go back to the original approach where I expressed the integrand as a difference of cosines and related it to Fresnel integrals. Since Fresnel integrals are known to converge, that might be a more straightforward path.So, recalling that:[int_0^k sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx = frac{1}{2} left( int_0^k cos(x - x^2) , dx - int_0^k cos(x + x^2) , dx right)]And both integrals on the right-hand side can be transformed into Fresnel integrals, which are known to converge as ( k ) approaches infinity. Therefore, the original integral converges.Alternatively, another way to see this is to consider the integral ( int sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx ) and note that it can be expressed as a combination of functions whose integrals are known to converge. Since both ( cos(x^2 - x) ) and ( cos(x^2 + x) ) lead to Fresnel-type integrals, and those converge, the original integral must also converge.I think I've convinced myself that the integral converges by relating it to Fresnel integrals, which are known to converge. So, the limit as ( k ) approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to ( k ) of ( sin(x) sin(x^2) , dx ) does indeed converge."},{"question":"Let ( S = S_0 ) be a set of points in space. For ( n geq 1 ), define ( S_n ) as the set of points ( P ) such that ( P ) belongs to the closed segment ( AB ) for some ( A, B in S_{n-1} ). Show that ( S_2 = S_3 ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a set of points S‚ÇÄ in space. Then, for each n ‚â• 1, S‚Çô is defined as the set of all points P such that P lies on the closed segment AB for some points A and B in S‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ. I need to show that S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.First, let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly. S‚ÇÄ is just the initial set of points. Then, S‚ÇÅ consists of all points that lie on any segment connecting two points from S‚ÇÄ. Similarly, S‚ÇÇ consists of all points that lie on any segment connecting two points from S‚ÇÅ, and S‚ÇÉ is defined the same way from S‚ÇÇ. So, each subsequent S‚Çô is built by taking all possible segments between points in the previous S‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ.Now, the goal is to show that S‚ÇÇ is equal to S‚ÇÉ. That means that once we get to S‚ÇÇ, adding another step to form S‚ÇÉ doesn't introduce any new points. So, S‚ÇÇ must already contain all the points that would be in S‚ÇÉ. Intuitively, this suggests that S‚ÇÇ is somehow \\"complete\\" in the sense that it already includes all possible points that can be formed by connecting points in S‚ÇÅ, and hence, S‚ÇÉ doesn't add anything new.I think this has something to do with the concept of convex hulls. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set containing all the points. A convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the entire segment connecting them is also in the set. So, if S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull of S‚ÇÄ, then S‚ÇÉ, which is built from S‚ÇÇ, would just be the same as S‚ÇÇ because the convex hull is already closed under taking segments.But wait, is S‚ÇÇ necessarily the convex hull of S‚ÇÄ? Let me think. S‚ÇÅ is all the points on segments between points in S‚ÇÄ, which is like taking all the edges of the convex hull. Then S‚ÇÇ is all the points on segments between points in S‚ÇÅ, which would include all the points inside the convex hull. So, S‚ÇÇ should indeed be the convex hull of S‚ÇÄ. If that's the case, then S‚ÇÉ, which is built from S‚ÇÇ, would just be the same as S‚ÇÇ because the convex hull is already complete.But maybe I should be more precise. Let me try to formalize this. Suppose we have points A and B in S‚ÇÇ. Since S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull, any point on the segment AB is already in S‚ÇÇ. Therefore, S‚ÇÉ, which is the set of all such points, would just be S‚ÇÇ. So, S‚ÇÉ is a subset of S‚ÇÇ. But since S‚ÇÇ is built from S‚ÇÅ, and S‚ÇÅ is built from S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÇ must contain all points that can be formed by segments of segments, which is exactly what S‚ÇÉ is. Therefore, S‚ÇÇ is a subset of S‚ÇÉ as well. Hence, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ.Wait, but is there a possibility that S‚ÇÇ might not be the convex hull? Maybe if the original set S‚ÇÄ has some special properties? Hmm, no, I think regardless of the configuration of S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÇ should always be the convex hull. Because S‚ÇÅ gives all the edges, and S‚ÇÇ fills in all the interior points by connecting those edges. So, S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull, and S‚ÇÉ can't add anything beyond that.Let me think of a simple example. Suppose S‚ÇÄ is three non-collinear points forming a triangle. Then S‚ÇÅ would be all the points on the edges of the triangle. S‚ÇÇ would then be all the points inside the triangle, making it the convex hull. S‚ÇÉ would be all the points on segments between points in S‚ÇÇ, but since S‚ÇÇ is already the entire triangle, S‚ÇÉ would just be the same as S‚ÇÇ. So, in this case, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ.Another example: suppose S‚ÇÄ is four points forming a tetrahedron. Then S‚ÇÅ would be all the edges, S‚ÇÇ would be all the faces, and S‚ÇÉ would be the entire volume of the tetrahedron. But wait, in three dimensions, the convex hull of four points is the tetrahedron, so S‚ÇÇ would already be the entire tetrahedron, right? Because connecting all the edges (S‚ÇÅ) and then connecting points on the edges (S‚ÇÇ) would fill in the faces and the interior. So, S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull, and S‚ÇÉ doesn't add anything new.Hmm, so in both two and three dimensions, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ because S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull. Therefore, in general, S‚ÇÇ should equal S‚ÇÉ for any initial set S‚ÇÄ in space.But maybe I should consider a case where S‚ÇÄ is not in general position. For example, suppose S‚ÇÄ is colinear. Then S‚ÇÅ would just be the line segment between the two farthest points, and S‚ÇÇ would be the same as S‚ÇÅ because any segment between points on the line is just the line itself. So, in this case, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÅ, and S‚ÇÉ would also equal S‚ÇÇ. So, the equality still holds.Wait, but in this case, S‚ÇÇ is equal to S‚ÇÅ, which is already the convex hull. So, regardless of whether S‚ÇÄ is colinear or not, S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull, and S‚ÇÉ doesn't add anything.I think I'm getting convinced that S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ because S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull, and the convex hull is closed under taking segments, so S‚ÇÉ can't add anything beyond that.But maybe I should try to formalize this with induction or some kind of step-by-step argument.Let me try to outline the proof:1. Show that S‚ÇÅ is the set of all points on the segments between points in S‚ÇÄ.2. Show that S‚ÇÇ is the set of all points that can be expressed as convex combinations of points in S‚ÇÄ, i.e., the convex hull of S‚ÇÄ.3. Since the convex hull is closed under taking segments, S‚ÇÉ, which is built from S‚ÇÇ, cannot introduce any new points beyond those already in S‚ÇÇ.4. Therefore, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ.But perhaps I need to be more precise in showing that S‚ÇÇ is indeed the convex hull.Let me recall that the convex hull of a set S is the smallest convex set containing S. A convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the entire segment connecting them is also in the set.So, if I can show that S‚ÇÇ is convex and contains S‚ÇÄ, and that any convex set containing S‚ÇÄ must contain S‚ÇÇ, then S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull.First, S‚ÇÇ contains S‚ÇÅ, which contains S‚ÇÄ, so S‚ÇÇ contains S‚ÇÄ.Next, is S‚ÇÇ convex? Let's see. Take any two points P and Q in S‚ÇÇ. By definition of S‚ÇÇ, P and Q lie on some segments between points in S‚ÇÅ. But since S‚ÇÅ is the set of segments between points in S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÇ is built from segments of segments, which should cover all convex combinations.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of convex combinations. A point in S‚ÇÇ can be written as a convex combination of points in S‚ÇÅ, which themselves are convex combinations of points in S‚ÇÄ. So, a point in S‚ÇÇ is a convex combination of convex combinations, which is still a convex combination. Therefore, S‚ÇÇ is the set of all convex combinations of points in S‚ÇÄ, which is exactly the convex hull.Therefore, S‚ÇÇ is the convex hull of S‚ÇÄ, which is a convex set. Hence, any segment between two points in S‚ÇÇ is entirely contained in S‚ÇÇ. Therefore, S‚ÇÉ, which is the set of all such segments, is just S‚ÇÇ. Hence, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ.I think that makes sense. So, to summarize:- S‚ÇÅ is the set of all segments between points in S‚ÇÄ.- S‚ÇÇ is the set of all segments between points in S‚ÇÅ, which fills in the convex hull.- Since the convex hull is convex, S‚ÇÉ, which is built from S‚ÇÇ, doesn't add any new points.Therefore, S‚ÇÇ equals S‚ÇÉ.I think that's the gist of it. Maybe I should write it out more formally, but the intuition is there."},{"question":"Determine all positive integer solutions of the equationoperatorname{kgV}(a, b, c) = a + b + c","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all positive integer solutions for the equation where the least common multiple (LCM) of three numbers a, b, and c equals the sum of those numbers. That is, LCM(a, b, c) = a + b + c. Hmm, interesting. I remember that LCM is the smallest number that all of a, b, and c divide into. So, I need to find triples (a, b, c) such that when I add them up, I get their LCM.First, maybe I should start by assuming some order for a, b, and c to make things easier. Let's say a ‚â§ b ‚â§ c. That way, I can have some structure to work with. So, a is the smallest, then b, then c. Since they are positive integers, a is at least 1.Now, since a ‚â§ b ‚â§ c, the LCM of a, b, and c must be at least as big as c because c is the largest number. So, LCM(a, b, c) ‚â• c. But in our equation, LCM(a, b, c) = a + b + c. So, that means a + b + c must be at least c, which is obviously true because a and b are positive. But more importantly, the LCM can't be too much larger than c, because a + b + c is just the sum of the three numbers.Let me think about the relationship between LCM and the numbers themselves. If all three numbers are the same, say a = b = c, then LCM(a, a, a) = a, and the sum would be 3a. So, setting a = 3a would imply a = 0, which isn't a positive integer. So, that case doesn't work.What if two of them are equal? Let's say a = b < c. Then, LCM(a, a, c) would be LCM(a, c). So, the equation becomes LCM(a, c) = a + a + c = 2a + c. Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Maybe I can explore this case.Let me denote d = GCD(a, c). Then, LCM(a, c) = (a * c) / d. So, substituting into the equation, (a * c) / d = 2a + c. Let me rearrange this: (a * c) / d - c = 2a. Factor out c: c(a/d - 1) = 2a. So, c = (2a) / (a/d - 1).Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should try specific values for a and see if I can find c.Let's try a = 1. Then, LCM(1, 1, c) = c. The equation becomes c = 1 + 1 + c, which simplifies to c = c + 2. That's impossible. So, a can't be 1 in this case.Next, a = 2. Then, LCM(2, 2, c) = LCM(2, c). The equation becomes LCM(2, c) = 2 + 2 + c = 4 + c. So, LCM(2, c) = c + 4. Now, LCM(2, c) is either c if c is even, or 2c if c is odd. Let's see:If c is even, then LCM(2, c) = c. So, c = c + 4, which implies 0 = 4. Not possible.If c is odd, then LCM(2, c) = 2c. So, 2c = c + 4. Subtract c: c = 4. But 4 is even, which contradicts our assumption that c is odd. So, no solution here either.Hmm, maybe a = 3. LCM(3, 3, c) = LCM(3, c). The equation becomes LCM(3, c) = 3 + 3 + c = 6 + c.Again, LCM(3, c) is either c if 3 divides c, or 3c otherwise.If 3 divides c, then LCM(3, c) = c. So, c = 6 + c, which implies 0 = 6. Not possible.If 3 doesn't divide c, then LCM(3, c) = 3c. So, 3c = 6 + c. Subtract c: 2c = 6, so c = 3. But 3 divides 3, which contradicts our assumption that 3 doesn't divide c. So, again, no solution.This seems like a dead end. Maybe assuming two numbers are equal isn't the way to go. Let me try a different approach.What if all three numbers are different? Let's say a < b < c. Then, LCM(a, b, c) must be a multiple of each of them. So, LCM(a, b, c) is at least as big as c, but in our equation, it's equal to a + b + c. So, a + b + c must be a multiple of c, which implies that a + b must be a multiple of c. But since a and b are both less than c, their sum is less than 2c. So, a + b can be either c or 0, but 0 isn't possible because a and b are positive. So, a + b = c.Wait, that's interesting. So, if a + b = c, then LCM(a, b, c) = a + b + c = 2c. So, LCM(a, b, c) = 2c. But LCM(a, b, c) must be a multiple of c, which it is, and also a multiple of a and b.So, 2c must be a multiple of a and b. That means a and b must divide 2c. Since a + b = c, let's express c as a + b. So, 2c = 2(a + b). Therefore, 2(a + b) must be a multiple of both a and b.So, 2(a + b) is divisible by a, which means that 2(a + b)/a = 2 + 2b/a must be an integer. Similarly, 2(a + b)/b = 2a/b + 2 must be an integer.Therefore, 2b/a and 2a/b must be integers. Let me denote k = b/a. Since a and b are positive integers, k is a positive rational number. Let me write k as m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers.So, b = (m/n)a. Since b must be an integer, a must be a multiple of n. Let me set a = n * t, where t is a positive integer. Then, b = m * t.So, now, c = a + b = n * t + m * t = (n + m) * t.Now, let's substitute back into the LCM condition. LCM(a, b, c) = LCM(n t, m t, (n + m) t). Since LCM is linear with respect to scaling, LCM(n t, m t, (n + m) t) = t * LCM(n, m, n + m).We know that LCM(a, b, c) = 2c = 2(n + m) t. So,t * LCM(n, m, n + m) = 2(n + m) t.Canceling t from both sides (since t ‚â† 0),LCM(n, m, n + m) = 2(n + m).So, now, we have to find positive integers n and m such that LCM(n, m, n + m) = 2(n + m).Also, since k = m/n is in lowest terms, m and n are coprime.So, n and m are coprime positive integers.Let me denote d = GCD(n, m). But since n and m are coprime, d = 1.So, n and m are coprime. Therefore, LCM(n, m) = n * m.Now, let's compute LCM(n, m, n + m). Since n and m are coprime, LCM(n, m) = n * m. Now, LCM(n * m, n + m).So, LCM(n * m, n + m). Let's denote this as LCM(nm, n + m).We need LCM(nm, n + m) = 2(n + m).So, LCM(nm, n + m) = 2(n + m). That implies that nm divides 2(n + m).Wait, no. LCM(nm, n + m) is the smallest number divisible by both nm and n + m. So, if LCM(nm, n + m) = 2(n + m), that means that 2(n + m) is divisible by nm. So, 2(n + m) must be a multiple of nm.So, 2(n + m) = k * nm, where k is a positive integer.But since n and m are positive integers, and coprime, let's see what possible k can be.Given that n and m are coprime, and 2(n + m) = k * nm.So, 2(n + m) must be divisible by nm. Since n and m are coprime, nm divides 2(n + m). So, n divides 2(n + m). Since n divides 2(n + m), and n divides 2n, it must divide 2m. But since n and m are coprime, n divides 2.Similarly, m divides 2(n + m). Since m divides 2(n + m), and m divides 2m, it must divide 2n. But m and n are coprime, so m divides 2.Therefore, n and m must be divisors of 2. Since n and m are positive integers and coprime, the possible pairs (n, m) are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1).Let's check each case:1. (n, m) = (1, 1):Then, 2(n + m) = 2(1 + 1) = 4.nm = 1 * 1 = 1.So, 4 = k * 1 ‚áí k = 4.So, LCM(nm, n + m) = LCM(1, 2) = 2. But we need it to be 2(n + m) = 4. So, 2 ‚â† 4. Not valid.2. (n, m) = (1, 2):Then, 2(n + m) = 2(1 + 2) = 6.nm = 1 * 2 = 2.So, 6 = k * 2 ‚áí k = 3.So, LCM(nm, n + m) = LCM(2, 3) = 6. And 2(n + m) = 6. So, 6 = 6. Valid.3. (n, m) = (2, 1):This is similar to the previous case, just swapping n and m.2(n + m) = 2(2 + 1) = 6.nm = 2 * 1 = 2.So, 6 = k * 2 ‚áí k = 3.LCM(nm, n + m) = LCM(2, 3) = 6. And 2(n + m) = 6. So, 6 = 6. Valid.So, the only valid pairs are (1, 2) and (2, 1).Therefore, n and m are either (1, 2) or (2, 1).Let's take (n, m) = (1, 2):Then, a = n * t = 1 * t = t.b = m * t = 2 * t.c = (n + m) * t = 3 * t.So, the triple is (t, 2t, 3t).Similarly, for (n, m) = (2, 1):a = 2t, b = t, c = 3t. But since we assumed a ‚â§ b ‚â§ c, we need to arrange them accordingly. So, if a = 2t and b = t, then t ‚â§ 2t, so t ‚â§ 2t is always true, but to maintain a ‚â§ b ‚â§ c, we need to have t ‚â§ 2t ‚â§ 3t, which is true. So, the triple is (t, 2t, 3t) regardless.So, the general solution is (t, 2t, 3t) for any positive integer t.Let me verify this solution.Take t = 1: (1, 2, 3). LCM(1, 2, 3) = 6. Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So, 6 = 6. Valid.Take t = 2: (2, 4, 6). LCM(2, 4, 6) = 12. Sum = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. Valid.Take t = 3: (3, 6, 9). LCM(3, 6, 9) = 18. Sum = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18. Valid.Seems consistent.Are there any other solutions? Let's see.Earlier, I assumed that a + b = c. Is that necessarily the case?Wait, I concluded that because LCM(a, b, c) = a + b + c, and since LCM(a, b, c) is a multiple of c, then a + b + c must be a multiple of c, meaning a + b is a multiple of c. But since a and b are less than or equal to c, their sum is less than or equal to 2c. So, the only possibility is a + b = c.Therefore, all solutions must satisfy a + b = c, and from there, we derived that the only solutions are triples of the form (t, 2t, 3t).Is there any other case where a + b is a multiple of c, but not equal to c? For example, a + b = 2c. But since a and b are less than or equal to c, their sum can't exceed 2c. So, a + b = c or 2c. But a + b = 2c would require a = b = c, which we saw earlier leads to a contradiction because LCM(a, a, a) = a, and sum is 3a, so a = 3a implies a = 0, which isn't positive.Therefore, the only possible case is a + b = c, leading to the solution (t, 2t, 3t).So, I think that's all the solutions. Let me just check if there are any other possibilities where a, b, c are not in arithmetic progression.Suppose a, b, c are such that LCM(a, b, c) = a + b + c, but they don't follow the ratio 1:2:3.For example, let's try a = 2, b = 3, c = 6. LCM(2, 3, 6) = 6. Sum = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11. 6 ‚â† 11. Not valid.Another example: a = 1, b = 3, c = 4. LCM(1, 3, 4) = 12. Sum = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Not equal.a = 1, b = 4, c = 5. LCM(1, 4, 5) = 20. Sum = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10. Not equal.a = 2, b = 4, c = 6. LCM(2, 4, 6) = 12. Sum = 12. So, this works, but it's part of our earlier solution (t=2).a = 3, b = 6, c = 9. LCM(3, 6, 9) = 18. Sum = 18. Works, again part of our solution.What about a = 1, b = 2, c = 3. LCM(1, 2, 3) = 6. Sum = 6. Works.Another test: a = 1, b = 1, c = 2. LCM(1, 1, 2) = 2. Sum = 4. Not equal.a = 1, b = 2, c = 4. LCM(1, 2, 4) = 4. Sum = 7. Not equal.a = 2, b = 3, c = 5. LCM(2, 3, 5) = 30. Sum = 10. Not equal.a = 2, b = 3, c = 6. LCM(2, 3, 6) = 6. Sum = 11. Not equal.a = 3, b = 4, c = 12. LCM(3, 4, 12) = 12. Sum = 19. Not equal.Hmm, seems like all the valid examples I can think of are of the form (t, 2t, 3t). Therefore, I think that's the only solution.So, to summarize, all positive integer solutions are triples where the numbers are in the ratio 1:2:3. That is, (a, b, c) = (k, 2k, 3k) for some positive integer k.**Final Answer**The positive integer solutions are all triples where the numbers are in the ratio 1:2:3. Thus, the solutions are given by boxed{(a, 2a, 3a)} for any positive integer (a)."},{"question":"Given 60 feet of fencing, what is the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen, if one of the side lengths must be at least 15 feet?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the greatest possible area of a rectangular pen using 60 feet of fencing. But there's a catch: one of the side lengths has to be at least 15 feet. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter (P) is:[ P = 2 times (length + width) ]In this case, the perimeter is given as 60 feet. So, plugging that into the formula:[ 60 = 2 times (length + width) ]If I divide both sides by 2 to simplify:[ 30 = length + width ]Alright, so the sum of the length and the width is 30 feet. Now, the problem states that one of the side lengths must be at least 15 feet. Let's assume that the length is the one that has to be at least 15 feet. So, length ‚â• 15 feet.Given that, the width would be:[ width = 30 - length ]Since length is at least 15, the width would be at most 15 feet because 30 - 15 = 15. So, if length is 15, width is also 15, making it a square. If length is more than 15, width becomes less than 15.Now, the area (A) of a rectangle is given by:[ A = length times width ]Substituting the expression for width from earlier:[ A = length times (30 - length) ][ A = 30 times length - length^2 ]So, the area is a quadratic equation in terms of length. Quadratic equations have either a maximum or a minimum value, depending on the coefficient of the squared term. In this case, the coefficient of length squared is -1, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.The vertex of a parabola given by ( A = -length^2 + 30 times length ) can be found using the formula:[ length = -frac{b}{2a} ]Where ( a = -1 ) and ( b = 30 ). Plugging in these values:[ length = -frac{30}{2 times (-1)} ][ length = -frac{30}{-2} ][ length = 15 ]So, the length that gives the maximum area is 15 feet. Since the length is 15 feet, the width is also 15 feet, making the pen a square. Calculating the area:[ A = 15 times 15 = 225 text{ square feet} ]But wait, the problem specifies that one of the side lengths must be at least 15 feet. In this case, both sides are exactly 15 feet, which satisfies the condition. So, the maximum area is indeed 225 square feet.Just to double-check, if I choose a length slightly more than 15, say 16 feet, then the width would be 14 feet. Calculating the area:[ A = 16 times 14 = 224 text{ square feet} ]That's less than 225. Similarly, if I choose a length of 17 feet, the width is 13 feet:[ A = 17 times 13 = 221 text{ square feet} ]Again, less than 225. What if I go the other way, making the length exactly 15 feet? Then the width is also 15 feet, and the area is 225 square feet, which is higher. So, it seems that 15 feet for both sides gives the maximum area under the given constraints.Therefore, the greatest possible area is 225 square feet when the pen is a square with each side measuring 15 feet."},{"question":"[Reading Material] First carefully read the material, then try to solve the problem. The formula for the square of the sum (difference) of two numbers, x^{2}pm 2xy+y^{2}=left(xpm yright)^{2}, and the fact that the value of left(xpm yright)^{2} is always non-negative, have wide applications in mathematical studies. For example, when exploring the minimum value of the polynomial x^{2}+6x-4, we can proceed as follows: Solution: The original expression =x^{2}+6x-4=x^{2}+6x+9-9-4=left(x+3right)^{2}-13=left(x+3right)^{2}-13. Since the value of left(x+3right)^{2} is always non-negative regardless of the value of x, the minimum value of left(x+3right)^{2} is 0, which occurs when x=-3. Therefore, the minimum value of left(x+3right)^{2}-13 is 0-13=-13. Thus, when x=-3, the minimum value of the original polynomial is -13.Problem: Following the above solution approach, determine the maximum value of the polynomial -3x^{2}-6x+12 and write down the corresponding values of x.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the polynomial (-3x^2 - 6x + 12). Hmm, I remember from the reading material that completing the square is a useful method for finding the minimum or maximum value of a quadratic polynomial. Let me try to apply that here.First, the polynomial is (-3x^2 - 6x + 12). I notice that the coefficient of (x^2) is negative, which means the parabola opens downward. That tells me that the vertex of this parabola will be its highest point, so the y-value of the vertex will be the maximum value of the polynomial.To complete the square, I think I should factor out the coefficient of (x^2) first. So, let me factor out (-3) from the first two terms:[-3x^2 - 6x + 12 = -3(x^2 + 2x) + 12]Okay, now I have (-3(x^2 + 2x) + 12). The next step is to complete the square inside the parentheses. To do that, I need to take half of the coefficient of (x), which is 2, so half of that is 1, and then square it, which gives me 1. So, I need to add and subtract 1 inside the parentheses to complete the square.But wait, since I'm adding 1 inside the parentheses, and it's multiplied by (-3), I have to adjust for that when I add it back to the equation. Let me write that out:[-3(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + 12 = -3[(x + 1)^2 - 1] + 12]Now, distribute the (-3) across the terms inside the brackets:[-3(x + 1)^2 + 3 + 12]Combine the constants:[-3(x + 1)^2 + 15]So, the polynomial can be rewritten as (-3(x + 1)^2 + 15). Now, since ((x + 1)^2) is always non-negative (because any real number squared is non-negative), the term (-3(x + 1)^2) will always be non-positive. That means the maximum value occurs when ((x + 1)^2) is as small as possible, which is 0.When does ((x + 1)^2 = 0)? That happens when (x + 1 = 0), so (x = -1).Plugging (x = -1) back into the expression (-3(x + 1)^2 + 15), we get:[-3(0) + 15 = 15]Therefore, the maximum value of the polynomial is 15, and it occurs when (x = -1).I think that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I factored out (-3), completed the square correctly by adding and subtracting 1, distributed the (-3), and combined the constants. Then, I identified that the maximum occurs at (x = -1) because the squared term is zero there, giving the highest possible value. Yeah, that seems right."},{"question":"For a positive integer ( n (n geqslant 2) ), let ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{n}{(n-k) 2^{k-1}} ).Find the maximum value in the sequence ( {a_n} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value in the sequence ( {a_n} ) where each term is defined as ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ) for positive integers ( n geq 2 ). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I think I should compute ( a_n ) for some small values of ( n ) to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out where the maximum might occur. Let me start with ( n = 2 ).For ( n = 2 ):[a_2 = sum_{k=1}^{1} frac{2}{(2 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{2}{1 times 1} = 2]So, ( a_2 = 2 ).Next, ( n = 3 ):[a_3 = sum_{k=1}^{2} frac{3}{(3 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Calculating each term:- When ( k = 1 ): ( frac{3}{(3 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{3}{2 times 1} = frac{3}{2} )- When ( k = 2 ): ( frac{3}{(3 - 2) 2^{1}} = frac{3}{1 times 2} = frac{3}{2} )Adding them up: ( frac{3}{2} + frac{3}{2} = 3 ). So, ( a_3 = 3 ).Moving on to ( n = 4 ):[a_4 = sum_{k=1}^{3} frac{4}{(4 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Calculating each term:- ( k = 1 ): ( frac{4}{(4 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{4}{3 times 1} = frac{4}{3} )- ( k = 2 ): ( frac{4}{(4 - 2) 2^{1}} = frac{4}{2 times 2} = 1 )- ( k = 3 ): ( frac{4}{(4 - 3) 2^{2}} = frac{4}{1 times 4} = 1 )Adding them up: ( frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1 = frac{4}{3} + frac{3}{3} + frac{3}{3} = frac{10}{3} ). So, ( a_4 = frac{10}{3} ).Now, ( n = 5 ):[a_5 = sum_{k=1}^{4} frac{5}{(5 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Calculating each term:- ( k = 1 ): ( frac{5}{(5 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{5}{4 times 1} = frac{5}{4} )- ( k = 2 ): ( frac{5}{(5 - 2) 2^{1}} = frac{5}{3 times 2} = frac{5}{6} )- ( k = 3 ): ( frac{5}{(5 - 3) 2^{2}} = frac{5}{2 times 4} = frac{5}{8} )- ( k = 4 ): ( frac{5}{(5 - 4) 2^{3}} = frac{5}{1 times 8} = frac{5}{8} )Adding them up: ( frac{5}{4} + frac{5}{6} + frac{5}{8} + frac{5}{8} ). Let me find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4, 6, 8, and 8. The least common multiple of 4, 6, and 8 is 24.Converting each term:- ( frac{5}{4} = frac{30}{24} )- ( frac{5}{6} = frac{20}{24} )- ( frac{5}{8} = frac{15}{24} )- Another ( frac{5}{8} = frac{15}{24} )Adding them up: ( frac{30}{24} + frac{20}{24} + frac{15}{24} + frac{15}{24} = frac{80}{24} = frac{10}{3} ). So, ( a_5 = frac{10}{3} ).Hmm, interesting. Both ( a_4 ) and ( a_5 ) are equal to ( frac{10}{3} ). Let me check ( n = 6 ) to see if the trend continues or if it starts decreasing.For ( n = 6 ):[a_6 = sum_{k=1}^{5} frac{6}{(6 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Calculating each term:- ( k = 1 ): ( frac{6}{(6 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{6}{5 times 1} = frac{6}{5} )- ( k = 2 ): ( frac{6}{(6 - 2) 2^{1}} = frac{6}{4 times 2} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4} )- ( k = 3 ): ( frac{6}{(6 - 3) 2^{2}} = frac{6}{3 times 4} = frac{6}{12} = frac{1}{2} )- ( k = 4 ): ( frac{6}{(6 - 4) 2^{3}} = frac{6}{2 times 8} = frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8} )- ( k = 5 ): ( frac{6}{(6 - 5) 2^{4}} = frac{6}{1 times 16} = frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8} )Adding them up: ( frac{6}{5} + frac{3}{4} + frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{8} + frac{3}{8} ). Let's convert them to a common denominator, which is 40.Converting each term:- ( frac{6}{5} = frac{48}{40} )- ( frac{3}{4} = frac{30}{40} )- ( frac{1}{2} = frac{20}{40} )- ( frac{3}{8} = frac{15}{40} )- Another ( frac{3}{8} = frac{15}{40} )Adding them up: ( frac{48}{40} + frac{30}{40} + frac{20}{40} + frac{15}{40} + frac{15}{40} = frac{128}{40} = frac{16}{5} = 3.2 ). So, ( a_6 = frac{16}{5} ), which is approximately 3.2, less than ( frac{10}{3} ) (which is approximately 3.333...).Okay, so ( a_6 ) is less than ( a_4 ) and ( a_5 ). Let me try ( n = 7 ) to see if it continues decreasing.For ( n = 7 ):[a_7 = sum_{k=1}^{6} frac{7}{(7 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Calculating each term:- ( k = 1 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 1) 2^{0}} = frac{7}{6 times 1} = frac{7}{6} )- ( k = 2 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 2) 2^{1}} = frac{7}{5 times 2} = frac{7}{10} )- ( k = 3 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 3) 2^{2}} = frac{7}{4 times 4} = frac{7}{16} )- ( k = 4 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 4) 2^{3}} = frac{7}{3 times 8} = frac{7}{24} )- ( k = 5 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 5) 2^{4}} = frac{7}{2 times 16} = frac{7}{32} )- ( k = 6 ): ( frac{7}{(7 - 6) 2^{5}} = frac{7}{1 times 32} = frac{7}{32} )Adding them up: ( frac{7}{6} + frac{7}{10} + frac{7}{16} + frac{7}{24} + frac{7}{32} + frac{7}{32} ). Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 10, 16, 24, 32, 32. The least common multiple of these numbers is 480.Converting each term:- ( frac{7}{6} = frac{560}{480} )- ( frac{7}{10} = frac{336}{480} )- ( frac{7}{16} = frac{210}{480} )- ( frac{7}{24} = frac{140}{480} )- ( frac{7}{32} = frac{105}{480} )- Another ( frac{7}{32} = frac{105}{480} )Adding them up: ( frac{560}{480} + frac{336}{480} + frac{210}{480} + frac{140}{480} + frac{105}{480} + frac{105}{480} = frac{1456}{480} ).Simplifying ( frac{1456}{480} ): Divide numerator and denominator by 16: ( frac{91}{30} approx 3.033 ). So, ( a_7 approx 3.033 ), which is less than ( frac{10}{3} ).It seems like after ( n = 5 ), the values of ( a_n ) start decreasing. So, the maximum value occurs at ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 5 ), both giving ( a_n = frac{10}{3} ).But just to be thorough, let me check ( n = 1 ) even though the problem states ( n geq 2 ). For ( n = 1 ), the sum would be from ( k = 1 ) to ( 0 ), which doesn't make sense, so it's not considered.Now, to make sure that ( frac{10}{3} ) is indeed the maximum, I should consider whether ( a_n ) could be larger for some larger ( n ). However, from the calculations above, as ( n ) increases beyond 5, ( a_n ) seems to decrease. To confirm this, perhaps I can analyze the general term or find a pattern.Looking at the general term ( frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ), as ( n ) increases, the denominator ( (n - k) 2^{k - 1} ) grows, but the numerator ( n ) also grows. It's not immediately clear how the sum behaves as ( n ) increases. Maybe I can consider the behavior as ( n ) approaches infinity.Alternatively, perhaps I can find a recursive relation or express ( a_n ) in terms of ( a_{n-1} ) or something similar. Let me see.Let me consider ( a_{n+1} ):[a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{n+1}{(n+1 - k) 2^{k - 1}}]Notice that ( n+1 - k = (n - (k - 1)) ). So, maybe I can rewrite the sum in terms of ( a_n ).Let me make a substitution: let ( m = k - 1 ). Then when ( k = 1 ), ( m = 0 ), and when ( k = n ), ( m = n - 1 ). So, the sum becomes:[a_{n+1} = sum_{m=0}^{n-1} frac{n+1}{(n - m) 2^{m}}]Which can be rewritten as:[a_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n} + sum_{m=1}^{n-1} frac{n+1}{(n - m) 2^{m}}]Notice that the sum from ( m=1 ) to ( n-1 ) is similar to ( a_n ), but scaled by ( frac{n+1}{n} ) and multiplied by ( frac{1}{2} ).Wait, let's see:[sum_{m=1}^{n-1} frac{n+1}{(n - m) 2^{m}} = frac{n+1}{2} sum_{m=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{(n - m) 2^{m - 1}} = frac{n+1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} times frac{1}{n} times (n - k)]Wait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think differently.Let me denote ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ). Then, ( a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{n+1}{(n+1 - k) 2^{k - 1}} ).Let me split the sum into two parts: the first term when ( k = 1 ) and the rest.So,[a_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{(n+1 - 1) 2^{0}} + sum_{k=2}^{n} frac{n+1}{(n+1 - k) 2^{k - 1}} = frac{n+1}{n} + sum_{k=2}^{n} frac{n+1}{(n - (k - 1)) 2^{k - 1}}]Let me make a substitution in the sum: let ( m = k - 1 ). Then, when ( k = 2 ), ( m = 1 ), and when ( k = n ), ( m = n - 1 ). So, the sum becomes:[sum_{m=1}^{n - 1} frac{n+1}{(n - m) 2^{m}}]Which is:[sum_{m=1}^{n - 1} frac{n+1}{(n - m) 2^{m}} = frac{n+1}{2} sum_{m=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{(n - m) 2^{m - 1}} = frac{n+1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{k 2^{k - 1}}]Wait, because ( n - m = k ), so when ( m = 1 ), ( k = n - 1 ), and when ( m = n - 1 ), ( k = 1 ). So, actually, the sum is:[frac{n+1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{k 2^{k - 1}}]But this seems a bit different from ( a_n ). Let me see if I can relate this to ( a_n ).Wait, ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ). So, if I factor out ( n ), it's ( n sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ).But in the expression for ( a_{n+1} ), we have ( frac{n+1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{k 2^{k - 1}} ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( a_{n+1} ) in terms of ( a_n ). Let me see:From the earlier step:[a_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{k 2^{k - 1}}]But ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ). Let me denote ( S = sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{1}{k 2^{k - 1}} ). Then, ( a_n = n S ).Wait, no, because ( a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ). So, it's not exactly ( n S ), because the denominator is ( (n - k) ), not ( k ).Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the most straightforward. Let me think about another way.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the behavior of ( a_n ) as ( n ) increases. From the computed values, ( a_2 = 2 ), ( a_3 = 3 ), ( a_4 = frac{10}{3} approx 3.333 ), ( a_5 = frac{10}{3} approx 3.333 ), ( a_6 = frac{16}{5} = 3.2 ), ( a_7 approx 3.033 ). It seems like ( a_n ) increases up to ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 5 ), and then starts decreasing.To confirm whether ( frac{10}{3} ) is indeed the maximum, I can try to see if ( a_n ) is increasing up to ( n = 5 ) and then decreasing. Let me compute ( a_6 ) and ( a_7 ) again to make sure.Wait, I already did ( a_6 ) and ( a_7 ), and both are less than ( frac{10}{3} ). So, it's likely that ( frac{10}{3} ) is the maximum.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference ( a_{n+1} - a_n ) to see if it's positive or negative. Let me try that.Compute ( a_{n+1} - a_n ):[a_{n+1} - a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{n+1}{(n+1 - k) 2^{k - 1}} - sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}}]This looks complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or bound.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio ( frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} ) to see if it's increasing or decreasing.But this might not be straightforward either.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the general term ( frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ) and see how it behaves as ( n ) increases.Wait, for fixed ( k ), as ( n ) increases, ( n - k ) increases, so the term ( frac{n}{(n - k) 2^{k - 1}} ) approaches ( frac{1}{2^{k - 1}} ) as ( n ) becomes large. So, the sum ( a_n ) approaches ( sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{k - 1}} ), which is a geometric series with ratio ( frac{1}{2} ), so it converges to ( 2 ). Therefore, as ( n ) approaches infinity, ( a_n ) approaches 2, which is less than ( frac{10}{3} ).Therefore, the maximum must occur somewhere before ( n ) becomes too large, and from the computed values, it's at ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 5 ).Alternatively, perhaps I can consider taking the derivative, but since ( n ) is an integer, calculus might not directly apply. However, maybe I can treat ( n ) as a continuous variable and find where the function peaks.Let me consider ( a_n ) as a function of ( n ). Then, perhaps I can find its maximum by taking the derivative. But since ( a_n ) is defined as a sum, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the sum for large ( n ) and find where it's maximized.But given that I've already computed up to ( n = 7 ) and seen that ( a_n ) peaks at ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 5 ), and then decreases, I think it's safe to conclude that the maximum value is ( frac{10}{3} ).Therefore, the maximum value in the sequence ( {a_n} ) is ( frac{10}{3} )."},{"question":"Given non-negative real numbers ( a, b, c, d ) that satisfy the equation[ab + bc + cd + da = 1,]prove that[frac{a^3}{b + c + d} + frac{b^3}{a + c + d} + frac{c^3}{a + b + d} + frac{d^3}{a + b + c} geq frac{1}{3}.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality problem with four non-negative real numbers a, b, c, d. The condition given is ab + bc + cd + da = 1, and I need to prove that the sum of a^3/(b + c + d) and similar terms is at least 1/3. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I should note that all variables are non-negative, which might be helpful because it means I don't have to worry about negative values complicating things. The condition ab + bc + cd + da = 1 is interesting. It's a symmetric expression but not entirely symmetric because each term involves two variables. Maybe I can find some symmetry or apply known inequalities here.Looking at the expression I need to prove, it's a sum of fractions where each numerator is a cube of one variable, and the denominator is the sum of the other three. So, for example, the first term is a^3 divided by (b + c + d). This structure reminds me of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or maybe the Titu's lemma, which are often used in such situations.Wait, Titu's lemma is a specific case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and is useful for sums of fractions where the numerators are squares. But here, the numerators are cubes. Maybe I can manipulate it somehow to fit into Titu's lemma or another inequality.Alternatively, I recall that sometimes when dealing with fractions like this, we can use the AM-GM inequality or H√∂lder's inequality. H√∂lder's might be a good candidate here because it can handle products and sums in a more flexible way.Let me think about H√∂lder's inequality. It states that for positive real numbers, the sum of products is less than or equal to the product of sums raised to certain powers, depending on the exponents. Maybe I can set up the inequality in a way that allows me to apply H√∂lder.But before jumping into that, perhaps I should consider the given condition ab + bc + cd + da = 1. This seems like a key piece of information that I need to incorporate into my proof. Maybe I can express the denominators in terms of this condition or find a relationship between the variables.Let me denote S = a + b + c + d. Then, each denominator in the expression is S minus one of the variables. So, for example, b + c + d = S - a. So, the expression becomes:(a^3)/(S - a) + (b^3)/(S - b) + (c^3)/(S - c) + (d^3)/(S - d) ‚â• 1/3.Hmm, that's an interesting way to rewrite it. Now, I have a sum of terms where each term is a variable cubed divided by (S minus that variable). Maybe I can find a way to relate this to the given condition.I wonder if I can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality here. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in its general form is (sum u_i v_i)^2 ‚â§ (sum u_i^2)(sum v_i^2). But I'm not sure how to apply it directly here.Wait, maybe I can use the Titu's lemma version, which is sum (a_i^2 / b_i) ‚â• (sum a_i)^2 / sum b_i. But in my case, the numerators are cubes, not squares. Maybe I can manipulate the terms to fit this form.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality on the denominators. The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. But I'm not sure how that would help here because the denominators are sums, not products.Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider the function f(x) = x^3 / (S - x). Is this function convex or concave? If it's convex, then I can apply Jensen's inequality. Let me check the second derivative to determine convexity.The first derivative f'(x) would be [3x^2(S - x) + x^3] / (S - x)^2 = [3x^2S - 3x^3 + x^3] / (S - x)^2 = [3x^2S - 2x^3] / (S - x)^2.The second derivative f''(x) would be more complicated, but perhaps I can see the sign. If f''(x) is positive, then f is convex. If it's negative, then f is concave. Without calculating it exactly, it's hard to tell, but maybe I can assume it's convex for positive x.If f is convex, then by Jensen's inequality, the sum would be greater than or equal to 4 times f of the average. But I'm not sure if that helps because I don't know the average of the variables.Wait, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different way. Let me consider the sum as sum (a^3)/(S - a). If I write this as sum (a^3)/(S - a) = sum (a^4)/(a(S - a)). Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, this is greater than or equal to (sum a^2)^2 / sum [a(S - a)].So, applying Cauchy-Schwarz in this form, I get:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• (sum a^2)^2 / sum [a(S - a)].Now, let's compute the denominator sum [a(S - a)] = sum (aS - a^2) = S sum a - sum a^2 = S^2 - sum a^2.So, the inequality becomes:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• (sum a^2)^2 / (S^2 - sum a^2).Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I need to relate this to the given condition ab + bc + cd + da = 1.Let me denote Q = ab + bc + cd + da = 1. I need to find a relationship between sum a^2 and Q.I know that (a + b + c + d)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd). But our Q is ab + bc + cd + da, which is a subset of these terms.So, let's compute S^2:S^2 = (a + b + c + d)^2 = sum a^2 + 2(sum ab).But sum ab includes all pairs, which is ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd. However, our Q is ab + bc + cd + da, which is ab + bc + cd + da. So, Q = ab + bc + cd + da.Therefore, sum ab = Q + ac + bd.So, S^2 = sum a^2 + 2(Q + ac + bd).But I don't know ac and bd. Hmm, maybe I can find a lower bound for sum a^2 in terms of Q.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on Q. Since Q = ab + bc + cd + da, which can be written as ab + bc + cd + da.Wait, maybe I can group terms: ab + bc + cd + da = b(a + c) + d(a + c) = (a + c)(b + d). So, Q = (a + c)(b + d) = 1.That's a useful factorization! So, (a + c)(b + d) = 1.Let me denote p = a + c and q = b + d. Then, pq = 1.Also, S = a + b + c + d = p + q.Now, let's express sum a^2 in terms of p and q. We have:sum a^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2.We can write this as (a^2 + c^2) + (b^2 + d^2).Using the identity that a^2 + c^2 ‚â• (a + c)^2 / 2 by Cauchy-Schwarz, similarly for b^2 + d^2.So, a^2 + c^2 ‚â• p^2 / 2 and b^2 + d^2 ‚â• q^2 / 2.Therefore, sum a^2 ‚â• (p^2 + q^2)/2.But since pq = 1, we can express p^2 + q^2 in terms of p or q.We know that p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq = S^2 - 2.So, sum a^2 ‚â• (S^2 - 2)/2.Hmm, that's a lower bound for sum a^2.Going back to the inequality we had earlier:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• (sum a^2)^2 / (S^2 - sum a^2).Let me denote T = sum a^2. Then, the inequality becomes:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• T^2 / (S^2 - T).We have T ‚â• (S^2 - 2)/2.So, let's substitute T with (S^2 - 2)/2 in the denominator:S^2 - T ‚â§ S^2 - (S^2 - 2)/2 = (2S^2 - S^2 + 2)/2 = (S^2 + 2)/2.Therefore, the denominator S^2 - T ‚â§ (S^2 + 2)/2.So, the inequality becomes:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• T^2 / [(S^2 + 2)/2] = 2T^2 / (S^2 + 2).Now, we have T ‚â• (S^2 - 2)/2, so let's substitute T with (S^2 - 2)/2:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• 2[(S^2 - 2)/2]^2 / (S^2 + 2) = 2[(S^4 - 4S^2 + 4)/4] / (S^2 + 2) = [ (S^4 - 4S^2 + 4)/2 ] / (S^2 + 2).Simplify numerator:(S^4 - 4S^2 + 4) = (S^2 - 2)^2.So, we have:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• [ (S^2 - 2)^2 / 2 ] / (S^2 + 2) = (S^2 - 2)^2 / [2(S^2 + 2)].Now, let's denote R = S^2. Then, the expression becomes:(R - 2)^2 / [2(R + 2)].We need to show that this is at least 1/3.So, we have:(R - 2)^2 / [2(R + 2)] ‚â• 1/3.Multiply both sides by 2(R + 2):(R - 2)^2 ‚â• (2/3)(R + 2).Expand the left side:R^2 - 4R + 4 ‚â• (2/3)R + 4/3.Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:3R^2 - 12R + 12 ‚â• 2R + 4.Bring all terms to the left:3R^2 - 14R + 8 ‚â• 0.Now, solve the quadratic inequality 3R^2 - 14R + 8 ‚â• 0.Find the roots:R = [14 ¬± sqrt(196 - 96)] / 6 = [14 ¬± sqrt(100)] / 6 = [14 ¬± 10]/6.So, R = (14 + 10)/6 = 24/6 = 4, and R = (14 - 10)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.The quadratic opens upwards (since coefficient of R^2 is positive), so the inequality holds when R ‚â§ 2/3 or R ‚â• 4.But R = S^2, and S = a + b + c + d. Since a, b, c, d are non-negative, S ‚â• 0.But from the condition (a + c)(b + d) = 1, we can find a lower bound for S.Using AM-GM on p and q: (p + q)/2 ‚â• sqrt(pq) = 1. So, p + q ‚â• 2. Therefore, S = p + q ‚â• 2.So, R = S^2 ‚â• 4.Therefore, R ‚â• 4, which means the inequality 3R^2 - 14R + 8 ‚â• 0 holds because R ‚â• 4 is in the region where the quadratic is positive.Thus, we have:sum (a^3)/(S - a) ‚â• (R - 2)^2 / [2(R + 2)] ‚â• 1/3.Therefore, the original inequality holds:(a^3)/(b + c + d) + (b^3)/(a + c + d) + (c^3)/(a + b + d) + (d^3)/(a + b + c) ‚â• 1/3.I think this approach works. I used Cauchy-Schwarz to transform the original sum into a fraction involving sum a^2 and S, then related sum a^2 to S using the given condition and some inequalities. Finally, I showed that the resulting expression is at least 1/3 by analyzing the quadratic inequality. It seems a bit involved, but each step follows logically."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfies a_3 = 2, and the sum of the first 3 terms S_3 = frac{9}{2}.(1) Find the general formula for {a_n};(2) Suppose a geometric sequence {b_n} satisfies b_1 = a_1, b_4 = a_{15}, find the sum of the first n terms T_n of {b_n}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence and a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, part (1) says: Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfies a_3 = 2, and the sum of the first 3 terms S_3 = 9/2. I need to find the general formula for {a_n}.Alright, arithmetic sequences have a common difference, right? So, if I denote the first term as a_1 and the common difference as d, then the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.Given that a_3 = 2, so plugging into the formula: a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 2. That's equation one.Also, the sum of the first 3 terms is S_3 = 9/2. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d). So, for n=3, S_3 = 3/2 * (2a_1 + 2d) = 9/2.Let me write that down:1. a_1 + 2d = 22. (3/2)(2a_1 + 2d) = 9/2Hmm, let me simplify the second equation. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:3*(2a_1 + 2d) = 9Divide both sides by 3:2a_1 + 2d = 3I can factor out a 2:2(a_1 + d) = 3Divide both sides by 2:a_1 + d = 3/2So now I have two equations:1. a_1 + 2d = 22. a_1 + d = 3/2I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a_1:(a_1 + 2d) - (a_1 + d) = 2 - 3/2Simplify:a_1 + 2d - a_1 - d = 1/2Which simplifies to:d = 1/2Okay, so the common difference d is 1/2. Now, plug this back into equation 2:a_1 + (1/2) = 3/2Subtract 1/2 from both sides:a_1 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1So, the first term a_1 is 1, and the common difference d is 1/2.Therefore, the general formula for the arithmetic sequence is:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)(1/2)Let me simplify that:1 + (n - 1)/2 = (2 + n - 1)/2 = (n + 1)/2So, a_n = (n + 1)/2. That seems right.Let me double-check with the given conditions.First, a_3 should be 2:a_3 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Correct.Sum of the first 3 terms:a_1 = 1, a_2 = (2 + 1)/2 = 3/2, a_3 = 2.Sum: 1 + 3/2 + 2 = (2 + 3 + 4)/2 = 9/2. Correct.Alright, part (1) seems done. The general formula is a_n = (n + 1)/2.Now, part (2): Suppose a geometric sequence {b_n} satisfies b_1 = a_1, b_4 = a_{15}. Find the sum of the first n terms T_n of {b_n}.Okay, so first, let's note that b_1 = a_1. From part (1), a_1 = 1, so b_1 = 1.Also, b_4 = a_{15}. Let's compute a_{15} using the formula from part (1):a_{15} = (15 + 1)/2 = 16/2 = 8. So, b_4 = 8.Now, since {b_n} is a geometric sequence, it has a common ratio r. The nth term of a geometric sequence is b_n = b_1 * r^{n-1}.Given that b_4 = 8, and b_1 = 1, so:b_4 = b_1 * r^{3} = 1 * r^3 = r^3 = 8Therefore, r^3 = 8. So, r = cube root of 8 = 2. So, the common ratio r is 2.Now, the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is T_n = b_1 * (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) when r ‚â† 1.Plugging in the values:T_n = 1 * (1 - 2^n)/(1 - 2) = (1 - 2^n)/(-1) = (2^n - 1)/1 = 2^n - 1.So, T_n = 2^n - 1.Let me verify this with a small n, say n=1: T_1 should be b_1 =1. 2^1 -1=1. Correct.n=2: b_1 + b_2 =1 + 2=3. 2^2 -1=4 -1=3. Correct.n=3:1 +2 +4=7. 2^3 -1=8 -1=7. Correct.n=4:1 +2 +4 +8=15. 2^4 -1=16 -1=15. Correct.So, the formula seems to hold.Therefore, the sum of the first n terms of {b_n} is 2^n -1.**Final Answer**(1) The general formula for {a_n} is boxed{a_n = frac{n + 1}{2}}.(2) The sum of the first n terms of {b_n} is boxed{T_n = 2^n - 1}."},{"question":"Given the radius of the circumscribed circle of a triangle, one side, and the ratio of the other two sides. What are the lengths of the sides and the angles of the triangle?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lengths of the sides and the angles of a triangle. The information given is the radius of the circumscribed circle (which is the circumradius), one side of the triangle, and the ratio of the other two sides. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that in any triangle, the relationship between the sides and the circumradius is given by the formula involving the sine of the angles. Specifically, the Law of Sines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively, and circumradius R, the following holds:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R]So, if I know the circumradius R, and one side, say a, I can find the sine of angle A. That seems straightforward. Let me write that down:[sin A = frac{a}{2R}]Okay, so that gives me angle A. But I also know the ratio of the other two sides, b:c = Œª. So, if I let b = Œªc, then I can express everything in terms of c. Hmm, but how does that help me find the actual lengths?I think I need another equation to relate these variables. Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines? But wait, I don't know any angles yet except for angle A. Hmm, maybe I can express angles B and C in terms of angle A since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.So, A + B + C = 180¬∞, which means B + C = 180¬∞ - A. That might be useful later.Since I know the ratio of sides b and c, and from the Law of Sines, I can relate the sines of angles B and C. Specifically:[frac{sin B}{sin C} = frac{b}{c} = lambda]So, sin B = Œª sin C. That's an important relationship.Now, since B + C = 180¬∞ - A, I can write B = 180¬∞ - A - C. Then, using the sine addition formula:[sin B = sin(180¬∞ - A - C) = sin(A + C)]Wait, no, sin(180¬∞ - x) = sin x, so actually:[sin B = sin(A + C)]But I also have sin B = Œª sin C. So,[sin(A + C) = lambda sin C]Expanding sin(A + C) using the sine addition formula:[sin A cos C + cos A sin C = lambda sin C]Now, I can rearrange this equation:[sin A cos C = (lambda - cos A) sin C]Dividing both sides by sin C (assuming sin C ‚â† 0, which it can't be in a triangle):[frac{sin A}{sin C} cos C = lambda - cos A]Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can express cot C from this equation. Let's see:[cot C = frac{cos C}{sin C} = frac{lambda - cos A}{sin A}]Ah, that's better. So, cot C is expressed in terms of Œª and angle A. Since I already have sin A from earlier, I can find cos A as well:[cos A = sqrt{1 - sin^2 A} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{a}{2R}right)^2}]So, plugging that back into the expression for cot C:[cot C = frac{lambda - sqrt{1 - left(frac{a}{2R}right)^2}}{frac{a}{2R}} = frac{2R}{a} left( lambda - sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right)]Okay, so now I have cot C in terms of known quantities. From cot C, I can find sin C because:[sin C = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + cot^2 C}}]Plugging in the expression for cot C:[sin C = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + left( frac{2R}{a} left( lambda - sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right) right)^2}}]That looks complicated, but let's try to simplify it step by step. First, let's compute the denominator:[sqrt{1 + left( frac{2R}{a} left( lambda - sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right) right)^2}]Let me square the term inside the square root:[left( frac{2R}{a} left( lambda - sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right) right)^2 = frac{4R^2}{a^2} left( lambda - sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right)^2]Expanding the square:[frac{4R^2}{a^2} left( lambda^2 - 2lambda sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} + 1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2} right)]Simplify inside the brackets:[lambda^2 + 1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2} - 2lambda sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}}]So, putting it all together:[sqrt{1 + frac{4R^2}{a^2} left( lambda^2 + 1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2} - 2lambda sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}} right)}]Simplify the terms inside the square root:[1 + frac{4R^2}{a^2} lambda^2 + frac{4R^2}{a^2} - 1 - frac{4R^2}{a^2} cdot frac{a^2}{4R^2} - frac{8R^2 lambda}{a^2} sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{4R^2}}]Wait, let's compute each term:- 1- + (4R¬≤/a¬≤)(Œª¬≤ + 1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))- - (8R¬≤Œª/a¬≤) sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))Let me compute term by term:1. 12. (4R¬≤/a¬≤)(Œª¬≤) = 4R¬≤Œª¬≤/a¬≤3. (4R¬≤/a¬≤)(1) = 4R¬≤/a¬≤4. (4R¬≤/a¬≤)(-a¬≤/(4R¬≤)) = -15. - (8R¬≤Œª/a¬≤) sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))So, combining these:1 + 4R¬≤Œª¬≤/a¬≤ + 4R¬≤/a¬≤ - 1 - (8R¬≤Œª/a¬≤) sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))Simplify:1 - 1 cancels out.So, we have:4R¬≤Œª¬≤/a¬≤ + 4R¬≤/a¬≤ - (8R¬≤Œª/a¬≤) sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))Factor out 4R¬≤/a¬≤:4R¬≤/a¬≤ (Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)))So, the denominator becomes:sqrt(4R¬≤/a¬≤ (Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)))) = (2R/a) sqrt(Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)))Therefore, sin C is:1 / [ (2R/a) sqrt(Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))) ] = a / [2R sqrt(Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)))]So, sin C = a / [2R sqrt(Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)))]Wait, that seems a bit convoluted, but let's see if we can simplify further.Let me denote sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)) as some term, say, let‚Äôs call it k for simplicity.Let k = sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤))Then, sin C becomes:a / [2R sqrt(Œª¬≤ + 1 - 2Œª k)]But k itself is sqrt(1 - a¬≤/(4R¬≤)), so maybe we can express it differently.Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.Wait, let me think. Since I have the ratio of sides b:c = Œª, and I know side a, and the circumradius R, maybe I can use the formula for the area of the triangle in two different ways.The area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), and also as (1/2)ab sin C, etc. But I'm not sure if that would help directly.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines on angle A, since I know side a and can express sides b and c in terms of Œª.So, from the Law of Cosines:[a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A]But since b = Œªc, substitute:[a^2 = (lambda c)^2 + c^2 - 2 (lambda c) c cos A = lambda^2 c^2 + c^2 - 2 lambda c^2 cos A]Factor out c¬≤:[a^2 = c^2 (lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda cos A)]So,[c^2 = frac{a^2}{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda cos A}]Therefore,[c = frac{a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda cos A}}]And since b = Œªc,[b = frac{lambda a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda cos A}}]Okay, so now I have expressions for sides b and c in terms of a, Œª, and cos A.But I already have sin A from earlier:[sin A = frac{a}{2R}]So, cos A can be found as:[cos A = sqrt{1 - sin^2 A} = sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }]Therefore, plugging this back into the expression for c:[c = frac{a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]And similarly for b:[b = frac{lambda a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but it's an expression for sides b and c in terms of a, Œª, and R.Now, to find the angles, I can use the Law of Sines again. Since I have sides b and c, I can find angles B and C.From the Law of Sines:[frac{b}{sin B} = 2R implies sin B = frac{b}{2R}][frac{c}{sin C} = 2R implies sin C = frac{c}{2R}]So, once I have b and c, I can compute sin B and sin C, and then find angles B and C.But wait, since I already have expressions for b and c, maybe I can express sin B and sin C in terms of a, Œª, and R.Let me try that.From earlier, we have:[b = frac{lambda a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]So,[sin B = frac{b}{2R} = frac{lambda a}{2R sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]Similarly,[sin C = frac{c}{2R} = frac{a}{2R sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]So, angles B and C can be found by taking the arcsin of these expressions.But these expressions are quite complex. Maybe there's a way to simplify them further or express them in a more manageable form.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that angles B and C are related through the ratio of their sines, which is Œª.Wait, from earlier, we have:[frac{sin B}{sin C} = lambda]So, if I let sin C = x, then sin B = Œªx.But since A + B + C = 180¬∞, and I know sin A, I can perhaps relate these angles.Alternatively, maybe using the tangent of angles B and C.Wait, from earlier, we had:[cot C = frac{lambda - cos A}{sin A}]Which can be rewritten as:[tan C = frac{sin A}{lambda - cos A}]So, angle C can be found as:[C = arctanleft( frac{sin A}{lambda - cos A} right)]Similarly, since B = 180¬∞ - A - C, once we have C, we can find B.So, let's try that approach.Given that:[sin A = frac{a}{2R}][cos A = sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }]So,[tan C = frac{frac{a}{2R}}{lambda - sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}]Therefore,[C = arctanleft( frac{frac{a}{2R}}{lambda - sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }} right)]And then,[B = 180¬∞ - A - C]Where A can be found as:[A = arcsinleft( frac{a}{2R} right)]So, putting it all together, we can find angles A, B, and C, and sides b and c.But let me check if this makes sense.Suppose I have specific values for a, R, and Œª, can I compute these?For example, let's say a = 2, R = 1, and Œª = 1 (so sides b and c are equal). Then, sin A = 2/(2*1) = 1, so A = 90¬∞, which makes sense. Then, cos A = 0, so tan C = (1)/(1 - 0) = 1, so C = 45¬∞, and B = 45¬∞, which is correct for an isosceles right triangle.Another example: a = ‚àö3, R = 1, Œª = 1. Then, sin A = ‚àö3/(2*1) = ‚àö3/2, so A = 60¬∞, cos A = 1/2. Then, tan C = (‚àö3/2)/(1 - 1/2) = (‚àö3/2)/(1/2) = ‚àö3, so C = 60¬∞, and B = 60¬∞, which makes sense for an equilateral triangle.Wait, but in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so Œª should be 1, which it is. So, that checks out.Another test case: a = 1, R = 1, Œª = 1. Then, sin A = 1/2, so A = 30¬∞, cos A = ‚àö3/2. Then, tan C = (1/2)/(1 - ‚àö3/2) = (1/2)/( (2 - ‚àö3)/2 ) = 1/(2 - ‚àö3) = (2 + ‚àö3)/ (4 - 3) = 2 + ‚àö3. So, C = arctan(2 + ‚àö3) = 75¬∞, and B = 180 - 30 - 75 = 75¬∞, which is correct for a triangle with sides 1, 1, 1 (but wait, no, sides are a=1, b=1, c=1, but in this case, since Œª=1, it's equilateral, but with a=1, R=1, which actually doesn't hold because in an equilateral triangle, R = a / ‚àö3, so if a=1, R=1/‚àö3 ‚âà 0.577, not 1. So, my test case is invalid because if a=1 and R=1, it's not an equilateral triangle.Wait, so maybe I need to adjust my test case.Let me choose a=2, R=1, Œª=1. Then, sin A=1, A=90¬∞, which is a right triangle, and sides b=c=‚àö(a¬≤/2)=‚àö2, but wait, in a right triangle with hypotenuse 2, the other sides would be ‚àö(2¬≤ - (‚àö2)¬≤)=‚àö(4-2)=‚àö2, so yes, sides are 2, ‚àö2, ‚àö2, which is correct.So, that seems to work.Another test case: a=2, R=1, Œª=‚àö3.Then, sin A=1, A=90¬∞, cos A=0.tan C = (1)/(‚àö3 - 0) = 1/‚àö3, so C=30¬∞, B=60¬∞, sides b=‚àö3, c=1.Wait, but in this case, sides would be a=2, b=‚àö3, c=1, which is a 30-60-90 triangle, which is correct.So, the formulas seem to hold in these cases.Therefore, I think the approach is correct.So, summarizing the steps:1. Use the Law of Sines to find sin A = a/(2R), hence A = arcsin(a/(2R)).2. Compute cos A = sqrt(1 - (a/(2R))¬≤).3. Use the ratio b/c = Œª to express b = Œªc.4. Use the Law of Cosines to relate a, b, c, and angle A, leading to an expression for c in terms of a, Œª, and cos A.5. Substitute cos A from step 2 into the expression for c.6. Use the Law of Sines again to find sin B and sin C, leading to expressions for angles B and C.Alternatively, use the relationship between cot C and the given ratio to find angle C, then angle B.Either way, the key is to express sides b and c in terms of a, Œª, and R, and then use the Law of Sines or other trigonometric identities to find the angles.So, the final expressions for sides b and c are:[c = frac{a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}][b = frac{lambda a}{sqrt{lambda^2 + 1 - 2 lambda sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }}}]And the angles can be found using:[A = arcsinleft( frac{a}{2R} right)][C = arctanleft( frac{frac{a}{2R}}{lambda - sqrt{1 - left( frac{a}{2R} right)^2 }} right)][B = 180¬∞ - A - C]These expressions give the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles in terms of the given parameters: a, R, and Œª."},{"question":"Given that P_1(x_1, y_1) and P_2(x_2, y_2) are two points on a unit circle with center at the origin O, and angle P_1OP_2 = theta (theta is an obtuse angle).

Let me try to understand what it's asking. We have points P‚ÇÅ(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and P‚ÇÇ(x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ) on a unit circle centered at the origin O. The angle between them, ‚à†P‚ÇÅOP‚ÇÇ, is Œ∏, and it's an obtuse angle. That means Œ∏ is between 90 degrees and 180 degrees, or in radians, between œÄ/2 and œÄ. We're given that sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = 3/5. The question is asking for the value of x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ. Hmm, that expression looks familiar. I think that's the dot product of the vectors OP‚ÇÅ and OP‚ÇÇ. Since both points are on the unit circle, their magnitudes are 1, right? So the dot product should be equal to the cosine of the angle between them, which is Œ∏. So, x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ = cosŒ∏.Alright, so I need to find cosŒ∏. I know that sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = 3/5. Since Œ∏ is obtuse, Œ∏ + œÄ/4 must be in which quadrant? Let's see, Œ∏ is between œÄ/2 and œÄ, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between 3œÄ/4 and 5œÄ/4. That means Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is in the second or third quadrant. But sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) is positive, which is 3/5, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 must be in the second quadrant because sine is positive there. So, Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. Wait, but Œ∏ is already between œÄ/2 and œÄ, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between 3œÄ/4 and 5œÄ/4. But since sin is positive, it must be between œÄ/2 and œÄ, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. That means Œ∏ is between œÄ/2 - œÄ/4 and œÄ - œÄ/4, which is œÄ/4 and 3œÄ/4. But Œ∏ is given as obtuse, so Œ∏ is between œÄ/2 and œÄ, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between 3œÄ/4 and 5œÄ/4. But wait, sin is positive in the second quadrant, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 must be between œÄ/2 and œÄ, but Œ∏ is already between œÄ/2 and œÄ, so Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between 3œÄ/4 and 5œÄ/4. But 5œÄ/4 is more than œÄ, so actually, Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is in the second or third quadrant. Since sin is positive, it's in the second quadrant. So Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. Therefore, Œ∏ is between œÄ/2 - œÄ/4 = œÄ/4 and œÄ - œÄ/4 = 3œÄ/4. But Œ∏ is obtuse, so Œ∏ is between œÄ/2 and œÄ, which is consistent. So, we can find cos(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) using the Pythagorean identity. Since sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = 3/5, and Œ∏ + œÄ/4 is in the second quadrant, cos(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) will be negative. So, cos¬≤(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = 1 - sin¬≤(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = 1 - (9/25) = 16/25. Therefore, cos(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) = -4/5 because it's in the second quadrant.Now, I need to find cosŒ∏. I can use the angle subtraction formula because Œ∏ = (Œ∏ + œÄ/4) - œÄ/4. So, cosŒ∏ = cos[(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) - œÄ/4] = cos(Œ∏ + œÄ/4)cos(œÄ/4) + sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4)sin(œÄ/4).I know that cos(œÄ/4) = sin(œÄ/4) = ‚àö2/2. So plugging in the values:cosŒ∏ = (-4/5)(‚àö2/2) + (3/5)(‚àö2/2) = [(-4 + 3)/5] * ‚àö2/2 = (-1/5)(‚àö2/2) = -‚àö2/10.So, x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ = cosŒ∏ = -‚àö2/10.Wait, let me double-check my steps. I used the angle subtraction formula correctly, right? Yes, cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So, A is Œ∏ + œÄ/4, and B is œÄ/4. So, cos[(Œ∏ + œÄ/4) - œÄ/4] = cos(Œ∏ + œÄ/4)cos(œÄ/4) + sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/4)sin(œÄ/4). That seems correct.Calculating each term: (-4/5)(‚àö2/2) = (-4‚àö2)/10, and (3/5)(‚àö2/2) = (3‚àö2)/10. Adding them together: (-4‚àö2 + 3‚àö2)/10 = (-‚àö2)/10. Yep, that looks right.So, the value of x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ + y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ is -‚àö2/10. Looking at the options, that's option C."},{"question":"Given the set M={x|xleq 6}, and a= sqrt{5}, which of the following statements is correct? („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: {a} subseteq MB: a subseteq MC: {a} in MD: a notin M","answer":"Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.The set M is defined as all x such that x is less than or equal to 6. So, M = {x | x ‚â§ 6}. Okay, that means M includes every number from negative infinity up to 6, right? So, any number that's 6 or smaller is in M.Then, they give me a = ‚àö5. Hmm, ‚àö5 is approximately 2.236, right? Yeah, because 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9, so ‚àö5 is somewhere in between. So, a is about 2.236.Now, the question is asking which of the statements A, B, C, or D is correct. Let's look at each option one by one.Option A says {a} is a subset of M. Okay, so {a} is a set containing just the element a, which is ‚àö5. For {a} to be a subset of M, every element in {a} must also be in M. Since a is ‚àö5, which is approximately 2.236, and 2.236 is definitely less than 6, that means a is in M. Therefore, {a} is a subset of M. That seems correct.Option B says a is a subset of M. Wait, a is just a number, right? ‚àö5 is a single element, not a set. In set theory, when we talk about subsets, we're talking about one set being entirely contained within another set. But here, a is an element, not a set. So, saying a is a subset of M doesn't make sense because a isn't a set. It should say a is an element of M, not a subset. So, I think B is incorrect.Option C says {a} is an element of M. Hmm, {a} is a set containing a. For {a} to be an element of M, the set {a} itself would have to be in M. But M is a set of numbers, not sets. So, M contains numbers like 1, 2, 3, up to 6, but it doesn't contain sets like {a}. Therefore, {a} is not an element of M. So, C is incorrect.Option D says a is not in M. Well, we already determined that a is ‚àö5, which is about 2.236, and since 2.236 is less than 6, a is indeed in M. So, saying a is not in M is false. Therefore, D is incorrect.So, going back through the options, A is correct because {a} is a subset of M. B is incorrect because a is an element, not a subset. C is incorrect because {a} is not an element of M. D is incorrect because a is in M.I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check. If M is all numbers less than or equal to 6, then any number less than or equal to 6 is in M. Since ‚àö5 is less than 6, it's in M. So, the set containing ‚àö5 is a subset of M because all its elements (just ‚àö5) are in M. Yeah, that seems right.I guess the key here was understanding the difference between elements and subsets. A subset is a set where all its elements are in the original set, while an element is just a single member. So, since a is an element, {a} is a subset, but a itself isn't a subset. Also, {a} isn't an element because M only contains numbers, not sets.Yeah, I think I got it. So, the correct answer should be A."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and acos B=(3c-b)cos A.(1) Find sin A;(2) If a=2 sqrt{2}, and the area of triangle ABC is sqrt{2}, find the value of b+c.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle ABC, and the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. The problem gives me an equation: a cos B equals (3c - b) cos A. I need to find sin A for part (1) and then, given that a is 2‚àö2 and the area is ‚àö2, find the value of b + c for part (2).Starting with part (1). Hmm, I remember in triangles, there are laws like the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines that relate sides and angles. Maybe I can use one of those here.The given equation is a cos B = (3c - b) cos A. I wonder if I can express cos A and cos B in terms of the sides using the Law of Cosines. Let me recall that:cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤) / (2bc)cos B = (a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤) / (2ac)So, substituting these into the equation:a * [(a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤) / (2ac)] = (3c - b) * [(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤) / (2bc)]Let me simplify both sides. On the left side, the a in the numerator cancels with the a in the denominator:Left side: [ (a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤) ] / (2c)Right side: (3c - b) * [ (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤) ] / (2bc)So, now the equation is:(a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(2c) = (3c - b)(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2bc)I can multiply both sides by 2bc to eliminate the denominators:b(a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤) = (3c - b)(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)Let me expand both sides:Left side: b(a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤) = a¬≤b + bc¬≤ - b¬≥Right side: (3c - b)(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤) = 3c(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤) - b(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)= 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - b¬≥ - bc¬≤ + a¬≤bSo, putting it all together:Left side: a¬≤b + bc¬≤ - b¬≥Right side: 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - b¬≥ - bc¬≤ + a¬≤bLet me write the equation:a¬≤b + bc¬≤ - b¬≥ = 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - b¬≥ - bc¬≤ + a¬≤bHmm, I can subtract a¬≤b from both sides:bc¬≤ - b¬≥ = 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - b¬≥ - bc¬≤Also, the -b¬≥ cancels out on both sides:bc¬≤ = 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - bc¬≤Bring all terms to the left side:bc¬≤ + bc¬≤ - 3cb¬≤ - 3c¬≥ + 3c a¬≤ = 0Simplify:2bc¬≤ - 3cb¬≤ - 3c¬≥ + 3c a¬≤ = 0Factor out c:c(2b¬≤ - 3b¬≤ - 3c¬≤ + 3a¬≤) = 0Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me do that step again.Starting from:bc¬≤ - b¬≥ = 3cb¬≤ + 3c¬≥ - 3c a¬≤ - b¬≥ - bc¬≤Subtract right side from both sides:bc¬≤ - b¬≥ - 3cb¬≤ - 3c¬≥ + 3c a¬≤ + b¬≥ + bc¬≤ = 0Simplify:bc¬≤ + bc¬≤ - 3cb¬≤ - 3c¬≥ + 3c a¬≤ = 0So, 2bc¬≤ - 3cb¬≤ - 3c¬≥ + 3c a¬≤ = 0Factor out c:c(2b¬≤ - 3b¬≤ - 3c¬≤ + 3a¬≤) = 0Wait, that's c(-b¬≤ - 3c¬≤ + 3a¬≤) = 0So, since c ‚â† 0 (it's a side length), we have:-b¬≤ - 3c¬≤ + 3a¬≤ = 0Which simplifies to:3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤Hmm, that's an equation relating a, b, and c.But I need to find sin A. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines here. The Law of Sines says that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the circumradius.Let me denote k = 2R, so a = k sin A, b = k sin B, c = k sin C.So, substituting into the equation 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤:3(k sin A)¬≤ = (k sin B)¬≤ + 3(k sin C)¬≤Divide both sides by k¬≤:3 sin¬≤ A = sin¬≤ B + 3 sin¬≤ CHmm, I wonder if I can relate angles A, B, and C. Since in a triangle, A + B + C = œÄ, so C = œÄ - A - B.So, sin C = sin(œÄ - A - B) = sin(A + B)Using the sine addition formula:sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin BSo, sin¬≤ C = [sin A cos B + cos A sin B]^2Expanding that:sin¬≤ A cos¬≤ B + 2 sin A cos B cos A sin B + cos¬≤ A sin¬≤ BSo, going back to the equation:3 sin¬≤ A = sin¬≤ B + 3[sin¬≤ A cos¬≤ B + 2 sin A cos B cos A sin B + cos¬≤ A sin¬≤ B]This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Wait, going back to the original equation: a cos B = (3c - b) cos A.Maybe instead of substituting cosines, I can use the projection formula. In a triangle, the projection of side a onto side b is equal to c cos B, and similarly, the projection of side c onto side a is b cos A.But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can express cos A and cos B in terms of sides and substitute.Wait, let me try another approach. Let's divide both sides of the original equation by a:cos B = (3c - b) (cos A)/aBut from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.So, substituting:cos B = (3*(2R sin C) - 2R sin B) * (cos A)/(2R sin A)Simplify:cos B = [6R sin C - 2R sin B] * (cos A)/(2R sin A)The R cancels:cos B = [6 sin C - 2 sin B] * (cos A)/(2 sin A)Simplify numerator:6 sin C - 2 sin B = 2(3 sin C - sin B)So,cos B = [2(3 sin C - sin B)] * (cos A)/(2 sin A) = (3 sin C - sin B) * (cos A)/sin ASo,cos B = (3 sin C - sin B) * (cos A)/sin AHmm, so we have:cos B = (3 sin C - sin B) * (cos A)/sin ABut from the Law of Sines, sin A / a = sin B / b = sin C / c = 1/(2R)So, sin A = a/(2R), sin B = b/(2R), sin C = c/(2R)So, 3 sin C - sin B = 3*(c/(2R)) - b/(2R) = (3c - b)/(2R)Similarly, cos A / sin A = cot ASo, putting it all together:cos B = (3c - b)/(2R) * cot ABut from the original equation, a cos B = (3c - b) cos ASo, substituting cos B from above:a * [(3c - b)/(2R) * cot A] = (3c - b) cos ADivide both sides by (3c - b):a/(2R) * cot A = cos ABut a/(2R) is sin A, from the Law of Sines.So,sin A * cot A = cos AWhich is:sin A * (cos A / sin A) = cos AWhich simplifies to cos A = cos AHmm, that's an identity, which doesn't give me new information. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.Let me go back to the equation I had earlier: 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤So, 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤I need to find sin A. Maybe I can express sin A in terms of sides.From the Law of Sines, sin A = a/(2R). But I don't know R.Alternatively, from the area formula: Area = (1/2)ab sin C, but I don't know the area yet.Wait, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on angle A.From the Law of Cosines:cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2bc)From the equation 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, let's solve for a¬≤:a¬≤ = (b¬≤ + 3c¬≤)/3Substitute into cos A:cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - (b¬≤ + 3c¬≤)/3 ) / (2bc)Simplify numerator:= [ (3b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ - b¬≤ - 3c¬≤ ) / 3 ] / (2bc)= [ (2b¬≤) / 3 ] / (2bc)= (2b¬≤)/(3) * 1/(2bc)= b/(3c)So, cos A = b/(3c)Therefore, sin A = sqrt(1 - (b¬≤)/(9c¬≤)) = sqrt( (9c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(9c¬≤) ) = sqrt(9c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(3c)But I need to find sin A, so I need to express this in terms of known quantities or find a relationship between b and c.Wait, from the equation 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, and from the Law of Cosines, we have:a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos ABut we also have a¬≤ = (b¬≤ + 3c¬≤)/3So, equate the two expressions for a¬≤:(b¬≤ + 3c¬≤)/3 = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos AMultiply both sides by 3:b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ = 3b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ - 6bc cos ASubtract b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ from both sides:0 = 2b¬≤ - 6bc cos ADivide both sides by 2b (assuming b ‚â† 0):0 = b - 3c cos ASo,b = 3c cos ABut earlier, we found that cos A = b/(3c), so substituting:b = 3c*(b/(3c)) = bWhich is an identity, so no new information.Hmm, maybe I need to find another relationship.Wait, from the equation 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, and from the Law of Cosines, a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A.So, substituting a¬≤ into 3a¬≤:3(b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A) = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤Expand:3b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ - 6bc cos A = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤Subtract b¬≤ + 3c¬≤ from both sides:2b¬≤ - 6bc cos A = 0Divide by 2b:b - 3c cos A = 0So, again, b = 3c cos AWhich is consistent with what we had before.So, cos A = b/(3c)Therefore, sin A = sqrt(1 - (b¬≤)/(9c¬≤)) = sqrt( (9c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(9c¬≤) ) = sqrt(9c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(3c)But I still need to find sin A. Maybe I can express 9c¬≤ - b¬≤ in terms of a¬≤.From 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, rearrange:9c¬≤ - b¬≤ = 9c¬≤ - (3a¬≤ - 3c¬≤) = 9c¬≤ - 3a¬≤ + 3c¬≤ = 12c¬≤ - 3a¬≤Wait, that seems messy. Alternatively, from 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, so 9c¬≤ - b¬≤ = 9c¬≤ - (3a¬≤ - 3c¬≤) = 9c¬≤ - 3a¬≤ + 3c¬≤ = 12c¬≤ - 3a¬≤Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can express sin A in terms of sides.From the Law of Sines, sin A / a = sin B / b = sin C / cBut I don't know sin B or sin C.Alternatively, maybe I can use the area formula. Wait, for part (2), the area is given, but for part (1), I don't have specific values yet.Wait, maybe I can assume some variable substitution.Let me let k = b/c, so b = kc.Then, from cos A = b/(3c) = k/3So, cos A = k/3, so sin A = sqrt(1 - k¬≤/9)From the equation 3a¬≤ = b¬≤ + 3c¬≤, substituting b = kc:3a¬≤ = (k¬≤c¬≤) + 3c¬≤ = c¬≤(k¬≤ + 3)So, a¬≤ = c¬≤(k¬≤ + 3)/3From the Law of Cosines, a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos A = k¬≤c¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2kc¬≤*(k/3) = c¬≤(k¬≤ + 1 - (2k¬≤)/3) = c¬≤(k¬≤ + 1 - (2k¬≤)/3) = c¬≤(1 + k¬≤/3)So, from both expressions for a¬≤:c¬≤(k¬≤ + 3)/3 = c¬≤(1 + k¬≤/3)Divide both sides by c¬≤:(k¬≤ + 3)/3 = 1 + k¬≤/3Multiply both sides by 3:k¬≤ + 3 = 3 + k¬≤Which is an identity, so again, no new information.Hmm, this seems like I'm going in circles. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Wait, going back to the original equation: a cos B = (3c - b) cos AFrom the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin CSo, substituting:2R sin A cos B = (3*2R sin C - 2R sin B) cos ADivide both sides by 2R:sin A cos B = (3 sin C - sin B) cos ASo,sin A cos B = 3 sin C cos A - sin B cos ABring all terms to one side:sin A cos B + sin B cos A - 3 sin C cos A = 0Notice that sin A cos B + sin B cos A = sin(A + B) = sin(œÄ - C) = sin CSo,sin C - 3 sin C cos A = 0Factor out sin C:sin C (1 - 3 cos A) = 0Since sin C ‚â† 0 (because C is an angle in a triangle, so 0 < C < œÄ), we have:1 - 3 cos A = 0So,cos A = 1/3Therefore, sin A = sqrt(1 - (1/3)¬≤) = sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = 2‚àö2 / 3Okay, that makes sense. So, sin A is 2‚àö2 / 3.Now, moving on to part (2). Given that a = 2‚àö2 and the area is ‚àö2, find b + c.First, recall that the area of a triangle can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, we can use (1/2)bc sin A.Given that area = ‚àö2, and sin A = 2‚àö2 / 3, we have:‚àö2 = (1/2) * b * c * (2‚àö2 / 3)Simplify:‚àö2 = (1/2) * b * c * (2‚àö2 / 3) = (b c ‚àö2) / 3Multiply both sides by 3:3‚àö2 = b c ‚àö2Divide both sides by ‚àö2:3 = b cSo, bc = 3.Now, from part (1), we have cos A = 1/3, and a = 2‚àö2.Using the Law of Cosines:a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2bc cos ASubstitute the known values:(2‚àö2)¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2*3*(1/3)Simplify:8 = b¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2So,b¬≤ + c¬≤ = 10We need to find b + c. Let me denote S = b + c and P = bc = 3.We know that (b + c)¬≤ = b¬≤ + 2bc + c¬≤So,S¬≤ = (b¬≤ + c¬≤) + 2bc = 10 + 2*3 = 16Therefore, S = sqrt(16) = 4Since sides are positive, b + c = 4.So, the value of b + c is 4."},{"question":"In a population of 100 individuals numbered from 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, 99, they are evenly divided into 10 groups.

If the number drawn from the 6th group is 52, then m is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: 6  B: 7  C: 8  D: 9","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about systematic sampling, and I need to figure out the value of m. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, there are 100 individuals numbered from 0 to 99. They are evenly divided into 10 groups. That means each group has 10 individuals. So, the first group is 0-9, the second group is 10-19, and so on up to the tenth group, which is 90-99.The task is to draw a sample of size 10 using systematic sampling. The rule given is: if the number drawn randomly from the first group (0-9) is m, then the numbers drawn from the subsequent groups are obtained by sequentially offsetting. Specifically, the unit digit of the number drawn from the k-th group is either m + k - 1 or m + k - 11 (if m + k >= 11). We are told that the number drawn from the 6th group is 52, and we need to find m. The options are A: 6, B: 7, C: 8, D: 9.Alright, let's break this down. First, since the 6th group is 50-59, and the number drawn is 52, the unit digit is 2. So, according to the rule, the unit digit for the 6th group should be either m + 6 - 1 or m + 6 - 11. Let me write that down:Unit digit for 6th group = m + 6 - 1 or m + 6 - 11Simplify that:First option: m + 5Second option: m - 5But the unit digit is 2, so:Either m + 5 = 2 or m - 5 = 2Wait, hold on. If m + 5 = 2, then m would be negative, which doesn't make sense because m is a digit from 0 to 9. So, that can't be the case. Therefore, the second option must be true:m - 5 = 2So, solving for m:m = 2 + 5m = 7So, m is 7. Let me check if this makes sense.If m is 7, then the first number drawn is 7. Then, for the second group, the unit digit would be 7 + 2 - 1 = 8, so the number is 18. For the third group, unit digit is 7 + 3 - 1 = 9, so 29. Fourth group: 7 + 4 - 1 = 10, but since we're dealing with unit digits, 10 mod 10 is 0, so the number is 30. Fifth group: 7 + 5 - 1 = 11, which is 1 mod 10, so 41. Sixth group: 7 + 6 - 1 = 12, which is 2 mod 10, so 52. That matches the given number. Wait, but hold on, the rule says if m + k >= 11, then we subtract 11. So, for the sixth group, m + k = 7 + 6 = 13, which is >=11, so we subtract 11: 13 - 11 = 2. So, unit digit is 2, which is correct.Let me verify the other groups as well to make sure.First group: m = 7, so 7.Second group: m + 2 -1 = 8, so 18.Third group: m + 3 -1 = 9, so 29.Fourth group: m + 4 -1 = 10, which is 0 mod 10, so 30.Fifth group: m + 5 -1 = 11, which is 1 mod 10, so 41.Sixth group: m + 6 -1 = 12, which is 2 mod 10, so 52.Seventh group: m + 7 -1 = 13, which is 3 mod 10, so 63.Eighth group: m + 8 -1 = 14, which is 4 mod 10, so 74.Ninth group: m + 9 -1 = 15, which is 5 mod 10, so 85.Tenth group: m + 10 -1 = 16, which is 6 mod 10, so 96.Wait, but the tenth group is 90-99, so 96 is correct.But let me check if the rule applies correctly. For the fourth group, m + k = 7 + 4 = 11, which is >=11, so we subtract 11: 11 -11 = 0, so unit digit 0, which is correct.Similarly, fifth group: m + k = 7 +5 =12, subtract 11: 1, so unit digit 1, correct.Sixth group: 7 +6=13, subtract 11:2, correct.Seventh group:7 +7=14, subtract11:3, correct.Eighth group:7 +8=15, subtract11:4, correct.Ninth group:7 +9=16, subtract11:5, correct.Tenth group:7 +10=17, subtract11:6, correct.So, all the numbers are correctly generated with m=7.Therefore, the answer is B:7.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"find ‚àö ? / 13 = 4 ?","answer":"First, I need to solve the equation ‚àö? / 13 = 4.

I need to find sinŒ±, cosŒ±, and tanŒ±. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with angles and their terminal sides, the coordinates of the point on the terminal side can be used to find the trigonometric functions. Specifically, if a point (x, y) is on the terminal side of an angle, then sinŒ± = y/r, cosŒ± = x/r, and tanŒ± = y/x, where r is the distance from the origin to the point, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: r = sqrt(x¬≤ + y¬≤).So, in this case, the point is (4 sinŒ∏, -3 sinŒ∏). Let me note that down:x = 4 sinŒ∏y = -3 sinŒ∏Now, I need to find r. Let's compute that:r = sqrt(x¬≤ + y¬≤) = sqrt((4 sinŒ∏)¬≤ + (-3 sinŒ∏)¬≤) = sqrt(16 sin¬≤Œ∏ + 9 sin¬≤Œ∏) = sqrt(25 sin¬≤Œ∏) = 5 |sinŒ∏|Wait, so r is 5 times the absolute value of sinŒ∏. But Œ∏ is between œÄ and 3œÄ/2, which is the third quadrant. In the third quadrant, sinŒ∏ is negative, right? Because in the unit circle, sine corresponds to the y-coordinate, which is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. So, sinŒ∏ is negative here. Therefore, |sinŒ∏| = -sinŒ∏ because sinŒ∏ is negative. So, r = 5 * (-sinŒ∏) = -5 sinŒ∏.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me think. If sinŒ∏ is negative, then |sinŒ∏| is equal to -sinŒ∏ because sinŒ∏ is negative. So, yes, r = 5 * |sinŒ∏| = 5 * (-sinŒ∏) = -5 sinŒ∏. But r is a distance, so it should be positive. Hmm, so maybe I need to be careful here.Wait, actually, r is always positive because it's a distance. So, regardless of the sign of sinŒ∏, r is 5 |sinŒ∏|. Since sinŒ∏ is negative in the third quadrant, |sinŒ∏| = -sinŒ∏, so r = 5 * (-sinŒ∏). But since r is positive, and sinŒ∏ is negative, 5 * (-sinŒ∏) is positive because multiplying two negatives gives a positive. So, that makes sense.So, r = 5 |sinŒ∏| = 5 * (-sinŒ∏) because sinŒ∏ is negative. So, r = -5 sinŒ∏.Okay, moving on. Now, let's find sinŒ±. sinŒ± is y/r, which is (-3 sinŒ∏) / r. But we already have r as -5 sinŒ∏, so substituting that in:sinŒ± = (-3 sinŒ∏) / (-5 sinŒ∏) = ( -3 sinŒ∏ ) / ( -5 sinŒ∏ )Hmm, the sinŒ∏ terms are in both numerator and denominator, and since sinŒ∏ is not zero (because Œ∏ is between œÄ and 3œÄ/2, so sinŒ∏ is negative but not zero), we can cancel sinŒ∏:sinŒ± = (-3) / (-5) = 3/5So, sinŒ± is 3/5. That seems straightforward.Next, let's find cosŒ±. cosŒ± is x/r, which is (4 sinŒ∏) / r. Again, r is -5 sinŒ∏, so:cosŒ± = (4 sinŒ∏) / (-5 sinŒ∏) = 4 / (-5) = -4/5So, cosŒ± is -4/5.Now, tanŒ± is sinŒ± / cosŒ±, which is (3/5) / (-4/5) = (3/5) * (-5/4) = -15/20 = -3/4Alternatively, tanŒ± can also be calculated as y/x, which is (-3 sinŒ∏) / (4 sinŒ∏) = (-3)/4 = -3/4. So, same result.Wait, let me double-check that. If I compute tanŒ± as y/x, that's (-3 sinŒ∏)/(4 sinŒ∏). The sinŒ∏ cancels out, giving -3/4. Yep, that matches.So, summarizing:sinŒ± = 3/5cosŒ± = -4/5tanŒ± = -3/4But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the signs. The point (4 sinŒ∏, -3 sinŒ∏). Since Œ∏ is in the third quadrant, sinŒ∏ is negative, so 4 sinŒ∏ is negative, and -3 sinŒ∏ is positive because sinŒ∏ is negative, so negative times negative is positive.Wait, so x = 4 sinŒ∏ is negative, and y = -3 sinŒ∏ is positive. So, the point (x, y) is in the second quadrant because x is negative and y is positive. But earlier, I thought Œ∏ is in the third quadrant, so sinŒ∏ is negative. But the point (x, y) is in the second quadrant. Is that correct?Let me think. Œ∏ is between œÄ and 3œÄ/2, which is the third quadrant. So, sinŒ∏ is negative, cosŒ∏ is negative as well. But the point given is (4 sinŒ∏, -3 sinŒ∏). So, x = 4 sinŒ∏, which is negative because sinŒ∏ is negative. y = -3 sinŒ∏, which is positive because sinŒ∏ is negative. So, the point is in the second quadrant.But angle Œ± is the angle whose terminal side passes through this point. So, Œ± is in the second quadrant. Therefore, sinŒ± is positive, cosŒ± is negative, and tanŒ± is negative, which matches our results: sinŒ± = 3/5 (positive), cosŒ± = -4/5 (negative), tanŒ± = -3/4 (negative). So, that seems consistent.Wait, but in the initial calculation, I thought Œ∏ is in the third quadrant, but the point is in the second quadrant. So, angle Œ± is in the second quadrant. So, that's correct.But let me just make sure about the value of r. Since r is the distance, it's always positive, so r = 5 |sinŒ∏|. Since sinŒ∏ is negative, |sinŒ∏| = -sinŒ∏, so r = 5*(-sinŒ∏). But since r is positive, and sinŒ∏ is negative, that's okay.Wait, but if I write r = 5 |sinŒ∏|, and sinŒ∏ is negative, then r = 5*(-sinŒ∏). So, r is positive.So, when I calculated sinŒ± = y/r = (-3 sinŒ∏)/(-5 sinŒ∏) = 3/5, that's correct.Similarly, cosŒ± = x/r = (4 sinŒ∏)/(-5 sinŒ∏) = -4/5.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I can think of it as the point (x, y) = (4 sinŒ∏, -3 sinŒ∏). Since sinŒ∏ is negative, let's denote sinŒ∏ = -k, where k is positive. Then, the point becomes (4*(-k), -3*(-k)) = (-4k, 3k). So, the point is (-4k, 3k), which is in the second quadrant.Then, r = sqrt((-4k)^2 + (3k)^2) = sqrt(16k¬≤ + 9k¬≤) = sqrt(25k¬≤) = 5k.So, sinŒ± = y/r = 3k / 5k = 3/5cosŒ± = x/r = (-4k)/5k = -4/5tanŒ± = y/x = 3k / (-4k) = -3/4So, same results. So, that's another way to see it, substituting sinŒ∏ = -k.Therefore, I think my calculations are correct.So, to recap:Given the point (4 sinŒ∏, -3 sinŒ∏), with Œ∏ in (œÄ, 3œÄ/2), so sinŒ∏ is negative.Expressed as (-4k, 3k) where k = -sinŒ∏, positive.r = 5ksinŒ± = 3/5cosŒ± = -4/5tanŒ± = -3/4Yes, that makes sense.I think I've covered all the steps and checked the signs carefully. So, I'm confident with these results."},{"question":"if m is an integer such that ( - 2 ) ^ 2 m = 2 ^ ( 21 - m ) then m = ?","answer":"First, I need to solve the equation ((-2)^{2m} = 2^{21 - m}) where (m) is an integer.I notice that the left side of the equation has a negative base raised to an even exponent. Since any negative number raised to an even power becomes positive, I can simplify ((-2)^{2m}) to (2^{2m}).Now, the equation becomes:[2^{2m} = 2^{21 - m}]Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:[2m = 21 - m]To solve for (m), I'll add (m) to both sides of the equation:[2m + m = 21][3m = 21]Finally, I'll divide both sides by 3 to find the value of (m):[m = frac{21}{3} = 7]"},{"question":"Given that a > 0, b > 0, and frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b} = 2.(1) Find the minimum value of ab;(2) Find the minimum value of a + 2b, and find the corresponding values of a and b.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of two different expressions given some constraints on a and b. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem states that a and b are both positive numbers, and they satisfy the equation 1/a + 2/b = 2. There are two parts: (1) finding the minimum value of ab, and (2) finding the minimum value of a + 2b along with the corresponding values of a and b.Starting with part (1), finding the minimum value of ab. Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with expressions like this, especially with reciprocals, the AM-GM inequality might come in handy. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Maybe I can apply that here.Given that 1/a + 2/b = 2, I can think of this as the sum of two terms: 1/a and 2/b. If I consider these two terms, perhaps I can apply the AM-GM inequality on them. Let me write that out:(1/a + 2/b)/2 ‚â• sqrt((1/a)*(2/b))Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:1/a + 2/b ‚â• 2*sqrt(2/(ab))But we know from the given equation that 1/a + 2/b = 2, so substituting that in:2 ‚â• 2*sqrt(2/(ab))Dividing both sides by 2:1 ‚â• sqrt(2/(ab))Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:1 ‚â• 2/(ab)Which can be rewritten as:ab ‚â• 2So, the product ab is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the minimum value of ab is 2. But wait, I should check when equality holds because that's when the minimum is achieved. For the AM-GM inequality, equality holds when all the terms are equal. So, in this case, 1/a should be equal to 2/b.Setting 1/a = 2/b, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b:1/a = 2/b ‚áí b = 2aNow, substitute b = 2a into the original equation:1/a + 2/(2a) = 2 ‚áí 1/a + 1/a = 2 ‚áí 2/a = 2 ‚áí a = 1Then, since b = 2a, b = 2*1 = 2.So, when a = 1 and b = 2, ab = 1*2 = 2, which confirms that the minimum value of ab is indeed 2.Okay, that seems solid for part (1). Now, moving on to part (2), which is to find the minimum value of a + 2b and the corresponding values of a and b.This seems a bit trickier. I need to minimize the expression a + 2b given the constraint 1/a + 2/b = 2. One approach that comes to mind is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since this is likely intended to be solved with algebraic methods, maybe I can use substitution or another inequality.Alternatively, I can express one variable in terms of the other using the given equation and then substitute it into the expression I need to minimize.Let me try that. From the equation 1/a + 2/b = 2, I can solve for one variable. Let's solve for 1/a:1/a = 2 - 2/b ‚áí a = 1/(2 - 2/b)But this might get complicated. Alternatively, let's solve for b in terms of a.Starting again:1/a + 2/b = 2 ‚áí 2/b = 2 - 1/a ‚áí 1/b = (2 - 1/a)/2 ‚áí b = 2/(2 - 1/a)Hmm, this is still a bit messy. Maybe another approach. Let me think about using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or perhaps another application of AM-GM.Wait, another idea: I can use the method of substitution by letting x = a and y = 2b. Then, the expression to minimize becomes x + y, and the constraint becomes 1/x + 1/y = 2. That might simplify things.Let me try that substitution:Let x = a and y = 2b. Then, the constraint becomes:1/x + 1/y = 2And the expression to minimize is x + y.Now, this looks more symmetric. So, we need to minimize x + y given that 1/x + 1/y = 2, with x > 0 and y > 0.This seems more manageable. Maybe I can apply the AM-HM inequality here. The harmonic mean of x and y is given by 2/(1/x + 1/y). Since 1/x + 1/y = 2, the harmonic mean is 2/2 = 1.The AM-HM inequality states that (x + y)/2 ‚â• 2/(1/x + 1/y). Substituting the harmonic mean:(x + y)/2 ‚â• 1 ‚áí x + y ‚â• 2But wait, that suggests that x + y is at least 2, but I feel like this might not be tight enough because when I plug in x = y = 1, 1/x + 1/y = 2, which satisfies the constraint, and x + y = 2. But in our original variables, x = a and y = 2b, so if x = 1, then a = 1, and y = 1 implies 2b = 1 ‚áí b = 0.5. But let's check if this satisfies the original constraint:1/a + 2/b = 1/1 + 2/(0.5) = 1 + 4 = 5, which is not equal to 2. So, something's wrong here.Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me double-check.I set x = a and y = 2b, so the constraint 1/a + 2/b = 2 becomes 1/x + 1/(y/2) = 2 ‚áí 1/x + 2/y = 2. Hmm, that's not the same as 1/x + 1/y = 2. So, my substitution was incorrect.Let me try a different substitution. Maybe express b in terms of a from the constraint and substitute into a + 2b.From 1/a + 2/b = 2, let's solve for b:2/b = 2 - 1/a ‚áí 1/b = (2 - 1/a)/2 ‚áí b = 2/(2 - 1/a)So, b = 2/(2 - 1/a). Now, substitute this into a + 2b:a + 2*(2/(2 - 1/a)) = a + 4/(2 - 1/a)Let me simplify this expression. Let me denote t = 1/a, so a = 1/t, and the expression becomes:1/t + 4/(2 - t)Now, we need to minimize this expression with respect to t, where t > 0 and 2 - t > 0 ‚áí t < 2. So, t is in (0, 2).Let me define f(t) = 1/t + 4/(2 - t). To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it equal to zero.First, compute f'(t):f'(t) = -1/t¬≤ + 4/(2 - t)¬≤Set f'(t) = 0:-1/t¬≤ + 4/(2 - t)¬≤ = 0 ‚áí 4/(2 - t)¬≤ = 1/t¬≤ ‚áí 4t¬≤ = (2 - t)¬≤Taking square roots on both sides (since both sides are positive):2t = 2 - t ‚áí 2t + t = 2 ‚áí 3t = 2 ‚áí t = 2/3So, t = 2/3. Now, check if this is a minimum by checking the second derivative or analyzing the behavior.Alternatively, since it's the only critical point in (0, 2), and f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 0 or 2, it must be a minimum.Now, compute f(2/3):f(2/3) = 1/(2/3) + 4/(2 - 2/3) = 3/2 + 4/(4/3) = 3/2 + 4*(3/4) = 3/2 + 3 = 9/2So, the minimum value of a + 2b is 9/2.Now, find the corresponding values of a and b. Recall that t = 1/a = 2/3 ‚áí a = 3/2.Then, b = 2/(2 - t) = 2/(2 - 2/3) = 2/(4/3) = 2*(3/4) = 3/2.So, a = 3/2 and b = 3/2.Wait, let me verify this with the original constraint:1/a + 2/b = 1/(3/2) + 2/(3/2) = 2/3 + 4/3 = 6/3 = 2, which satisfies the constraint.And a + 2b = 3/2 + 2*(3/2) = 3/2 + 3 = 9/2, which matches our earlier result.So, everything checks out.Alternatively, I could have used the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since this is a problem likely intended for algebraic methods, the substitution and calculus approach worked well.Another way could be to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let me explore that.We have the expression a + 2b, and the constraint 1/a + 2/b = 2.Let me consider vectors or sequences that can be paired with Cauchy-Schwarz. Maybe pair (a, 2b) with (1, 1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of it as (a, b) and (1, 2), but I need to relate it to the constraint.Wait, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz in the form:(a + 2b)(1/a + 2/b) ‚â• (sqrt(a*(1/a)) + sqrt(2b*(2/b)))¬≤Wait, that might not be directly applicable. Let me think again.Alternatively, consider that (a + 2b)(1/a + 2/b) ‚â• (1 + 2)^2 = 9 by Cauchy-Schwarz.But (a + 2b)(1/a + 2/b) = (a + 2b)(2) = 2(a + 2b). So, 2(a + 2b) ‚â• 9 ‚áí a + 2b ‚â• 9/2.This is a much quicker way and confirms our earlier result. So, the minimum value is indeed 9/2, achieved when a = 3/2 and b = 3/2.This method is more elegant and avoids calculus, which is probably the intended approach.So, to summarize:(1) The minimum value of ab is 2, achieved when a = 1 and b = 2.(2) The minimum value of a + 2b is 9/2, achieved when a = 3/2 and b = 3/2.I think that covers both parts of the problem."},{"question":"With the number written on the board, the following operations are allowed: replacing it with its double, or erasing its last digit. How can you use these operations to get the number 14 from the number 458?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I start with the number 458, and I can either double it or erase the last digit. My goal is to get to the number 14. Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this.First, let me understand the operations better. Doubling the number seems straightforward‚Äîit just multiplies the number by 2. Erasing the last digit is like performing an integer division by 10, but without rounding. For example, if I have 458 and I erase the last digit, I get 45. If I erase the last digit of 45, I get 4.So, starting with 458, what can I do? I can either double it or erase the last digit. Let's try both options and see where they lead.Option 1: Double 458. That would give me 916. Hmm, 916 is quite a bit larger than 14. If I keep doubling, I'll just get bigger numbers, which seems counterproductive. Maybe doubling isn't the best first step.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 458 to get 45. That's a smaller number, which is closer to 14. Okay, so erasing the last digit seems like a better first move.Now, I have 45. What should I do next? Again, I can either double it or erase the last digit.Option 1: Double 45 to get 90. 90 is still larger than 14, but maybe I can work with that.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 45 to get 4. That's a small number, but I need to get to 14, which is bigger than 4. So, erasing again might not help me get closer to 14.So, let's go with doubling 45 to get 90.Now, I have 90. What's next? Again, I can double it or erase the last digit.Option 1: Double 90 to get 180. That's moving away from 14.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 90 to get 9. 9 is smaller than 14, but maybe I can work with that.So, erasing the last digit of 90 gives me 9.Now, I have 9. What can I do? Double it or erase the last digit.Option 1: Double 9 to get 18. That's closer to 14, but still not there.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 9. Wait, 9 is a single-digit number, so erasing the last digit would just give me 0, which isn't helpful.So, I should double 9 to get 18.Now, I have 18. What's next?Option 1: Double 18 to get 36.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 18 to get 1.Doubling seems better here because 36 is still on the path to 14 if I can manipulate it correctly.So, doubling 18 gives me 36.Now, I have 36. What should I do?Option 1: Double 36 to get 72.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 36 to get 3.Again, doubling seems better because 72 is still a two-digit number, and I might be able to erase a digit to get closer to 14.So, doubling 36 gives me 72.Now, I have 72. What's next?Option 1: Double 72 to get 144.Option 2: Erase the last digit of 72 to get 7.Erase the last digit to get 7 seems better because 7 is closer to 14, and I can double it to get 14.So, erasing the last digit of 72 gives me 7.Now, I have 7. What can I do?Option 1: Double 7 to get 14. That's my target!Option 2: Erase the last digit of 7, which would give me 0, not helpful.So, doubling 7 gives me 14, which is what I wanted.Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:1. Start with 458.2. Erase the last digit to get 45.3. Double 45 to get 90.4. Erase the last digit of 90 to get 9.5. Double 9 to get 18.6. Double 18 to get 36.7. Double 36 to get 72.8. Erase the last digit of 72 to get 7.9. Double 7 to get 14.Yes, that seems to work. Each step logically follows, and I end up with 14. I think this is the correct sequence of operations."},{"question":"Prove the equalities:a) (sin 15^{circ}=frac{sqrt{6}-sqrt{2}}{4}, quad cos 15^{circ}=frac{sqrt{6}+sqrt{2}}{4})b) (sin 18^{circ}=frac{-1+sqrt{5}}{4}, quad cos 18^{circ}=frac{sqrt{10+2sqrt{5}}}{4}).","answer":"Okay, so I have these two trigonometric identities to prove: a) sin 15¬∞ = (‚àö6 - ‚àö2)/4 and cos 15¬∞ = (‚àö6 + ‚àö2)/4b) sin 18¬∞ = (-1 + ‚àö5)/4 and cos 18¬∞ = ‚àö(10 + 2‚àö5)/4Hmm, starting with part a). I remember there are angle subtraction formulas in trigonometry. Maybe I can use those. Let me recall: sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin Bcos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin BYes, that seems right. So, 15¬∞ is 45¬∞ - 30¬∞, right? So maybe I can write sin 15¬∞ as sin(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) and cos 15¬∞ as cos(45¬∞ - 30¬∞). That should work.Let me try that for sin 15¬∞ first.sin(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) = sin 45¬∞ cos 30¬∞ - cos 45¬∞ sin 30¬∞I know the exact values for these:sin 45¬∞ = ‚àö2/2cos 30¬∞ = ‚àö3/2cos 45¬∞ = ‚àö2/2sin 30¬∞ = 1/2Plugging these into the formula:sin(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) = (‚àö2/2)(‚àö3/2) - (‚àö2/2)(1/2)Let me compute each term:First term: (‚àö2/2)(‚àö3/2) = (‚àö6)/4Second term: (‚àö2/2)(1/2) = ‚àö2/4So, sin(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) = (‚àö6)/4 - ‚àö2/4 = (‚àö6 - ‚àö2)/4That matches the given identity for sin 15¬∞. Great!Now, let's do the same for cos 15¬∞.cos(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) = cos 45¬∞ cos 30¬∞ + sin 45¬∞ sin 30¬∞Again, plugging in the known values:cos 45¬∞ = ‚àö2/2cos 30¬∞ = ‚àö3/2sin 45¬∞ = ‚àö2/2sin 30¬∞ = 1/2So,cos(45¬∞ - 30¬∞) = (‚àö2/2)(‚àö3/2) + (‚àö2/2)(1/2)Compute each term:First term: (‚àö2/2)(‚àö3/2) = ‚àö6/4Second term: (‚àö2/2)(1/2) = ‚àö2/4Adding them together:‚àö6/4 + ‚àö2/4 = (‚àö6 + ‚àö2)/4Perfect, that's the identity for cos 15¬∞. So part a) is done.Moving on to part b). This one seems trickier. I need to prove that sin 18¬∞ = (-1 + ‚àö5)/4 and cos 18¬∞ = ‚àö(10 + 2‚àö5)/4.I remember that 18¬∞ is related to the regular pentagon, and there are some exact expressions for sine and cosine of 18¬∞, but I'm not exactly sure how to derive them. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities or equations.Let me think. I know that 5*18¬∞ = 90¬∞, so 18¬∞ is related to 90¬∞, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can use multiple-angle formulas.Alternatively, I recall that sin 18¬∞ can be found by solving a quadratic equation. Let me try that approach.Let‚Äôs denote Œ∏ = 18¬∞. Then, 5Œ∏ = 90¬∞, so sin(5Œ∏) = sin 90¬∞ = 1.Using the multiple-angle formula for sine:sin(5Œ∏) = 16 sin^5 Œ∏ - 20 sin^3 Œ∏ + 5 sin Œ∏So, setting sin(5Œ∏) = 1:16 sin^5 Œ∏ - 20 sin^3 Œ∏ + 5 sin Œ∏ = 1Let‚Äôs let x = sin Œ∏. Then the equation becomes:16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x - 1 = 0This is a quintic equation, which is generally hard to solve, but maybe it factors.Let me try to factor it. Let's see if x = 1 is a root:16(1)^5 - 20(1)^3 + 5(1) - 1 = 16 - 20 + 5 - 1 = 0Yes, x = 1 is a root. So, (x - 1) is a factor.Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.Divide 16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x - 1 by (x - 1).Using synthetic division:Coefficients: 16, 0, -20, 0, 5, -1Bring down 16.Multiply by 1: 16Add to next coefficient: 0 + 16 = 16Multiply by 1: 16Add to next coefficient: -20 + 16 = -4Multiply by 1: -4Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-4) = -4Multiply by 1: -4Add to next coefficient: 5 + (-4) = 1Multiply by 1: 1Add to last coefficient: -1 + 1 = 0So, the polynomial factors as (x - 1)(16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1) = 0So, the equation becomes:(x - 1)(16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1) = 0We already know x = 1 is a solution, but sin 18¬∞ is not 1, so we need to solve the quartic:16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0This seems complicated, but maybe it can be factored further. Let me try to factor it.Let me attempt to factor it into two quadratics:( ax^2 + bx + c )( dx^2 + ex + f ) = 16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1Multiplying out:ad x^4 + (ae + bd) x^3 + (af + be + cd) x^2 + (bf + ce) x + cf = 16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1Matching coefficients:ad = 16ae + bd = 16af + be + cd = -4bf + ce = -4cf = 1Looking at cf = 1, possible options are c = 1, f = 1 or c = -1, f = -1.Let me try c = 1, f = 1.Then, ad = 16. Let's try a = 4, d = 4.So, a = 4, d = 4, c = 1, f = 1.Now, ae + bd = 16.With a = 4, d = 4, this becomes 4e + 4b = 16 => e + b = 4.Next, af + be + cd = -4.With a = 4, f = 1, c = 1, d = 4:4*1 + b*e + 1*4 = -4 => 4 + be + 4 = -4 => be = -12Also, bf + ce = -4.With f = 1, e = 4 - b (from e + b = 4):b*1 + c*e = b + e = b + (4 - b) = 4But this should equal -4, which is a contradiction.So, this factoring doesn't work. Maybe try different a and d.Let me try a = 8, d = 2.Then, ad = 16.ae + bd = 8e + 2b = 16.af + be + cd = 8*1 + b*e + 1*2 = 8 + be + 2 = be + 10 = -4 => be = -14bf + ce = b*1 + c*e = b + e = -4From ae + bd = 8e + 2b = 16, and b + e = -4.Let me express e = -4 - b.Substitute into 8e + 2b = 16:8*(-4 - b) + 2b = -32 - 8b + 2b = -32 - 6b = 16So, -6b = 48 => b = -8Then, e = -4 - (-8) = 4Check be = (-8)(4) = -32 ‚â† -14. Not matching.So, this doesn't work either.Maybe try a = 2, d = 8.Then, ae + bd = 2e + 8b = 16af + be + cd = 2*1 + b*e + 1*8 = 2 + be + 8 = be + 10 = -4 => be = -14bf + ce = b*1 + c*e = b + e = -4From ae + bd = 2e + 8b = 16Express e = -4 - bSubstitute into 2e + 8b = 16:2*(-4 - b) + 8b = -8 - 2b + 8b = -8 + 6b = 166b = 24 => b = 4Then, e = -4 - 4 = -8Check be = 4*(-8) = -32 ‚â† -14. Not matching.Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe try c = -1, f = -1.Then, ad = 16ae + bd = 16af + be + cd = -4bf + ce = -4cf = 1So, c = -1, f = -1.Let me try a = 4, d = 4.Then, ae + bd = 4e + 4b = 16 => e + b = 4af + be + cd = 4*(-1) + b*e + (-1)*4 = -4 + be -4 = be - 8 = -4 => be = 4bf + ce = b*(-1) + (-1)*e = -b - e = -4From e + b = 4 and -b - e = -4, which is consistent.So, we have e + b = 4 and be = 4.So, solving for b and e:Let me set b = 4 - eThen, be = (4 - e)e = 4e - e^2 = 4So, 4e - e^2 = 4 => e^2 - 4e + 4 = 0 => (e - 2)^2 = 0 => e = 2Thus, b = 4 - 2 = 2So, the factors are:(4x^2 + 2x - 1)(4x^2 + 2x - 1) = (4x^2 + 2x - 1)^2Wait, but our quartic is 16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1But (4x^2 + 2x - 1)^2 = 16x^4 + 16x^3 + (4x^2 - 8x^2) + (-4x) + 1 = 16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1Yes, that matches!So, the quartic factors as (4x^2 + 2x - 1)^2 = 0Thus, the solutions are the roots of 4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0Using quadratic formula:x = [-2 ¬± ‚àö(4 + 16)] / 8 = [-2 ¬± ‚àö20]/8 = [-2 ¬± 2‚àö5]/8 = [-1 ¬± ‚àö5]/4So, x = (-1 + ‚àö5)/4 or x = (-1 - ‚àö5)/4Since sin 18¬∞ is positive (18¬∞ is in the first quadrant), we take the positive root:sin 18¬∞ = (-1 + ‚àö5)/4Great, that's the first identity.Now, for cos 18¬∞, I can use the Pythagorean identity:sin^2 Œ∏ + cos^2 Œ∏ = 1So, cos^2 18¬∞ = 1 - sin^2 18¬∞Let me compute sin^2 18¬∞:sin 18¬∞ = (-1 + ‚àö5)/4So, sin^2 18¬∞ = [(-1 + ‚àö5)/4]^2 = (1 - 2‚àö5 + 5)/16 = (6 - 2‚àö5)/16 = (3 - ‚àö5)/8Thus, cos^2 18¬∞ = 1 - (3 - ‚àö5)/8 = (8 - 3 + ‚àö5)/8 = (5 + ‚àö5)/8Therefore, cos 18¬∞ = ‚àö[(5 + ‚àö5)/8]But the given identity is ‚àö(10 + 2‚àö5)/4. Let me see if these are equal.Compute ‚àö[(5 + ‚àö5)/8]:Multiply numerator and denominator inside the square root by 2:‚àö[(10 + 2‚àö5)/16] = ‚àö(10 + 2‚àö5)/4Yes, that's the same as the given identity.So, cos 18¬∞ = ‚àö(10 + 2‚àö5)/4Perfect, both identities are proven.**Final Answer**a) (boxed{sin 15^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}}) and (boxed{cos 15^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}})b) (boxed{sin 18^{circ} = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{4}}) and (boxed{cos 18^{circ} = frac{sqrt{10 + 2sqrt{5}}}{4}})"},{"question":"A fast-food chain offers summer jobs to students with a salary of 25,000 rubles per month.

When x is greater than or equal to zero, f(x) is given as x squared minus 2x. I need to figure out which of the statements A, B, C, or D are true. Let me go through each option one by one.First, since f(x) is even, that means f(-x) equals f(x). So, for negative x values, f(x) should be the same as f(-x), which is given by the expression for positive x. So, for x less than zero, f(x) would be (-x)^2 minus 2*(-x), which simplifies to x squared plus 2x. Got that down.Now, let's look at option A: The minimum value of f(x) is -1. Hmm, okay. For x greater than or equal to zero, f(x) is x squared minus 2x. I can rewrite this as (x - 1)^2 minus 1. That's completing the square, right? So, the minimum value of this quadratic function occurs at x = 1, and it's -1. Since the function is even, it's symmetric about the y-axis, so the minimum value on the negative side should also be -1. So, yeah, the minimum value of f(x) is indeed -1. So, A seems correct.Moving on to option B: f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-2, 0). Let's think about this. For x less than zero, f(x) is x squared plus 2x. To find if it's decreasing, I can take the derivative. The derivative of f(x) for x < 0 is 2x + 2. So, if I plug in values from (-2, 0), say x = -1, the derivative is 2*(-1) + 2 = 0. Hmm, at x = -1, the derivative is zero. For x < -1, like x = -2, the derivative is 2*(-2) + 2 = -2, which is negative. For x between -1 and 0, like x = -0.5, the derivative is 2*(-0.5) + 2 = 1, which is positive. So, the function is decreasing on (-‚àû, -1) and increasing on (-1, 0). Therefore, on the interval (-2, 0), the function isn't just decreasing; it first decreases until x = -1 and then increases. So, B is incorrect.Option C: The solution set of f(x) > 0 is (-‚àû, -2) union (2, +‚àû). Let's check this. For x >= 0, f(x) = x^2 - 2x. We can solve x^2 - 2x > 0. Factoring, x(x - 2) > 0. So, this inequality holds when x < 0 or x > 2. But since x >= 0 in this case, the solution is x > 2. For x < 0, f(x) = x^2 + 2x. Solving x^2 + 2x > 0, which factors to x(x + 2) > 0. This holds when x < -2 or x > 0. But since x < 0 here, the solution is x < -2. Combining both cases, the solution set is indeed (-‚àû, -2) union (2, +‚àû). So, C is correct.Finally, option D: There exists a real number x such that f(x + 2) + f(-x) = 0. Let's see. Since f is even, f(-x) = f(x). So, the equation becomes f(x + 2) + f(x) = 0. We need to find if there's an x where this holds. Let's consider x = 0. Then f(0 + 2) + f(0) = f(2) + f(0). f(2) is 2^2 - 2*2 = 4 - 4 = 0. f(0) is 0^2 - 2*0 = 0. So, 0 + 0 = 0. That works. So, x = 0 is a solution. Alternatively, x = -2: f(-2 + 2) + f(2) = f(0) + f(2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So, that also works. Therefore, D is correct.Wait, but I thought the function is even, so f(-x) = f(x). So, in the equation f(x + 2) + f(-x) = 0, it's equivalent to f(x + 2) + f(x) = 0. So, I need to find x such that f(x + 2) = -f(x). Let's see if that's possible.For x >= 0, f(x) = x^2 - 2x. So, f(x + 2) would be (x + 2)^2 - 2(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = x^2 + 2x. So, f(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x. Then, f(x + 2) + f(x) = (x^2 + 2x) + (x^2 - 2x) = 2x^2. So, 2x^2 = 0 implies x = 0. So, only x = 0 satisfies this for x >= 0.For x < 0, f(x) = x^2 + 2x. Then, f(x + 2) would be, since x + 2 could be positive or negative. If x + 2 >= 0, which is when x >= -2, then f(x + 2) = (x + 2)^2 - 2(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = x^2 + 2x. So, f(x + 2) + f(x) = (x^2 + 2x) + (x^2 + 2x) = 2x^2 + 4x. Setting this equal to zero: 2x^2 + 4x = 0 => 2x(x + 2) = 0 => x = 0 or x = -2. But x < 0, so x = -2 is a solution.If x + 2 < 0, which is when x < -2, then f(x + 2) = (x + 2)^2 + 2(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4 + 2x + 4 = x^2 + 6x + 8. Then, f(x + 2) + f(x) = (x^2 + 6x + 8) + (x^2 + 2x) = 2x^2 + 8x + 8. Setting this equal to zero: 2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0 => x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 => (x + 2)^2 = 0 => x = -2. But x < -2, so no solution here.So, overall, the solutions are x = 0 and x = -2. Therefore, there do exist real numbers x such that f(x + 2) + f(-x) = 0. So, D is correct.Wait, but in my initial thought, I considered x = 0 and x = -2, but when x = -2, x + 2 = 0, so f(x + 2) = f(0) = 0, and f(-x) = f(2) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0. That works. Similarly, x = 0 gives f(2) + f(0) = 0 + 0 = 0. So, yeah, D is correct.So, in summary, A, C, and D are correct, while B is incorrect."},{"question":"What is the least positive multiple of 24 that is greater than 450?","answer":"First, I need to find the smallest multiple of 24 that is greater than 450. To do this, I'll divide 450 by 24 to see how many times 24 fits into 450.Calculating ( 450 div 24 ) gives me 18 with a remainder of 18.

How many more boys are there than girls?","answer":"First, I need to understand the given ratio of boys to girls, which is 8:5. This means that for every 8 boys, there are 5 girls.Next, I know there are 30 girls at the game. To find out how many times the ratio fits into the actual number of girls, I divide the number of girls by the ratio number for girls: 30 √∑ 5 = 6.This tells me that the ratio fits 6 times into the actual number of girls. To find the number of boys, I multiply the ratio number for boys by this factor: 8 √ó 6 = 48.Finally, to determine how many more boys there are than girls, I subtract the number of girls from the number of boys: 48 - 30 = 18.Therefore, there are 18 more boys than girls at the basketball game."},{"question":"If 3x (2x+y) = 14 and y (2x+y) = 35, what is the value of (2x+y)^2?","answer":"First, I observe that both equations involve the term (2x + y).

Prove that   n  is a sum of 2 squares of positive integers, and that such   n  does exist.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to prove that if ( n > 2 ) is an integer such that ( n^2 ) can be represented as the difference of cubes of two consecutive positive integers, then ( n ) is a sum of two squares of positive integers. Additionally, I need to show that such an ( n ) does exist.First, let me parse the problem. It says that ( n^2 ) is the difference between the cubes of two consecutive integers. Let's denote these two consecutive integers as ( x ) and ( x+1 ). So, mathematically, this can be written as:[n^2 = (x+1)^3 - x^3]Okay, so I need to expand the right-hand side to see what this gives me. Let's compute ( (x+1)^3 - x^3 ):[(x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1]Subtracting ( x^3 ) from both sides:[(x+1)^3 - x^3 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1]So, we have:[n^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1]Alright, so now I have an equation relating ( n ) and ( x ). The next step is to figure out what this implies about ( n ). The problem wants me to show that ( n ) can be expressed as the sum of two squares of positive integers. I remember that numbers which can be expressed as the sum of two squares have certain properties, especially related to their prime factorization. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that a prime number ( p ) can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if ( p ) is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Moreover, any number can be expressed as the sum of two squares if in its prime factorization, every prime congruent to 3 modulo 4 appears with an even exponent.So, perhaps I need to analyze the equation ( n^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1 ) to see if ( n ) satisfies these conditions.Let me rearrange the equation:[n^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1]This is a quadratic in ( x ). Maybe I can solve for ( x ) in terms of ( n ):[3x^2 + 3x + (1 - n^2) = 0]Using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-3 pm sqrt{9 - 12(1 - n^2)}}{6}]Simplify the discriminant:[sqrt{9 - 12 + 12n^2} = sqrt{12n^2 - 3} = sqrt{3(4n^2 - 1)}]So, for ( x ) to be an integer, the discriminant must be an integer. Therefore, ( 3(4n^2 - 1) ) must be a perfect square. Let's denote:[sqrt{3(4n^2 - 1)} = k]Where ( k ) is an integer. Then:[3(4n^2 - 1) = k^2][12n^2 - 3 = k^2][k^2 = 12n^2 - 3][k^2 + 3 = 12n^2][k^2 + 3 = 12n^2]Hmm, this seems like a Pell-type equation. Pell equations are of the form ( x^2 - Dy^2 = N ). Let me see if I can rearrange the equation to resemble that.Starting from:[k^2 = 12n^2 - 3][k^2 - 12n^2 = -3]Yes, this is a Pell-type equation:[k^2 - 12n^2 = -3]I know that Pell equations have solutions that can be found using continued fractions or other methods, but I'm not too familiar with the exact process. Maybe I can find some small solutions to get a sense of what's going on.Let me try small values of ( n ) and see if ( k ) becomes an integer.For ( n = 1 ):[k^2 = 12(1)^2 - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 implies k = 3]So, ( (k, n) = (3, 1) ) is a solution.For ( n = 2 ):[k^2 = 12(4) - 3 = 48 - 3 = 45 implies k = sqrt{45} approx 6.708 ) which is not an integer.For ( n = 3 ):[k^2 = 12(9) - 3 = 108 - 3 = 105 implies k approx 10.246 ) not integer.For ( n = 4 ):[k^2 = 12(16) - 3 = 192 - 3 = 189 implies k approx 13.747 ) not integer.For ( n = 5 ):[k^2 = 12(25) - 3 = 300 - 3 = 297 implies k approx 17.233 ) not integer.For ( n = 6 ):[k^2 = 12(36) - 3 = 432 - 3 = 429 implies k approx 20.712 ) not integer.For ( n = 7 ):[k^2 = 12(49) - 3 = 588 - 3 = 585 implies k approx 24.186 ) not integer.For ( n = 8 ):[k^2 = 12(64) - 3 = 768 - 3 = 765 implies k approx 27.66 ) not integer.For ( n = 9 ):[k^2 = 12(81) - 3 = 972 - 3 = 969 implies k approx 31.12 ) not integer.For ( n = 10 ):[k^2 = 12(100) - 3 = 1200 - 3 = 1197 implies k approx 34.6 ) not integer.Hmm, so the only solution I found so far is ( n = 1 ). But the problem states ( n > 2 ), so I need to find ( n > 2 ).Maybe I need to look for larger ( n ). Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate solutions.I recall that Pell equations have infinitely many solutions, and they can be generated from the minimal solution. The minimal solution here is ( (k, n) = (3, 1) ). Maybe I can use this to generate more solutions.The general method for solving Pell equations involves finding the fundamental solution and then generating others using recurrence relations. For the equation ( k^2 - 12n^2 = -3 ), the minimal solution is ( (3, 1) ).To find more solutions, I can use the method of continued fractions or use the recurrence relations derived from the fundamental solution.Let me recall that for Pell equations of the form ( x^2 - Dy^2 = N ), once a minimal solution is found, other solutions can be generated by multiplying by the fundamental unit of the ring ( mathbb{Z}[sqrt{D}] ).In this case, ( D = 12 ), so the fundamental unit of ( mathbb{Z}[sqrt{12}] ) is ( 2 + sqrt{12} ), since ( (2 + sqrt{12})^2 = 7 + 4sqrt{12} ), and so on.But I'm not entirely sure how to apply this here. Maybe I can use the minimal solution to generate more solutions by using the recurrence relations.Let me denote the solutions as ( (k_m, n_m) ). Starting from ( (k_1, n_1) = (3, 1) ), I can generate ( (k_{m+1}, n_{m+1}) ) from ( (k_m, n_m) ) using some recurrence.I think the recurrence relations for Pell equations are:[k_{m+1} = k_1 k_m + D n_1 n_m][n_{m+1} = k_1 n_m + n_1 k_m]But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the method of continued fractions to find more solutions.Alternatively, I can note that the equation ( k^2 - 12n^2 = -3 ) can be rewritten as:[k^2 = 12n^2 - 3]Which implies that ( k ) must be a multiple of 3, since the right-hand side is divisible by 3. Let me set ( k = 3m ), then:[(3m)^2 = 12n^2 - 3][9m^2 = 12n^2 - 3][12n^2 - 9m^2 = 3][4n^2 - 3m^2 = 1]So now, the equation becomes:[4n^2 - 3m^2 = 1]This is another Pell-type equation. Let me write it as:[4n^2 - 3m^2 = 1]Or,[(2n)^2 - 3m^2 = 1]Let me set ( p = 2n ), then the equation becomes:[p^2 - 3m^2 = 1]Ah, this is the standard Pell equation for ( D = 3 ). The minimal solution for ( p^2 - 3m^2 = 1 ) is ( (p, m) = (2, 1) ), since ( 2^2 - 3(1)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1 ).The solutions to this Pell equation can be generated using the recurrence relations:[p_{m+1} = p_1 p_m + 3 m_1 m_m][m_{m+1} = p_1 m_m + m_1 p_m]Given that the minimal solution is ( (2, 1) ), we can generate more solutions.Let's compute the next few solutions.First solution: ( (p_1, m_1) = (2, 1) )Second solution:[p_2 = 2*2 + 3*1*1 = 4 + 3 = 7][m_2 = 2*1 + 1*2 = 2 + 2 = 4]Check: ( 7^2 - 3*4^2 = 49 - 48 = 1 ). Correct.Third solution:[p_3 = 2*7 + 3*1*4 = 14 + 12 = 26][m_3 = 2*4 + 1*7 = 8 + 7 = 15]Check: ( 26^2 - 3*15^2 = 676 - 675 = 1 ). Correct.Fourth solution:[p_4 = 2*26 + 3*1*15 = 52 + 45 = 97][m_4 = 2*15 + 1*26 = 30 + 26 = 56]Check: ( 97^2 - 3*56^2 = 9409 - 9408 = 1 ). Correct.So, the solutions for ( p ) and ( m ) are growing rapidly. Now, since ( p = 2n ), we can find ( n ) from each solution.First solution: ( p = 2 implies n = 1 )Second solution: ( p = 7 implies n = 7/2 = 3.5 ). Not integer.Third solution: ( p = 26 implies n = 26/2 = 13 ). Integer.Fourth solution: ( p = 97 implies n = 97/2 = 48.5 ). Not integer.Fifth solution: Let's compute the fifth solution.[p_5 = 2*97 + 3*1*56 = 194 + 168 = 362][m_5 = 2*56 + 1*97 = 112 + 97 = 209]Check: ( 362^2 - 3*209^2 = 131044 - 131043 = 1 ). Correct.So, ( p = 362 implies n = 362/2 = 181 ). Integer.So, the integer solutions for ( n ) are at every other step: 1, 13, 181, etc.Therefore, the solutions for ( n ) are 1, 13, 181, and so on.Given that the problem states ( n > 2 ), the smallest such ( n ) is 13.Now, I need to show that ( n ) can be expressed as the sum of two squares.Let's take ( n = 13 ). Can 13 be expressed as the sum of two squares?Yes, ( 13 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 ).Similarly, ( n = 181 ). Let's see:181 divided by 4 is 45.25, so it's 1 mod 4. Let's check if it's a sum of two squares.We can try different combinations:13^2 = 169, 181 - 169 = 12, which is not a perfect square.12^2 = 144, 181 - 144 = 37, not a square.11^2 = 121, 181 - 121 = 60, not a square.10^2 = 100, 181 - 100 = 81, which is 9^2.So, ( 181 = 10^2 + 9^2 ).Therefore, 181 is a sum of two squares.Similarly, 13 is a sum of two squares.So, it seems that the solutions for ( n ) generated by this Pell equation are indeed sums of two squares.Now, to generalize, I need to show that any ( n ) obtained from this equation can be expressed as the sum of two squares.Given that ( n ) satisfies ( n^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1 ), and that ( n ) is part of a solution to the Pell equation ( k^2 - 12n^2 = -3 ), which leads to the Pell equation ( p^2 - 3m^2 = 1 ), and the solutions for ( n ) are integers at every other step, and these ( n ) are sums of two squares.Moreover, since the Pell equation generates infinitely many solutions, there are infinitely many ( n ) satisfying the original condition, and each of these ( n ) can be expressed as the sum of two squares.Therefore, such ( n ) exists, and any ( n > 2 ) satisfying the given condition is a sum of two squares of positive integers."},{"question":"Nova went to inflate some soccer balls. 40 percent had holes in them and could not inflate, while 20% of the remaining balls were overinflated and exploded. 48 balls were inflated successfully and could be used.

This can be expressed as ( 0.60x ).Out of these remaining balls, 20% were overinflated and exploded, which means 80% were successfully inflated. This is represented as ( 0.80 times 0.60x ).We know that the number of successfully inflated balls is 48, so we set up the equation:[ 0.80 times 0.60x = 48 ]Simplifying the equation:[ 0.48x = 48 ]To find ( x ), we divide both sides by 0.48:[ x = frac{48}{0.48} ][ x = 100 ]Therefore, Nova initially had 100 soccer balls."},{"question":"What is the largest possible distance between two points, one on the sphere of radius 15 with center ((4, -5, 10)), and the other on the sphere of radius 50 with center ((-6, 20, -10))?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about finding the largest possible distance between two points. One point is on a sphere with radius 15 and center at (4, -5, 10), and the other point is on another sphere with radius 50 and center at (-6, 20, -10). Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, I know that a sphere in three-dimensional space is all the points that are a fixed distance (the radius) away from a given center point. So, the first sphere has all points that are 15 units away from (4, -5, 10), and the second sphere has all points that are 50 units away from (-6, 20, -10).Now, the question is asking for the largest possible distance between any two points, one on each sphere. That makes me think about how these two spheres are positioned relative to each other. If I can figure out the distance between their centers, then maybe I can use that to find the maximum distance between a point on each sphere.Let me recall the distance formula in three dimensions. The distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is given by:[ sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2} ]So, applying this to the centers of the two spheres:First sphere center: (4, -5, 10)Second sphere center: (-6, 20, -10)Calculating the differences in each coordinate:x: -6 - 4 = -10y: 20 - (-5) = 25z: -10 - 10 = -20Now, squaring each of these differences:(-10)^2 = 10025^2 = 625(-20)^2 = 400Adding them up: 100 + 625 + 400 = 1125Taking the square root of 1125. Hmm, 1125 is 225 * 5, and 225 is 15^2, so sqrt(1125) = 15 * sqrt(5). Wait, is that right? Let me check:15^2 = 225225 * 5 = 1125So, sqrt(1125) = sqrt(225 * 5) = sqrt(225) * sqrt(5) = 15 * sqrt(5). Okay, that seems correct.So, the distance between the centers is 15‚àö5 units.Now, to find the maximum distance between a point on the first sphere and a point on the second sphere, I think I need to consider the direction in which these points lie relative to the line connecting the centers. Intuitively, the farthest apart two points on the spheres would be if they are both aligned along the line connecting the centers but on opposite sides. That way, you're adding the distance from each center to their respective points.So, if I imagine the two spheres, one with radius 15 and the other with radius 50, and the distance between their centers is 15‚àö5, then the maximum distance between any two points on the spheres should be the distance between the centers plus the two radii.Wait, let me think about that again. If I have two spheres, and I want the farthest points, they should be in a straight line passing through both centers, right? So, one point would be on the first sphere in the direction away from the second sphere, and the other point would be on the second sphere in the direction away from the first sphere. So, the total distance would be the distance between centers plus the two radii.But hold on, is that correct? Let me visualize it. If I have two spheres, each point on their surfaces, the maximum distance between them would indeed be when they are colinear with the centers and on opposite sides. So, yes, the distance would be the distance between centers plus both radii.So, in this case, the distance between centers is 15‚àö5, and the radii are 15 and 50. Therefore, the maximum distance should be 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50.Simplifying that, 15 + 50 is 65, so the total distance is 65 + 15‚àö5.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the assistant's solution had 25‚àö3 instead of 15‚àö5. Did I make a mistake in calculating the distance between centers?Let me recalculate the distance between centers.First sphere center: (4, -5, 10)Second sphere center: (-6, 20, -10)Calculating the differences:x: -6 - 4 = -10y: 20 - (-5) = 25z: -10 - 10 = -20Squaring each difference:(-10)^2 = 10025^2 = 625(-20)^2 = 400Adding them up: 100 + 625 + 400 = 1125Square root of 1125: sqrt(1125) = sqrt(225 * 5) = 15‚àö5So, my calculation seems correct. The distance between centers is indeed 15‚àö5, not 25‚àö3 as in the assistant's solution. Hmm, that's confusing.Wait, maybe the assistant made a mistake in their calculation. Let me check their steps.They wrote:QR = sqrt[(4 - (-6))^2 + (-5 - 20)^2 + (10 - (-10))^2]= sqrt[(4+6)^2 + (-5-20)^2 + (10+10)^2]= sqrt[10^2 + (-25)^2 + 20^2]= sqrt[100 + 625 + 400]= sqrt[1125] = 25‚àö3Wait, but 10^2 is 100, (-25)^2 is 625, and 20^2 is 400. Adding those gives 1125, which is correct. But sqrt(1125) is 15‚àö5, not 25‚àö3. Because 1125 divided by 25 is 45, and sqrt(45) is 3‚àö5, so 25‚àö3 would be sqrt(1875), which is not 1125.So, the assistant incorrectly simplified sqrt(1125) as 25‚àö3 instead of 15‚àö5. That seems like a mistake.Therefore, the correct distance between centers is 15‚àö5, and the maximum distance between two points on the spheres would be 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.But wait, let me think again. Is it just the distance between centers plus both radii? Or is it something else?I recall that for two spheres, the maximum distance between any two points on their surfaces is equal to the distance between their centers plus the sum of their radii. That makes sense because if you have two spheres, the farthest apart two points would be along the line connecting their centers, each on the side away from the other sphere.So, yes, that should be correct. Therefore, the maximum distance is 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.But let me double-check if that's the case. Suppose the distance between centers is D, and the radii are r1 and r2. Then, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is D + r1 + r2.Yes, that seems right. Because if you have two spheres, the farthest points would be in the direction away from each other, so you add the distance between centers and both radii.Therefore, in this case, D = 15‚àö5, r1 = 15, r2 = 50, so the maximum distance is 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.But wait, the assistant's answer was 65 + 25‚àö3, which is different. So, I think the assistant made a mistake in calculating the distance between centers.Let me recast the problem to see if I can find another approach or confirm my answer.Alternatively, I can think of the two spheres and imagine moving along the line connecting their centers. The point on the first sphere farthest from the second sphere would be in the direction away from the second sphere, and similarly, the point on the second sphere farthest from the first sphere would be in the direction away from the first sphere.Therefore, the distance between these two points would be the distance between centers plus the two radii.So, if I denote the centers as Q and R, then the maximum distance AB is AQ + QR + RB, where AQ is the radius of the first sphere (15), QR is the distance between centers (15‚àö5), and RB is the radius of the second sphere (50). So, AB = 15 + 15‚àö5 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I consider vectors, the vector from Q to R is (-10, 25, -20). The unit vector in that direction would be (-10, 25, -20) divided by its magnitude, which is 15‚àö5. So, the point A on the first sphere in the direction away from R would be Q plus the radius times the unit vector in the direction from Q to R. Similarly, the point B on the second sphere in the direction away from Q would be R plus the radius times the unit vector in the direction from R to Q.But calculating those points might be more complicated, but the distance between them should still be the same as QR + r1 + r2.Therefore, I think my answer is correct: 65 + 15‚àö5.But just to be thorough, let me calculate 15‚àö5 numerically to see what it is approximately, and then 65 + 15‚àö5.‚àö5 is approximately 2.236, so 15 * 2.236 ‚âà 33.54.So, 65 + 33.54 ‚âà 98.54.If I calculate the assistant's answer, 25‚àö3, which is approximately 25 * 1.732 ‚âà 43.3. So, 65 + 43.3 ‚âà 108.3.Wait, that's a significant difference. So, which one is correct?Wait, let me recalculate the distance between centers.First sphere center: (4, -5, 10)Second sphere center: (-6, 20, -10)Differences:x: -6 - 4 = -10y: 20 - (-5) = 25z: -10 - 10 = -20Squares:(-10)^2 = 10025^2 = 625(-20)^2 = 400Sum: 100 + 625 + 400 = 1125Square root of 1125: Let's see, 33^2 = 1089, 34^2 = 1156, so sqrt(1125) is between 33 and 34. 33.54, as I calculated earlier.So, 15‚àö5 is approximately 33.54, which matches.But the assistant said sqrt(1125) = 25‚àö3, which is incorrect because 25‚àö3 is approximately 43.3, and 43.3^2 is approximately 1875, not 1125.So, the assistant made a mistake in simplifying sqrt(1125). Instead of 25‚àö3, it should be 15‚àö5.Therefore, the correct maximum distance is 65 + 15‚àö5.But just to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach.Suppose I have two spheres, S1 with center Q and radius r1, and S2 with center R and radius r2. The maximum distance between any two points A on S1 and B on S2 is equal to the distance QR plus r1 + r2.This is because the points A and B that maximize the distance AB lie along the line QR extended beyond Q and R, respectively. So, A is in the direction from Q away from R, and B is in the direction from R away from Q.Therefore, AB = AQ + QR + RB = r1 + QR + r2.So, in this case, QR is 15‚àö5, r1 is 15, r2 is 50, so AB = 15 + 15‚àö5 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, if I think about the spheres overlapping or not, but in this case, the distance between centers is 15‚àö5, which is approximately 33.54, and the sum of the radii is 15 + 50 = 65, which is greater than the distance between centers. Wait, no, 65 is greater than 33.54, so the spheres are overlapping? Wait, no, the sum of the radii is 65, and the distance between centers is approximately 33.54, which is less than 65, so the spheres overlap.Wait, but if the distance between centers is less than the sum of the radii, the spheres intersect. So, in that case, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres would still be the distance between centers plus the two radii, right?Wait, no, actually, if the spheres intersect, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is still the distance between centers plus the two radii. Because even if they intersect, the farthest points would still be in the direction away from each other.Wait, let me think about it. If two spheres intersect, the line connecting their centers passes through the overlapping region. So, the points on each sphere that are farthest from each other would still be along that line, but on the opposite sides from each other.So, yes, even if the spheres intersect, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is still the distance between centers plus the two radii.Therefore, in this case, since the distance between centers is 15‚àö5 ‚âà 33.54, and the sum of the radii is 65, which is greater than 33.54, the spheres intersect. But the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is still 65 + 15‚àö5.Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the distance between centers is 15‚àö5, and the sum of the radii is 65, then 65 is greater than 15‚àö5, which is approximately 33.54. So, the spheres intersect because the sum of the radii is greater than the distance between centers.But in that case, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres would still be the distance between centers plus the two radii, right? Because even though they intersect, the farthest points are still in the direction away from each other.Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose two circles (in 2D) with centers 10 units apart, and radii 15 and 20. The sum of the radii is 35, which is greater than 10, so they intersect. The maximum distance between two points on the circles would be 10 + 15 + 20 = 45, which is correct because the points are aligned along the line connecting the centers, on the opposite sides.Similarly, in 3D, the same logic applies. So, even if the spheres intersect, the maximum distance between two points on them is the distance between centers plus the two radii.Therefore, in this case, the maximum distance is 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5.So, I think my initial conclusion is correct, and the assistant made a mistake in their calculation by incorrectly simplifying sqrt(1125) as 25‚àö3 instead of 15‚àö5.Therefore, the correct answer should be 65 + 15‚àö5.But just to be absolutely sure, let me calculate 15‚àö5 and 25‚àö3 numerically.15‚àö5 ‚âà 15 * 2.236 ‚âà 33.5425‚àö3 ‚âà 25 * 1.732 ‚âà 43.3So, 65 + 15‚àö5 ‚âà 65 + 33.54 ‚âà 98.5465 + 25‚àö3 ‚âà 65 + 43.3 ‚âà 108.3Given that the distance between centers is approximately 33.54, and the sum of the radii is 65, which is greater than 33.54, the spheres intersect. Therefore, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres should be less than 65 + 33.54, which is 98.54. Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, the maximum distance is the distance between centers plus the two radii, regardless of whether the spheres intersect or not. So, even if the spheres intersect, the maximum distance between two points on them is still the distance between centers plus the two radii.But in this case, the distance between centers is 15‚àö5 ‚âà 33.54, and the sum of the radii is 65, which is greater than 33.54, so the spheres intersect. However, the maximum distance between two points on the spheres is still 15‚àö5 + 15 + 50 = 65 + 15‚àö5 ‚âà 98.54.Wait, but if the spheres intersect, isn't the maximum distance between two points on them just the distance between centers plus the two radii? Yes, because the points are on opposite sides of the line connecting the centers.So, I think my answer is correct.Therefore, the largest possible distance between two points, one on each sphere, is 65 + 15‚àö5.But just to make sure, let me think about the assistant's solution again. They calculated the distance between centers as 25‚àö3, which is incorrect. They must have made a mistake in their calculation.So, in conclusion, the correct answer is 65 + 15‚àö5."},{"question":"Given a polynomial  Pin mathbb{Z}[X]  of degree  k , show that there always exist  2d  distinct integers  x_1, x_2, cdots x_{2d}  such that    P(x_1)+P(x_2)+cdots P(x_{d})=P(x_{d+1})+P(x_{d+2})+cdots + P(x_{2d})    for some  dle k+1 .[Extra: Is this still true if  dle k ? (Of course false for linear polynomials, but what about higher degree?)]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that for any polynomial ( P in mathbb{Z}[X] ) of degree ( k ), there exist ( 2d ) distinct integers ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2d} ) such that the sum of the first ( d ) polynomials equals the sum of the next ( d ) polynomials. And this should hold for some ( d leq k+1 ). There's also an extra question about whether this is still true if ( d leq k ), but I'll focus on the main problem first.Alright, let me break this down. The polynomial ( P ) has integer coefficients and is of degree ( k ). So, ( P(x) ) is something like ( a_k x^k + a_{k-1} x^{k-1} + ldots + a_0 ), where each ( a_i ) is an integer. The problem is asking for ( 2d ) distinct integers such that the sum of ( P ) evaluated at the first ( d ) integers equals the sum of ( P ) evaluated at the next ( d ) integers. And ( d ) should be at most ( k+1 ).Hmm, okay. So, maybe I can think about this in terms of some kind of pigeonhole principle? If I consider a large enough set of integers, then the number of possible sums might be limited, so by the pigeonhole principle, some sums must repeat. That could give me the equality I need.Let me try to formalize this idea. Suppose I take a large integer ( N ) and consider all possible ( (k+1) )-tuples of integers from 1 to ( N ). Each tuple would correspond to a sum of ( P ) evaluated at those ( k+1 ) points. The number of such tuples is ( binom{N}{k+1} ), which grows polynomially with ( N ). On the other hand, the number of possible sums, since ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( k ), the sum of ( k+1 ) such polynomials would be a polynomial of degree ( k ) in each variable, but when considering all variables, the number of distinct sums might grow more slowly.Wait, actually, the sum of ( k+1 ) polynomials of degree ( k ) would result in a polynomial of degree ( k ) in each variable, but when considering all variables together, the number of distinct sums might be something like ( O(N^k) ). So, if I have ( binom{N}{k+1} ) tuples and only ( O(N^k) ) possible sums, then for large enough ( N ), the number of tuples exceeds the number of possible sums. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two different tuples that give the same sum.But how does that help me? Well, if two different tuples give the same sum, then perhaps I can find a subset of the integers in these tuples that can be split into two equal sums. Let me think about this.Suppose I have two tuples ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k+1}) ) and ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{k+1}) ) such that the sum ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) + ldots + P(x_{k+1}) ) equals ( P(y_1) + P(y_2) + ldots + P(y_{k+1}) ). Now, these tuples might share some common integers. Let's say they share ( k+1 - d ) integers. Then, the remaining ( 2d ) integers are distinct between the two tuples. So, if I take the ( d ) integers from the first tuple that aren't shared and the ( d ) integers from the second tuple that aren't shared, their sums should be equal because the shared parts cancel out.That seems promising. So, if I can ensure that the two tuples share ( k+1 - d ) integers, then the remaining ( 2d ) integers can be split into two groups of ( d ) each with equal sums. Therefore, ( d ) would be at most ( k+1 ), since ( k+1 - d ) has to be non-negative.But wait, how do I know that such tuples exist? I mean, I know by the pigeonhole principle that there are two tuples with the same sum, but how do I ensure that they share exactly ( k+1 - d ) integers? Maybe I don't need to specify the exact number of shared integers, but rather, by considering all possible overlaps, I can find some ( d ) such that the non-overlapping parts can be split into two equal sums.Alternatively, maybe I can use induction on the degree ( k ). For the base case, when ( k = 0 ), the polynomial is constant, so any two points will trivially satisfy the condition since both sums will be equal to the constant times ( d ). But the problem specifies ( d leq k+1 ), which for ( k=0 ) would be ( d leq 1 ), so we need two points such that ( P(x_1) = P(x_2) ). Since ( P ) is constant, this is always true.For ( k = 1 ), a linear polynomial. Here, ( d leq 2 ). So, we need four distinct integers such that the sum of two equals the sum of the other two. But wait, for linear polynomials, this is essentially finding two pairs of integers whose average is the same. Since a linear polynomial is just a linear function, the sum ( P(x) + P(y) ) is linear in ( x + y ). So, if we can find two pairs ( (x_1, x_2) ) and ( (x_3, x_4) ) such that ( x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4 ), then ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) + P(x_4) ). This is a classic result in additive combinatorics; in fact, for any set of integers, you can find such pairs as long as the set is large enough.But the problem is asking for existence, not for a specific construction. So, perhaps by choosing a sufficiently large set of integers, we can always find such pairs. Extending this idea, for higher degrees, we might need to consider more points, but the principle remains similar.Wait, but the problem is not just about pairs; it's about splitting ( 2d ) points into two groups of ( d ) each with equal sums. For higher degrees, the sums are more complex, but the pigeonhole principle should still apply because the number of possible sums grows polynomially, while the number of tuples grows combinatorially.Let me try to formalize this. Let's fix ( d ) as ( k+1 ). Then, we need ( 2(k+1) ) distinct integers such that the sum of the first ( k+1 ) equals the sum of the next ( k+1 ). But actually, the problem allows ( d ) to be any number up to ( k+1 ), so maybe we can find a smaller ( d ) as well.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the differences between the sums. If I have two tuples with the same sum, then their difference is zero. Maybe I can construct a system of equations or use some algebraic manipulation to find the required ( x_i ).Wait, another approach: consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = P(x) ). Since ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( k ), the difference ( Q(x) - Q(y) ) is divisible by ( x - y ). Maybe I can use this property to find some relations between the values of ( P ) at different points.But I'm not sure how to directly apply this to the problem at hand. Let me get back to the pigeonhole principle idea. If I consider all possible sums of ( d ) polynomials, the number of such sums is limited, so if I have enough points, two different subsets must have the same sum.But in our case, we need two subsets of size ( d ) such that their sums are equal. So, if I have ( 2d ) points, I can partition them into two subsets of size ( d ) each, and if their sums are equal, we're done. But how do I ensure that such a partition exists?Wait, maybe I can use the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGinzburg‚ÄìZiv theorem, which states that for any ( 2n - 1 ) integers, there exists a subset of ( n ) integers whose sum is divisible by ( n ). But in our case, we need two subsets of size ( d ) with equal sums, not necessarily divisible by anything. However, the theorem might be related in spirit.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the idea of considering the differences between the sums. If I have a large enough set, the number of possible differences is limited, so some differences must repeat, leading to equal sums.But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I fix ( d = k+1 ). Then, I need ( 2(k+1) ) distinct integers such that the sum of the first ( k+1 ) equals the sum of the next ( k+1 ). Since ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( k ), the sum of ( k+1 ) polynomials would involve terms up to degree ( k ). But I'm not sure how this helps.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that a polynomial of degree ( k ) is determined by its values at ( k+1 ) points. So, if I have two sets of ( k+1 ) points each, and their sums are equal, then perhaps the polynomials evaluated at these points have some kind of symmetry or cancellation.Alternatively, perhaps I can construct such points explicitly. For example, for a quadratic polynomial, I can choose points symmetric around some axis, so that their sums cancel out. But this might not work for higher degrees.Wait, another idea: consider the polynomial ( P(x) ) and its behavior modulo some integer. If I can find ( 2d ) points such that the sum of the first ( d ) is congruent to the sum of the next ( d ) modulo some integer, then perhaps I can lift this to an equality in integers.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently. Let me consider the function ( S(n) = P(1) + P(2) + ldots + P(n) ). This is a polynomial of degree ( k+1 ). Then, the difference ( S(m) - S(n) ) is a polynomial of degree ( k+1 ) as well. Maybe I can use this to find some cancellation.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that a polynomial of degree ( k+1 ) can have at most ( k+1 ) roots. So, if I set up an equation involving ( S(m) - S(n) = 0 ), I can find some ( m ) and ( n ) such that this holds. But I'm not sure how to relate this to the problem.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of ( P(x) ) over an arithmetic progression can be expressed in terms of the polynomial's coefficients. But I'm not sure.Wait, going back to the pigeonhole principle idea, let's make it more precise. Suppose I choose ( N ) to be very large, say ( N = 2^{k+1} ). Then, the number of possible sums of ( d ) polynomials is at most ( N^k ), as each sum is a polynomial of degree ( k ). On the other hand, the number of possible subsets of size ( d ) is ( binom{N}{d} ), which is much larger than ( N^k ) for large ( N ). Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two different subsets with the same sum.But wait, in our problem, we need two subsets of size ( d ) such that their sums are equal, and the subsets are disjoint. So, it's not just any two subsets, but two subsets that are disjoint and of size ( d ). So, the number of such pairs is ( binom{N}{2d} times binom{2d}{d} ), which is still very large. So, perhaps for large enough ( N ), there must be such pairs.But I'm not sure if this directly gives me the result, because the number of possible sums might still be too large. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, another idea: consider the polynomial ( P(x) ) and its finite differences. The ( (k+1) )-th finite difference of ( P ) is zero, since it's a polynomial of degree ( k ). Maybe I can use this property to construct the required sums.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of ( P(x) ) over a complete residue system modulo some integer can be zero. But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think about the problem again. I need ( 2d ) distinct integers such that the sum of ( P ) at the first ( d ) equals the sum at the next ( d ). So, essentially, I need a partition of ( 2d ) points into two equal-sized subsets with equal sums.This is similar to the partition problem in computer science, which is NP-hard, but in our case, we're not given specific numbers, but rather a polynomial, so maybe there's a way to exploit the structure of the polynomial.Wait, another thought: since ( P ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, the differences ( P(x+1) - P(x) ) are also polynomials with integer coefficients, of degree ( k-1 ). Maybe I can use this recursive property to build up the required sums.Alternatively, perhaps I can use induction on the degree ( k ). Suppose the statement is true for polynomials of degree ( k-1 ), can I prove it for degree ( k )?For the base case, ( k=0 ), as I thought earlier, it's trivial because the polynomial is constant, so any two points will do.Assume it's true for degree ( k-1 ). Now, consider a polynomial ( P ) of degree ( k ). Maybe I can write ( P(x) = Q(x) + ax^k ), where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( k-1 ). Then, the sum ( P(x_1) + ldots + P(x_d) ) can be written as ( Q(x_1) + ldots + Q(x_d) + a(x_1^k + ldots + x_d^k) ). Similarly for the other side. Since ( Q ) satisfies the condition by induction, maybe I can adjust the ( x_i ) to account for the ( ax^k ) term.But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, going back to the pigeonhole principle, perhaps I can consider the sums of ( P ) over all possible ( d )-element subsets of a large set of integers. The number of such subsets is ( binom{N}{d} ), and the number of possible sums is at most ( N^k ). So, if ( binom{N}{d} > N^k ), then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two different subsets with the same sum.But in our problem, we need two subsets that are disjoint and have the same sum. So, the number of such pairs is ( binom{N}{2d} times binom{2d}{d} ), which is still very large. So, for large enough ( N ), this should be possible.But I need to make sure that the two subsets are disjoint. So, perhaps I can first choose a large enough ( N ) such that ( binom{N}{2d} times binom{2d}{d} > N^k ). Then, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two disjoint subsets of size ( d ) with the same sum.But I'm not sure if this is rigorous enough. Maybe I need to formalize it more.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of possible sums is limited, so if I have enough points, I can find the required subsets. Let me try to write this more formally.Let ( S ) be a set of ( 2d ) distinct integers. The number of possible sums of ( d ) elements from ( S ) is at most ( (2d)^k ), since each sum is a polynomial of degree ( k ) in the variables. On the other hand, the number of such subsets is ( binom{2d}{d} ), which is exponential in ( d ). So, for large enough ( d ), ( binom{2d}{d} > (2d)^k ), meaning that by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two different subsets with the same sum.But wait, in our problem, ( d ) is bounded by ( k+1 ), so this might not directly apply. Hmm.Wait, maybe I can fix ( d = k+1 ) and then consider a set ( S ) of ( 2(k+1) ) integers. The number of possible sums of ( k+1 ) elements is at most ( (2(k+1))^k ), which is polynomial in ( k ). On the other hand, the number of subsets of size ( k+1 ) is ( binom{2(k+1)}{k+1} ), which is exponential in ( k ). So, for large enough ( k ), this would imply that there are two different subsets with the same sum.But I'm not sure if this is the right way to apply the pigeonhole principle. Maybe I need to consider the entire set of integers up to some ( N ), not just a fixed ( 2d ) points.Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach: consider all possible sums of ( d ) polynomials from a set of ( N ) integers. The number of such sums is at most ( N^k ), as each sum is a polynomial of degree ( k ). The number of subsets of size ( d ) is ( binom{N}{d} ). So, if ( binom{N}{d} > N^k ), then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two different subsets with the same sum.But in our problem, we need two subsets that are disjoint. So, the number of such pairs is ( binom{N}{2d} times binom{2d}{d} ). So, if ( binom{N}{2d} times binom{2d}{d} > N^k ), then there must be two disjoint subsets of size ( d ) with the same sum.Now, let's see if this inequality holds for some ( N ). For fixed ( d ) and ( k ), as ( N ) grows, ( binom{N}{2d} ) grows like ( N^{2d} ), and ( binom{2d}{d} ) is a constant. So, the left-hand side grows polynomially with ( N ), while the right-hand side grows like ( N^k ). So, if ( 2d > k ), then for large enough ( N ), the inequality holds.But in our problem, ( d leq k+1 ), so ( 2d leq 2(k+1) ). So, if ( 2(k+1) > k ), which is true for ( k geq 1 ), then the inequality holds for large enough ( N ).Therefore, by choosing a sufficiently large ( N ), we can ensure that there exist two disjoint subsets of size ( d ) with the same sum. Hence, the required ( 2d ) integers exist.Wait, but I need to make sure that ( d leq k+1 ). So, if I set ( d = k+1 ), then ( 2d = 2(k+1) ), and the inequality ( binom{N}{2(k+1)} times binom{2(k+1)}{k+1} > N^k ) holds for large enough ( N ). Therefore, there exist ( 2(k+1) ) integers such that the sum of the first ( k+1 ) equals the sum of the next ( k+1 ).But the problem allows ( d ) to be any number up to ( k+1 ), so maybe we can find a smaller ( d ) as well. However, the problem only requires the existence for some ( d leq k+1 ), so finding ( d = k+1 ) suffices.Wait, but what if ( d ) is smaller? For example, for a quadratic polynomial (( k=2 )), can we find ( d=2 ) or ( d=1 )? For ( d=1 ), we need two points such that ( P(x_1) = P(x_2) ). For a quadratic polynomial, this is possible if the polynomial is symmetric around its vertex, but not necessarily for all quadratics. For example, ( P(x) = x^2 ) has ( P(1) = P(-1) ), but if the polynomial is shifted, like ( P(x) = (x-1)^2 ), then ( P(0) = 1 ) and ( P(2) = 1 ), so again, two points with the same value.But for a general quadratic polynomial, it's not necessarily symmetric, but since it's a polynomial with integer coefficients, maybe we can still find two points with the same value. Wait, actually, no. For example, consider ( P(x) = x ). It's linear, but if we consider ( d=1 ), we need two points with the same value, which is impossible unless ( P ) is constant. So, for linear polynomials, ( d=1 ) is not possible unless ( P ) is constant, but the problem allows ( d leq k+1 = 2 ), so for linear polynomials, we can have ( d=2 ), which would require four points such that the sum of two equals the sum of the other two. As I thought earlier, this is possible by choosing two pairs with the same average.Wait, but for quadratic polynomials, ( d=2 ) would require four points such that the sum of two equals the sum of the other two. But since ( P ) is quadratic, the sum ( P(x) + P(y) ) is a quadratic function in ( x ) and ( y ). So, finding two pairs with the same sum might be more involved, but I think it's still possible by choosing points symmetrically or using the pigeonhole principle.But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The main idea is that for any polynomial of degree ( k ), by choosing a sufficiently large set of integers, the number of possible sums of ( d ) polynomials exceeds the number of possible values, so by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two different subsets with the same sum. And since we can choose ( d leq k+1 ), this should work.So, putting it all together, the strategy is:1. Choose a sufficiently large integer ( N ).2. Consider all possible ( d )-element subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, N} ).3. The number of such subsets is ( binom{N}{d} ).4. The number of possible sums of ( P ) over these subsets is at most ( N^k ).5. For large enough ( N ), ( binom{N}{d} > N^k ), so by the pigeonhole principle, there exist two different subsets with the same sum.6. If these subsets are disjoint, we're done. If not, we can adjust by considering larger ( N ) or using more sophisticated combinatorial arguments to ensure disjointness.Therefore, such ( 2d ) integers exist for some ( d leq k+1 ).As for the extra question, whether this is still true if ( d leq k ), the answer is no for linear polynomials, as we saw earlier. For higher degrees, it might still be possible, but I'm not sure. It would require a similar argument but with ( d leq k ), which might not always hold because the number of possible sums might not be limited enough to guarantee the pigeonhole principle applies. So, it's likely false for some higher-degree polynomials as well, but I need to think more about it.But for now, focusing on the main problem, I think the pigeonhole principle approach works, and the required integers exist for some ( d leq k+1 )."},{"question":"In the book \\"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art,\\" it is noted that \\"when two quantities have opposite meanings, they should be named as positive and negative.\\" This means: if there are two numbers with opposite meanings, they should be called positive and negative respectively.

Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down.First, let me understand the terms in the sum. The numerator is m(m-1)...(m-k+1) multiplied by k. That part looks like a permutation. Specifically, m(m-1)...(m-k+1) is the number of ways to arrange k distinct items from m, right? So, that's like P(m, k), the permutation formula.

Let's imagine we have a sequence of m+1 numbers, each chosen uniformly at random from 1 to m. What is the probability that the first k numbers are all distinct and the (k+1)-th number is equal to one of the first k numbers?Let me try to model this. The total number of possible sequences is m^{m+1}. For each k, the number of sequences where the first k numbers are distinct and the (k+1)-th number is one of the first k is equal to P(m, k) * k * m^{m - k}. Because:- P(m, k) is the number of ways to choose the first k distinct numbers.- Then, the (k+1)-th number has to be one of those k, so k choices.- The remaining m - k numbers can be anything, so m^{m - k}.So, the number of such sequences is P(m, k) * k * m^{m - k}. Then, the probability of this happening is [P(m, k) * k * m^{m - k}] / m^{m+1} = [P(m, k) * k] / m^{k+1}, which is exactly the term in our sum.Therefore, the sum from k=1 to m of [P(m, k) * k] / m^{k+1} is the total probability over all possible k of having the first k numbers distinct and the (k+1)-th number repeating one of the first k. Since these are mutually exclusive events (for each sequence, there is exactly one k where this happens), the total probability should be 1.Wait, is that true? For any sequence of m+1 numbers, there must be some k where the first k are distinct and the (k+1)-th is a repeat. Because if all m+1 numbers are distinct, but since we're choosing from only m numbers, that's impossible. So, every sequence must have at least one repeat, and the first repeat occurs at some k between 1 and m. So, the total probability is indeed 1.Therefore, the sum equals 1. That makes sense!But let me double-check. Let's take a small m, say m=2, and compute the sum manually.For m=2:When k=1:Numerator: 2 * 1 = 2Denominator: 2^{2} = 4Term: 2/4 = 1/2When k=2:Numerator: 2 * 1 * 2 = 4Denominator: 2^{3} = 8Term: 4/8 = 1/2Sum: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that works.Another test with m=3:k=1:Numerator: 3 * 1 = 3Denominator: 3^{2} = 9Term: 3/9 = 1/3k=2:Numerator: 3*2 * 2 = 12Denominator: 3^{3} = 27Term: 12/27 = 4/9k=3:Numerator: 3*2*1 * 3 = 18Denominator: 3^{4} = 81Term: 18/81 = 2/9Sum: 1/3 + 4/9 + 2/9 = (3/9 + 4/9 + 2/9) = 9/9 = 1. Perfect.So, the reasoning seems solid. Each term represents the probability that the first k numbers are distinct and the (k+1)-th is a repeat, and since every sequence must have such a k, the total is 1.I think I've got it. The key was to interpret the terms as probabilities in a sequence and realize that they cover all possible cases without overlap, hence summing to 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"When (x^{15} + 3) is divided by (x-1), the remainder is:(textbf{(A)} 4qquadtextbf{(B)} 5qquadtextbf{(C)} 0qquadtextbf{(D)} 3qquadtextbf{(E)} text{None of these answers})","answer":"To find the remainder when (x^{15} + 3) is divided by (x - 1), we can use the Remainder Theorem.

It's a Cauchy problem, which means I need to find the solution that satisfies the given initial conditions. The system is:left{begin{array}{l}frac{dx}{dt} = 8y frac{dy}{dt} = -2z frac{dz}{dt} = 2x + 8y - 2zend{array}right.with initial conditions ( x(0) = -4 ), ( y(0) = 0 ), and ( z(0) = 1 ).Hmm, this looks like a linear system of differential equations. I remember that for such systems, one common approach is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix. That should help me find the general solution, and then I can apply the initial conditions to determine the specific solution.First, I need to represent this system in matrix form. Let me denote the vector of variables as ( mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} x  y  z end{pmatrix} ). Then, the system can be written as:frac{dmathbf{v}}{dt} = A mathbf{v}where ( A ) is the coefficient matrix. Let me write down matrix ( A ):A = begin{pmatrix}0 & 8 & 0 0 & 0 & -2 2 & 8 & -2end{pmatrix}Okay, so to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation ( det(A - rI) = 0 ). Let me set that up.The matrix ( A - rI ) is:begin{pmatrix}-r & 8 & 0 0 & -r & -2 2 & 8 & -2 - rend{pmatrix}Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky, but I can use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Maybe cofactor expansion along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.So, expanding along the first row:det(A - rI) = (-r) cdot detbegin{pmatrix} -r & -2  8 & -2 - r end{pmatrix} - 8 cdot detbegin{pmatrix} 0 & -2  2 & -2 - r end{pmatrix} + 0 cdot det(text{something})Since the last term is multiplied by zero, it disappears. Let's compute the remaining two determinants.First determinant:detbegin{pmatrix} -r & -2  8 & -2 - r end{pmatrix} = (-r)(-2 - r) - (-2)(8) = 2r + r^2 + 16Second determinant:detbegin{pmatrix} 0 & -2  2 & -2 - r end{pmatrix} = 0 cdot (-2 - r) - (-2) cdot 2 = 4Putting it all together:det(A - rI) = (-r)(r^2 + 2r + 16) - 8 cdot 4 = (-r)(r^2 + 2r + 16) - 32Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. The second term is subtracted, so it should be:det(A - rI) = (-r)(r^2 + 2r + 16) - 8 cdot 4 = (-r)(r^2 + 2r + 16) - 32But actually, looking back, the second term is multiplied by -8, so it's:-8 cdot 4 = -32So, the determinant becomes:(-r)(r^2 + 2r + 16) - 32 = -r^3 - 2r^2 - 16r - 32Wait, but I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me double-check:The determinant expansion is:(-r) cdot (r^2 + 2r + 16) - 8 cdot 4 = -r^3 - 2r^2 - 16r - 32Yes, that seems right. So, the characteristic equation is:-r^3 - 2r^2 - 16r - 32 = 0Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor out a negative sign to make it easier:r^3 + 2r^2 + 16r + 32 = 0Now, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 32 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±4, ¬±8, ¬±16, ¬±32.Let me test r = -2:(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 16(-2) + 32 = -8 + 8 - 32 + 32 = 0Yes, r = -2 is a root. So, (r + 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division:-2 | 1  2  16  32          -2  0  -32      1  0  16  0So, the cubic factors as:(r + 2)(r^2 + 0r + 16) = (r + 2)(r^2 + 16)Therefore, the characteristic equation is:(r + 2)(r^2 + 16) = 0So, the eigenvalues are r = -2, and r = ¬±4i.Alright, so we have one real eigenvalue and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues.Now, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.Starting with r = -2.For r = -2, we need to solve (A - (-2)I)v = 0, which is (A + 2I)v = 0.Compute A + 2I:A + 2I = begin{pmatrix}2 & 8 & 0 0 & 2 & -2 2 & 8 & 0end{pmatrix}Wait, let me compute each entry:First row: 0 + 2 = 2, 8 remains, 0 remains.Second row: 0 remains, 0 + 2 = 2, -2 remains.Third row: 2 remains, 8 remains, -2 + 2 = 0.So, the matrix is:begin{pmatrix}2 & 8 & 0 0 & 2 & -2 2 & 8 & 0end{pmatrix}Now, let's write the system of equations:1. 2x + 8y = 02. 2y - 2z = 03. 2x + 8y = 0Equations 1 and 3 are the same, so we have two equations:From equation 1: 2x + 8y = 0 ‚áí x = -4yFrom equation 2: 2y - 2z = 0 ‚áí z = ySo, the eigenvector can be written in terms of y. Let me set y = 1 (for simplicity), then x = -4, z = 1.Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to r = -2 is:mathbf{v}_1 = begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix}Okay, so that's the real eigenvalue case.Now, moving on to the complex eigenvalues r = ¬±4i.For r = 4i, we need to solve (A - 4iI)v = 0.Compute A - 4iI:A - 4iI = begin{pmatrix}-4i & 8 & 0 0 & -4i & -2 2 & 8 & -2 - 4iend{pmatrix}Now, let's write the system of equations:1. -4i x + 8 y = 02. -4i y - 2 z = 03. 2 x + 8 y + (-2 - 4i) z = 0Let me solve this system.From equation 1: -4i x + 8 y = 0 ‚áí 8 y = 4i x ‚áí y = (i/2) xFrom equation 2: -4i y - 2 z = 0 ‚áí -4i y = 2 z ‚áí z = -2i yBut from equation 1, y = (i/2) x, so substitute into z:z = -2i * (i/2) x = -2i*(i/2) x = (-2i^2)/2 x = (-2*(-1))/2 x = (2)/2 x = xSo, z = x.Now, from equation 3: 2x + 8y + (-2 - 4i) z = 0Substitute y = (i/2)x and z = x:2x + 8*(i/2)x + (-2 - 4i)x = 0Simplify:2x + 4i x + (-2 - 4i)x = 0Combine like terms:(2 - 2) x + (4i - 4i) x = 0 ‚áí 0 = 0So, equation 3 is redundant, which is consistent.Thus, the eigenvector can be written in terms of x. Let me set x = 1 (for simplicity), then y = i/2, z = 1.So, the eigenvector corresponding to r = 4i is:mathbf{v}_2 = begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix}Similarly, for r = -4i, the eigenvector would be the complex conjugate:mathbf{v}_3 = begin{pmatrix} 1  -i/2  1 end{pmatrix}Now, with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I can write the general solution of the system.For the real eigenvalue r = -2, the solution is:mathbf{v}_1 e^{-2t} = begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-2t}For the complex eigenvalues r = ¬±4i, the solutions are:mathbf{v}_2 e^{4it} = begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{4it}andmathbf{v}_3 e^{-4it} = begin{pmatrix} 1  -i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-4it}But since we want real solutions, we can take the real and imaginary parts of these complex solutions to form real solutions.Let me write the general solution as a combination of these:mathbf{v}(t) = C_1 begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-2t} + C_2 begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{4it} + C_3 begin{pmatrix} 1  -i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-4it}But since the coefficients ( C_2 ) and ( C_3 ) can be complex, we can express the solution in terms of sine and cosine by taking real and imaginary parts.Alternatively, we can write the general solution using Euler's formula:e^{4it} = cos(4t) + i sin(4t)ande^{-4it} = cos(4t) - i sin(4t)So, combining the terms, we can write the general solution as:mathbf{v}(t) = C_1 begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-2t} + e^{4it} begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix} + e^{-4it} begin{pmatrix} 1  -i/2  1 end{pmatrix}But to make it real, let's express it in terms of sine and cosine.Let me denote ( C_2 = a + ib ) and ( C_3 = a - ib ) to ensure the solution remains real.But perhaps a better approach is to express the complex solutions in terms of real and imaginary parts.Let me consider the solution from ( mathbf{v}_2 e^{4it} ):begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{4it} = begin{pmatrix} e^{4it}  (i/2) e^{4it}  e^{4it} end{pmatrix}Expressing ( e^{4it} ) as ( cos(4t) + i sin(4t) ), we get:begin{pmatrix} cos(4t) + i sin(4t)  (i/2)(cos(4t) + i sin(4t))  cos(4t) + i sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Simplify the second component:(i/2)cos(4t) + (i^2/2)sin(4t) = (i/2)cos(4t) - (1/2)sin(4t)So, the vector becomes:begin{pmatrix} cos(4t) + i sin(4t)  -frac{1}{2}sin(4t) + frac{i}{2}cos(4t)  cos(4t) + i sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Similarly, for ( mathbf{v}_3 e^{-4it} ):begin{pmatrix} 1  -i/2  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-4it} = begin{pmatrix} cos(4t) - i sin(4t)  -frac{i}{2}cos(4t) - frac{1}{2}sin(4t)  cos(4t) - i sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Now, adding these two solutions together:begin{pmatrix} 2cos(4t)  -sin(4t)  2cos(4t) end{pmatrix}Wait, let me check that:Adding the first components:( [cos(4t) + i sin(4t)] + [cos(4t) - i sin(4t)] = 2cos(4t) )Second components:( [-frac{1}{2}sin(4t) + frac{i}{2}cos(4t)] + [-frac{i}{2}cos(4t) - frac{1}{2}sin(4t)] = -sin(4t) )Third components:( [cos(4t) + i sin(4t)] + [cos(4t) - i sin(4t)] = 2cos(4t) )So, the combined solution from the complex eigenvalues is:begin{pmatrix} 2cos(4t)  -sin(4t)  2cos(4t) end{pmatrix}But wait, I think I might have missed the coefficients. Because originally, the solutions were multiplied by ( C_2 ) and ( C_3 ), which I combined into real and imaginary parts. So, actually, the general solution should include coefficients for both the real and imaginary parts.Let me denote the real solution from the complex eigenvalues as:mathbf{v}_2(t) = begin{pmatrix} 2cos(4t)  -sin(4t)  2cos(4t) end{pmatrix}andmathbf{v}_3(t) = begin{pmatrix} 2sin(4t)  cos(4t)  2sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.When we have complex eigenvalues ( alpha pm beta i ), the solutions can be written as:e^{alpha t} left[ cos(beta t) mathbf{u} - sin(beta t) mathbf{v} right]ande^{alpha t} left[ sin(beta t) mathbf{u} + cos(beta t) mathbf{v} right]where ( mathbf{u} ) and ( mathbf{v} ) are the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvector.In our case, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so ( alpha = 0 ), and ( beta = 4 ).The eigenvector for ( r = 4i ) is ( begin{pmatrix} 1  i/2  1 end{pmatrix} ). So, the real part is ( begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 end{pmatrix} ) and the imaginary part is ( begin{pmatrix} 0  1/2  0 end{pmatrix} ).Therefore, the real solutions are:mathbf{v}_2(t) = cos(4t) begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 end{pmatrix} - sin(4t) begin{pmatrix} 0  1/2  0 end{pmatrix}andmathbf{v}_3(t) = sin(4t) begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 end{pmatrix} + cos(4t) begin{pmatrix} 0  1/2  0 end{pmatrix}Simplifying these:mathbf{v}_2(t) = begin{pmatrix} cos(4t)  -frac{1}{2}sin(4t)  cos(4t) end{pmatrix}andmathbf{v}_3(t) = begin{pmatrix} sin(4t)  frac{1}{2}cos(4t)  sin(4t) end{pmatrix}So, the general solution is a combination of the real eigenvalue solution and these two real solutions from the complex eigenvalues:mathbf{v}(t) = C_1 begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-2t} + C_2 begin{pmatrix} cos(4t)  -frac{1}{2}sin(4t)  cos(4t) end{pmatrix} + C_3 begin{pmatrix} sin(4t)  frac{1}{2}cos(4t)  sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ).At t = 0:mathbf{v}(0) = begin{pmatrix} x(0)  y(0)  z(0) end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} -4  0  1 end{pmatrix}So, substituting t = 0 into the general solution:begin{pmatrix} -4  0  1 end{pmatrix} = C_1 begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{0} + C_2 begin{pmatrix} cos(0)  -frac{1}{2}sin(0)  cos(0) end{pmatrix} + C_3 begin{pmatrix} sin(0)  frac{1}{2}cos(0)  sin(0) end{pmatrix}Simplify the trigonometric functions at t = 0:cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0.So, the equation becomes:begin{pmatrix} -4  0  1 end{pmatrix} = C_1 begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} + C_2 begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 end{pmatrix} + C_3 begin{pmatrix} 0  frac{1}{2}  0 end{pmatrix}This gives us a system of equations:1. ( -4 = -4C_1 + C_2 )2. ( 0 = C_1 + frac{1}{2}C_3 )3. ( 1 = C_1 + C_2 )Now, let's solve this system.From equation 2: ( 0 = C_1 + frac{1}{2}C_3 ) ‚áí ( C_3 = -2C_1 )From equation 1: ( -4 = -4C_1 + C_2 ) ‚áí ( C_2 = -4 + 4C_1 )From equation 3: ( 1 = C_1 + C_2 ) ‚áí Substitute ( C_2 ):( 1 = C_1 + (-4 + 4C_1) ) ‚áí ( 1 = 5C_1 - 4 ) ‚áí ( 5C_1 = 5 ) ‚áí ( C_1 = 1 )Now, substitute ( C_1 = 1 ) into equation 2: ( C_3 = -2(1) = -2 )And substitute ( C_1 = 1 ) into equation 1: ( C_2 = -4 + 4(1) = 0 )So, we have ( C_1 = 1 ), ( C_2 = 0 ), ( C_3 = -2 )Therefore, the particular solution is:mathbf{v}(t) = 1 cdot begin{pmatrix} -4  1  1 end{pmatrix} e^{-2t} + 0 cdot begin{pmatrix} cos(4t)  -frac{1}{2}sin(4t)  cos(4t) end{pmatrix} + (-2) cdot begin{pmatrix} sin(4t)  frac{1}{2}cos(4t)  sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Simplify this:mathbf{v}(t) = begin{pmatrix} -4 e^{-2t}  e^{-2t}  e^{-2t} end{pmatrix} + begin{pmatrix} -2sin(4t)  -cos(4t)  -2sin(4t) end{pmatrix}Combine the components:x(t) = -4 e^{-2t} - 2sin(4t)y(t) = e^{-2t} - cos(4t)z(t) = e^{-2t} - 2sin(4t)Let me double-check these results to ensure they satisfy the initial conditions.At t = 0:( x(0) = -4 e^{0} - 2sin(0) = -4 - 0 = -4 ) ‚úîÔ∏è( y(0) = e^{0} - cos(0) = 1 - 1 = 0 ) ‚úîÔ∏è( z(0) = e^{0} - 2sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1 ) ‚úîÔ∏èGood, the initial conditions are satisfied.Also, let me verify if these solutions satisfy the original differential equations.First, compute ( frac{dx}{dt} ):( frac{dx}{dt} = 8 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t) )But according to the first equation, ( frac{dx}{dt} = 8y = 8(e^{-2t} - cos(4t)) )Which is indeed ( 8 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t) ). So, that's correct.Next, compute ( frac{dy}{dt} ):( frac{dy}{dt} = -2 e^{-2t} + 4sin(4t) )According to the second equation, ( frac{dy}{dt} = -2z = -2(e^{-2t} - 2sin(4t)) = -2 e^{-2t} + 4sin(4t) ). Correct.Finally, compute ( frac{dz}{dt} ):( frac{dz}{dt} = -2 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t) )According to the third equation, ( frac{dz}{dt} = 2x + 8y - 2z )Compute RHS:( 2x = 2(-4 e^{-2t} - 2sin(4t)) = -8 e^{-2t} - 4sin(4t) )( 8y = 8(e^{-2t} - cos(4t)) = 8 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t) )( -2z = -2(e^{-2t} - 2sin(4t)) = -2 e^{-2t} + 4sin(4t) )Add them together:( (-8 e^{-2t} - 4sin(4t)) + (8 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t)) + (-2 e^{-2t} + 4sin(4t)) )Combine like terms:- For ( e^{-2t} ): -8 + 8 - 2 = -2- For ( sin(4t) ): -4 + 4 = 0- For ( cos(4t) ): -8So, total RHS: ( -2 e^{-2t} - 8cos(4t) ), which matches ( frac{dz}{dt} ). Correct.Therefore, the solutions satisfy all the differential equations and the initial conditions. So, I think I've got the correct solution."},{"question":"Given that (a), (b), and (c) are three numbers not equal to 0 and (a : b : c = 6 : 3 : 1).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given three numbers a, b, and c, none of which are zero, and their ratio is 6:3:1. I need to find the value of R, which is defined as 3b¬≤ divided by (2a¬≤ + bc). Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, the ratio a:b:c is 6:3:1. That means a is six times some common factor, b is three times that same factor, and c is just the factor itself. Let me represent this common factor as k. So, I can write:a = 6k  b = 3k  c = kThis makes sense because if I take k as 1, then a is 6, b is 3, and c is 1, which fits the ratio given.

Given the equation ( S_n + S_{n-1} = 3n^2 ), I can substitute ( S_n ) with ( S_{n-1} + a_n ) to get:( (S_{n-1} + a_n) + S_{n-1} = 3n^2 )Simplifying this, I have:( 2S_{n-1} + a_n = 3n^2 )So, ( a_n = 3n^2 - 2S_{n-1} ).Hmm, but I don't know ( S_{n-1} ) directly. Maybe I can find a recursive relation or express ( S_n ) in terms of ( S_{n-1} ).Wait, let's also consider the equation for ( n+1 ):( S_{n+1} + S_n = 3(n+1)^2 )Similarly, ( S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} ), so substituting:( (S_n + a_{n+1}) + S_n = 3(n+1)^2 )Simplifying:( 2S_n + a_{n+1} = 3(n+1)^2 )So, ( a_{n+1} = 3(n+1)^2 - 2S_n )Now, if I subtract the equation for ( a_n ) from this equation, I can get a relation between ( a_{n+1} ) and ( a_n ):( a_{n+1} - a_n = [3(n+1)^2 - 2S_n] - [3n^2 - 2S_{n-1}] )Simplify this:( a_{n+1} - a_n = 3(n^2 + 2n + 1) - 3n^2 - 2S_n + 2S_{n-1} )Simplify further:( a_{n+1} - a_n = 3(2n + 1) - 2(S_n - S_{n-1}) )But ( S_n - S_{n-1} = a_n ), so:( a_{n+1} - a_n = 6n + 3 - 2a_n )Rearranging:( a_{n+1} = 6n + 3 - 2a_n + a_n )Wait, that simplifies to:( a_{n+1} = 6n + 3 - a_n )So, ( a_{n+1} + a_n = 6n + 3 )That's a useful recursive relation. So, each term plus the next term equals ( 6n + 3 ). Maybe I can use this to express ( a_n ) in terms of ( a_1 ).But before that, let me check for ( n = 2 ). Since the equation ( S_n + S_{n-1} = 3n^2 ) holds for ( n geq 2 ), let's plug in ( n = 2 ):( S_2 + S_1 = 3(2)^2 = 12 )But ( S_1 = a_1 = a ), and ( S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = a + a_2 ). So:( (a + a_2) + a = 12 )Which simplifies to:( 2a + a_2 = 12 )Therefore, ( a_2 = 12 - 2a )Okay, so ( a_2 ) is expressed in terms of ( a ). Now, using the recursive relation ( a_{n+1} + a_n = 6n + 3 ), let's compute ( a_3 ):For ( n = 2 ):( a_3 + a_2 = 6(2) + 3 = 15 )We know ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ), so:( a_3 = 15 - a_2 = 15 - (12 - 2a) = 3 + 2a )Similarly, for ( n = 3 ):( a_4 + a_3 = 6(3) + 3 = 21 )So, ( a_4 = 21 - a_3 = 21 - (3 + 2a) = 18 - 2a )Continuing, for ( n = 4 ):( a_5 + a_4 = 6(4) + 3 = 27 )Thus, ( a_5 = 27 - a_4 = 27 - (18 - 2a) = 9 + 2a )Hmm, I notice a pattern here. Let me list out the terms:- ( a_1 = a )- ( a_2 = 12 - 2a )- ( a_3 = 3 + 2a )- ( a_4 = 18 - 2a )- ( a_5 = 9 + 2a )- ...It seems like the terms alternate between expressions involving ( a ) and constants. Maybe I can find a general formula for ( a_n ).Looking at the recursive relation ( a_{n+1} + a_n = 6n + 3 ), this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.First, write the recurrence as:( a_{n+1} = -a_n + 6n + 3 )This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.The homogeneous equation is ( a_{n+1} = -a_n ), which has the solution ( a_n^{(h)} = C(-1)^n ), where ( C ) is a constant.Now, find a particular solution ( a_n^{(p)} ). Since the nonhomogeneous term is linear in ( n ), let's assume a particular solution of the form ( a_n^{(p)} = An + B ).Substitute into the recurrence:( a_{n+1}^{(p)} = -a_n^{(p)} + 6n + 3 )Left-hand side:( a_{n+1}^{(p)} = A(n+1) + B = An + A + B )Right-hand side:( -a_n^{(p)} + 6n + 3 = -(An + B) + 6n + 3 = (-A + 6)n + (-B + 3) )Set coefficients equal:For ( n ):( A = -A + 6 ) => ( 2A = 6 ) => ( A = 3 )For constants:( A + B = -B + 3 )We know ( A = 3 ), so:( 3 + B = -B + 3 )Bring ( B ) terms to one side:( 3 + B + B = 3 )( 3 + 2B = 3 )Subtract 3:( 2B = 0 ) => ( B = 0 )So, the particular solution is ( a_n^{(p)} = 3n ).Therefore, the general solution is:( a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C(-1)^n + 3n )Now, apply the initial condition to find ( C ). Wait, but we have ( a_1 = a ). Let's plug ( n = 1 ):( a_1 = C(-1)^1 + 3(1) = -C + 3 = a )So, ( -C + 3 = a ) => ( C = 3 - a )Therefore, the general term is:( a_n = (3 - a)(-1)^n + 3n )Let me verify this with the terms I calculated earlier.For ( n = 1 ):( a_1 = (3 - a)(-1)^1 + 3(1) = -(3 - a) + 3 = -3 + a + 3 = a ) Correct.For ( n = 2 ):( a_2 = (3 - a)(-1)^2 + 3(2) = (3 - a)(1) + 6 = 3 - a + 6 = 9 - a )Wait, but earlier I found ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ). Hmm, discrepancy here. Let me check my calculations.Wait, no, when I computed ( a_2 ), I had:From ( S_2 + S_1 = 12 ), ( 2a + a_2 = 12 ), so ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ). But according to the general formula, ( a_2 = 9 - a ). So, equate them:( 9 - a = 12 - 2a )Solving:( 9 - a = 12 - 2a )Add ( 2a ) to both sides:( 9 + a = 12 )Subtract 9:( a = 3 )Wait, that suggests that ( a = 3 ). But in the problem, ( a ) is a variable, so this seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake in deriving the general solution.Wait, let's go back. The recurrence relation is ( a_{n+1} = -a_n + 6n + 3 ). I assumed a particular solution of the form ( An + B ), which led to ( A = 3 ), ( B = 0 ). So, the particular solution is ( 3n ). Then, the homogeneous solution is ( C(-1)^n ). So, the general solution is ( a_n = C(-1)^n + 3n ).But when I plug ( n = 1 ), I get ( a_1 = -C + 3 = a ), so ( C = 3 - a ). Then, ( a_n = (3 - a)(-1)^n + 3n ).But when ( n = 2 ), ( a_2 = (3 - a)(1) + 6 = 9 - a ). But earlier, from the sum, ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ). So, equating:( 9 - a = 12 - 2a )Which gives ( a = 3 ). So, this suggests that if ( a = 3 ), then the general formula works. But in the problem, ( a ) is a variable, so perhaps my approach is missing something.Wait, maybe the recurrence relation is valid for ( n geq 2 ), not for ( n = 1 ). Because the original equation ( S_n + S_{n-1} = 3n^2 ) is given for ( n geq 2 ). So, the recurrence ( a_{n+1} + a_n = 6n + 3 ) is valid for ( n geq 2 ), meaning that ( a_3 + a_2 = 15 ), ( a_4 + a_3 = 21 ), etc.Therefore, the general solution I found applies for ( n geq 2 ), but the initial terms ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are determined separately.So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let me consider that the recurrence ( a_{n+1} + a_n = 6n + 3 ) is valid for ( n geq 2 ). Therefore, for ( n geq 2 ), the solution is ( a_n = C(-1)^n + 3n ).But for ( n = 2 ), let's use the expression ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ). So, plug ( n = 2 ) into the general solution:( a_2 = C(-1)^2 + 3(2) = C + 6 )But ( a_2 = 12 - 2a ), so:( C + 6 = 12 - 2a )Thus, ( C = 6 - 2a )Therefore, the general term for ( n geq 2 ) is:( a_n = (6 - 2a)(-1)^n + 3n )Wait, but for ( n = 3 ), using the recurrence:( a_3 = 15 - a_2 = 15 - (12 - 2a) = 3 + 2a )Using the general formula:( a_3 = (6 - 2a)(-1)^3 + 3(3) = -(6 - 2a) + 9 = -6 + 2a + 9 = 3 + 2a )Which matches. Similarly, for ( n = 4 ):( a_4 = 21 - a_3 = 21 - (3 + 2a) = 18 - 2a )Using the general formula:( a_4 = (6 - 2a)(-1)^4 + 3(4) = (6 - 2a) + 12 = 18 - 2a )Which also matches. So, the general formula for ( n geq 2 ) is:( a_n = (6 - 2a)(-1)^n + 3n )But for ( n = 1 ), we have ( a_1 = a ), which is separate.So, now, the problem states that ( a_n < a_{n+1} ) for any ( n in mathbb{N}^* ). That is, the sequence is strictly increasing. So, we need to ensure that ( a_{n+1} - a_n > 0 ) for all ( n geq 1 ).Let's compute ( a_{n+1} - a_n ) for ( n geq 2 ), since for ( n = 1 ), we can compute it separately.First, for ( n = 1 ):( a_2 - a_1 = (12 - 2a) - a = 12 - 3a )We need ( a_2 - a_1 > 0 ):( 12 - 3a > 0 ) => ( 12 > 3a ) => ( a < 4 )So, ( a < 4 ) is one condition.Now, for ( n geq 2 ), using the general formula:( a_{n+1} - a_n = [ (6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} + 3(n+1) ] - [ (6 - 2a)(-1)^n + 3n ] )Simplify:( a_{n+1} - a_n = (6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} - (6 - 2a)(-1)^n + 3(n+1) - 3n )Factor out ( (6 - 2a)(-1)^n ):( = (6 - 2a)(-1)^n [ -1 - 1 ] + 3 )Simplify:( = (6 - 2a)(-1)^n (-2) + 3 )( = 2(6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} + 3 )So, ( a_{n+1} - a_n = 3 + 2(6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} )We need this to be greater than 0 for all ( n geq 2 ).So, ( 3 + 2(6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} > 0 )Let me write this as:( 3 + 2(6 - 2a)(-1)^{n+1} > 0 )Let me denote ( k = n+1 ), so for ( n geq 2 ), ( k geq 3 ). But maybe it's better to consider the cases when ( n ) is even and odd.Let me separate into two cases:Case 1: ( n ) is even. Let ( n = 2m ) where ( m geq 1 ). Then ( n+1 = 2m + 1 ), which is odd.So, ( (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{2m + 1} = -1 )Thus, the inequality becomes:( 3 + 2(6 - 2a)(-1) > 0 )Simplify:( 3 - 2(6 - 2a) > 0 )( 3 - 12 + 4a > 0 )( -9 + 4a > 0 )( 4a > 9 )( a > frac{9}{4} )Case 2: ( n ) is odd. Let ( n = 2m - 1 ) where ( m geq 2 ). Then ( n+1 = 2m ), which is even.So, ( (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{2m} = 1 )Thus, the inequality becomes:( 3 + 2(6 - 2a)(1) > 0 )Simplify:( 3 + 12 - 4a > 0 )( 15 - 4a > 0 )( -4a > -15 )Multiply both sides by (-1), inequality flips:( 4a < 15 )( a < frac{15}{4} )So, combining both cases, for ( n geq 2 ), we have ( frac{9}{4} < a < frac{15}{4} ).But we also have the condition from ( n = 1 ), which is ( a < 4 ). So, combining all conditions:( frac{9}{4} < a < frac{15}{4} )Because ( frac{15}{4} = 3.75 ) is less than 4, so the stricter upper bound is ( frac{15}{4} ).Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( left( frac{9}{4}, frac{15}{4} right) ).Let me just verify this with the initial terms.If ( a = frac{9}{4} ), then ( a_2 = 12 - 2a = 12 - frac{9}{2} = frac{15}{2} = 7.5 ). Then ( a_3 = 3 + 2a = 3 + frac{9}{2} = frac{15}{2} = 7.5 ). So, ( a_2 = a_3 ), which violates the strictly increasing condition. So, ( a ) must be greater than ( frac{9}{4} ).Similarly, if ( a = frac{15}{4} ), then ( a_2 = 12 - 2a = 12 - frac{15}{2} = frac{9}{2} = 4.5 ). Then ( a_3 = 3 + 2a = 3 + frac{15}{2} = frac{21}{2} = 10.5 ). Then ( a_4 = 18 - 2a = 18 - frac{15}{2} = frac{21}{2} = 10.5 ). So, ( a_3 = a_4 ), which again violates the strictly increasing condition. So, ( a ) must be less than ( frac{15}{4} ).Therefore, the range is indeed ( left( frac{9}{4}, frac{15}{4} right) )."},{"question":"Evaluate ( x^{(x^x)} ) at ( x = 3 ).text{(A)}  3^{27} qquad  text{(B)}  3^{9} qquad  text{(C)}  3^{81} qquad  text{(D)}  3^{243} qquad  text{(E)}  3^{729}","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the expression ( x^{(x^x)} ) at ( x = 3 ).To do this, I'll start by calculating the inner exponent ( x^x ) when ( x = 3 ).

Point (O) on side (ST) is such that angle (OQT) equals the sum of angles (QTS) and (QST). Prove that (OM) is the angle bisector of angle (QOT).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. We have a triangle SQT, and SM is the angle bisector. That means point M is somewhere on side QT, right? Because an angle bisector in a triangle splits the angle into two equal parts. So, SM divides angle S into two equal angles. Now, there's a point O on side ST. The condition given is that angle OQT is equal to the sum of angles QTS and QST. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me write that down:‚à†OQT = ‚à†QTS + ‚à†QSTI need to visualize this. Let me sketch triangle SQT. Let me label the vertices S, Q, and T. SM is the angle bisector, so M is on QT. Point O is somewhere on ST. So, angle OQT is at point Q, between O and T. Angles QTS and QST are at points T and S respectively. So, angle QTS is at T, between Q and S, and angle QST is at S, between Q and T. Wait, angle QST is at S, so that's the same as angle QST in triangle SQT. Similarly, angle QTS is at T, so that's angle QTS in triangle SQT. So, the sum of angles QTS and QST is equal to angle OQT. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in a triangle, the sum of two angles is equal to 180 minus the third angle. So, in triangle SQT, the sum of angles at S and T is equal to 180 minus angle at Q. But here, angle OQT is given as the sum of angles QTS and QST. So, angle OQT = angle QTS + angle QST. Wait, angle QTS is angle at T, and angle QST is angle at S. So, angle OQT is equal to the sum of angles at S and T in triangle SQT. But in triangle SQT, the sum of angles at S and T is 180 - angle at Q. So, angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT. Wait, angle SQT is the angle at Q in triangle SQT. So, angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT. But angle OQT is an angle at Q, so if angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT, that would mean that angle OQT is supplementary to angle SQT. But in triangle SQT, angle SQT is one of the angles, so it's less than 180 degrees. Therefore, angle OQT is greater than 0 and less than 180. Wait, but if angle OQT is supplementary to angle SQT, that would mean that points O, Q, and T are colinear? But O is on ST, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Wait, no. Let me think again. Angle OQT is at point Q, between points O and T. So, it's the angle formed at Q by lines QO and QT. Similarly, angle QTS is at point T, between Q and S, and angle QST is at point S, between Q and T. So, angle OQT is equal to the sum of angles QTS and QST. Let me denote the angles:Let‚Äôs let angle QST = Œ± and angle QTS = Œ≤. Then, angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤.In triangle SQT, the sum of angles is 180 degrees, so angle SQT + Œ± + Œ≤ = 180. Therefore, angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤.But angle OQT is given as Œ± + Œ≤, so angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT.Wait, that's interesting. So, angle OQT + angle SQT = 180 degrees. That would mean that points O, Q, and T are colinear? But O is on ST, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.Wait, no. Let me think again. If angle OQT is equal to the sum of angles QTS and QST, which are angles at T and S respectively, then angle OQT is equal to 180 - angle SQT.But angle OQT is an angle at Q, so how can it be equal to 180 - angle SQT? Unless point O is such that line QO is extending beyond Q, making angle OQT supplementary to angle SQT.Wait, maybe point O is not between S and T, but beyond T? But the problem says point O is on side ST, so it must be between S and T. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps I should consider the external angle at Q. If I extend TQ beyond Q to a point, say, K, then the external angle at Q would be equal to the sum of the opposite internal angles, which are angles QTS and QST. So, angle SQK = angle QTS + angle QST.But in the problem, angle OQT is equal to angle QTS + angle QST. So, angle OQT = angle SQK.Therefore, angle OQT is equal to the external angle at Q, which is angle SQK. But angle SQK is equal to angle OQT, which is the angle inside triangle QOT at point Q. Hmm, that seems contradictory because angle SQK is an external angle, while angle OQT is an internal angle.Wait, maybe point O is such that line QO is parallel to some line? Or maybe triangle QOT is similar to another triangle?Alternatively, perhaps I can use the angle bisector theorem since SM is the angle bisector. The angle bisector theorem states that SM divides QT into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, QS/QT = SM/MT or something like that.Wait, no, the angle bisector theorem states that QS/QT = SM/MT. Wait, no, more precisely, if SM is the angle bisector of angle S in triangle SQT, then QS/QT = MS/MT.Wait, let me recall the angle bisector theorem correctly. It states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle SQT, angle bisector SM divides side QT into segments QM and MT such that QS/QT = QM/MT.Wait, no, more accurately, QS/QT = QM/MT. Wait, no, that's not correct. The angle bisector theorem states that QS/QT = SM/MT. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the sides.Wait, let me think again. In triangle ABC, if AD is the angle bisector of angle A, then AB/AC = BD/DC. So, in our case, triangle SQT, angle bisector SM. So, angle at S is being bisected, so the sides adjacent to angle S are SQ and ST. So, the angle bisector SM divides side QT into segments QM and MT such that SQ/ST = QM/MT.Yes, that's correct. So, SQ/ST = QM/MT.Okay, so that's a property we can use.Now, back to point O. We have angle OQT = angle QTS + angle QST. As I thought earlier, angle OQT = angle SQK, where K is a point on the extension of TQ beyond Q.So, angle OQT is equal to the external angle at Q, which is equal to the sum of the opposite internal angles.Therefore, angle OQT = angle SQK.But angle SQK is an external angle, while angle OQT is an internal angle at Q in triangle QOT.Wait, perhaps we can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or something like that.Alternatively, maybe we can use trigonometric identities or the law of sines or cosines.Alternatively, since we have an angle bisector, maybe we can use the angle bisector theorem in triangle QOT to show that OM is the angle bisector.Wait, the problem is to prove that OM is the angle bisector of angle QOT.So, in triangle QOT, we need to show that OM bisects angle QOT.So, if we can show that the ratio of the sides QO/OT is equal to the ratio of the segments created by OM on side QT, then by the converse of the angle bisector theorem, OM would be the angle bisector.Alternatively, if we can show that the angles formed by OM with QO and OT are equal, then OM is the angle bisector.So, perhaps we can use the given condition angle OQT = angle QTS + angle QST to find some relationships.Let me denote angle QST as Œ± and angle QTS as Œ≤. So, angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤.In triangle SQT, the sum of angles is 180, so angle SQT + Œ± + Œ≤ = 180. Therefore, angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤.But angle OQT is given as Œ± + Œ≤, so angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT.Wait, that's interesting. So, angle OQT + angle SQT = 180 degrees. That suggests that points O, Q, and T are colinear, but that can't be because O is on ST.Wait, maybe I'm misapplying something here. Let me think again.If angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤, and in triangle SQT, angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤, then angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT.But angle OQT is at point Q, between O and T, and angle SQT is at point Q, between S and T.So, if angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT, that would mean that lines QO and QS are forming a straight line? Because the angles at Q would add up to 180.Wait, that would mean that point O is such that QO is the extension of QS beyond S. But O is on ST, so that can't be unless O is at S, but O is on ST, so maybe O is beyond S? But the problem says O is on side ST, so it must be between S and T.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can use Ceva's theorem. Ceva's theorem relates the ratios of the segments when concurrent lines are drawn from the vertices of a triangle.But in this case, we have point O on ST, and we might consider lines from Q and S.Wait, Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent lines from vertices, the product of the ratios is equal to 1.But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the trigonometric form of Ceva's theorem, which involves angles.Wait, the trigonometric Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent lines from the vertices, the product of the sines of the angles is equal.But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines in triangles QOT and SQT.Let me consider triangle QOT. In triangle QOT, we have angle at Q is angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤, angle at T is angle QTO, and angle at O is angle QOT.Similarly, in triangle SQT, we have angles at S, Q, and T as Œ±, angle SQT, and Œ≤ respectively.Wait, perhaps I can express some ratios using the Law of Sines.In triangle QOT, by the Law of Sines:QO / sin(angle QTO) = OT / sin(angle OQT) = QT / sin(angle QOT)Similarly, in triangle SQT:SQ / sin(Œ≤) = ST / sin(angle SQT) = QT / sin(Œ±)But I'm not sure how to connect these.Wait, maybe I can relate angles in triangle QOT with those in triangle SQT.Given that angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤, and angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤, as we saw earlier.So, angle OQT = 180 - angle SQT.But angle OQT is an internal angle in triangle QOT, so it's less than 180. Therefore, angle SQT must be greater than 0, which it is.Hmm, maybe I can consider triangle QOT and triangle SQK, where K is a point such that angle SQK = angle OQT.Wait, earlier I thought that angle OQT = angle SQK, where K is on the extension of TQ beyond Q.So, maybe triangles QOT and SQK are similar?Wait, let me see. If angle OQT = angle SQK, and both triangles share angle at Q, then maybe they are similar.Wait, in triangle QOT and triangle SQK, angle at Q is common, and angle OQT = angle SQK. Therefore, by AA similarity, triangles QOT and SQK are similar.If that's the case, then the sides are proportional.So, QO / SQ = OT / SK = QT / QKBut I'm not sure if this helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can use this similarity to find some proportional segments.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.Let me go back to the angle bisector SM. Since SM is the angle bisector of angle S in triangle SQT, by the angle bisector theorem, we have:QS / ST = QM / MTSo, QS / ST = QM / MTThat's one relationship.Now, we need to relate this to point O on ST such that angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤.Hmm.Wait, perhaps I can consider triangle QOT and use the angle bisector theorem there.If we can show that OM divides angle QOT into two equal angles, then OM is the angle bisector.Alternatively, if we can show that the ratio of QO / OT is equal to the ratio of QM / MT, then by the converse of the angle bisector theorem, OM would be the angle bisector.So, if we can show that QO / OT = QM / MT, then OM is the angle bisector.But how can we show that?Well, from the angle bisector theorem in triangle SQT, we have QS / ST = QM / MT.So, if we can show that QO / OT = QS / ST, then we can equate QO / OT = QM / MT, which would give us the desired result.So, let's try to find QO / OT.In triangle QOT, by the Law of Sines:QO / sin(angle QTO) = OT / sin(angle OQT) = QT / sin(angle QOT)Similarly, in triangle SQT, by the Law of Sines:SQ / sin(Œ≤) = ST / sin(angle SQT) = QT / sin(Œ±)So, from triangle SQT:SQ / sin(Œ≤) = ST / sin(angle SQT)Therefore, SQ / ST = sin(Œ≤) / sin(angle SQT)But angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤, so sin(angle SQT) = sin(Œ± + Œ≤)Therefore, SQ / ST = sin(Œ≤) / sin(Œ± + Œ≤)Similarly, in triangle QOT:QO / sin(angle QTO) = OT / sin(angle OQT)But angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤, and angle QTO is angle at T in triangle QOT.Wait, angle QTO is the same as angle QTS, which is Œ≤, right?Wait, no. In triangle QOT, angle at T is angle QTO, which is different from angle QTS in triangle SQT.Wait, angle QTS is at point T in triangle SQT, which is angle between QT and ST.In triangle QOT, angle at T is angle QTO, which is between QT and OT.But since O is on ST, angle QTO is the same as angle QTS, because both are angles at T between QT and ST (or OT, which is part of ST).Wait, no. Because O is on ST, so OT is a segment of ST. Therefore, angle QTO is the same as angle QTS.Wait, yes, because at point T, the angle between QT and ST is the same as the angle between QT and OT, since OT is part of ST.Therefore, angle QTO = angle QTS = Œ≤.So, in triangle QOT, angle QTO = Œ≤, angle OQT = Œ± + Œ≤, so angle QOT = 180 - Œ≤ - (Œ± + Œ≤) = 180 - Œ± - 2Œ≤.Wait, but in triangle SQT, angle SQT = 180 - Œ± - Œ≤.So, angle QOT = 180 - Œ± - 2Œ≤, which is different from angle SQT.Hmm.Now, back to the Law of Sines in triangle QOT:QO / sin(Œ≤) = OT / sin(Œ± + Œ≤)Therefore, QO / OT = sin(Œ≤) / sin(Œ± + Œ≤)Similarly, from triangle SQT, we have SQ / ST = sin(Œ≤) / sin(Œ± + Œ≤)Therefore, QO / OT = SQ / STSo, QO / OT = SQ / STBut from the angle bisector theorem in triangle SQT, we have SQ / ST = QM / MTTherefore, QO / OT = QM / MTWhich is exactly the condition needed for OM to be the angle bisector of angle QOT in triangle QOT.Therefore, by the converse of the angle bisector theorem, OM is the angle bisector of angle QOT.So, that's the proof.**Final Answer**boxed{OM text{ is the angle bisector of } angle QOT}"},{"question":"Which of the following expressions is a quadratic radical?A: frac{1}{2}aB: sqrt[3]{33}C: sqrt{-1}D: sqrt{1+a^{2}}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here asking me which of the given expressions is a quadratic radical. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me try to understand what a quadratic radical is first. From what I remember, a quadratic radical involves a square root, right? So, it's something like ‚àö(something), where \\"something\\" is usually a quadratic expression, meaning it has a squared term.Alright, let's go through each option one by one.**Option A: (1/2)a**Hmm, this is just a linear expression. It's half of 'a'. There's no square root here, so it doesn't seem like a quadratic radical. Quadratic radicals involve square roots, and this is just a simple multiplication. So, I think A is not the answer.**Option B: ‚àõ33**This is the cube root of 33. Wait, isn't that different from a square root? Yeah, cube roots are third roots, not square roots. So, since it's not a square root, it's not a quadratic radical either. So, B is out.**Option C: ‚àö-1**Okay, this is the square root of negative one. I remember that the square root of a negative number isn't a real number; it's an imaginary number, denoted by 'i'. But the problem doesn't specify whether we're dealing with real numbers or not. If we're only considering real numbers, then ‚àö-1 isn't a real number, so it might not qualify. But if we're including complex numbers, then it is a square root. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Maybe I should come back to it after looking at the last option.**Option D: ‚àö(1 + a¬≤)**This is the square root of (1 plus a squared). So, inside the square root, we have a quadratic expression because of the 'a squared' term. That fits the definition of a quadratic radical since it's a square root of a quadratic expression. Plus, since 'a squared' is always non-negative, adding 1 ensures that the expression inside the square root is always positive, making it a valid real number expression.Going back to option C, since the problem doesn't specify, but usually when talking about radicals in basic algebra, we're referring to real numbers. So, ‚àö-1 might not be considered a valid quadratic radical in this context. Therefore, D seems to be the correct answer.Wait, let me double-check. Quadratic radical specifically refers to square roots of quadratic expressions, right? So, D definitely fits that. A is linear, B is a cube root, and C is an imaginary number. Yeah, D is the one that matches the definition.I think I've got it now. The answer should be D."},{"question":"Jenny and Mark are throwing bottle caps. Jenny's bottlecap flies some distance straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went. Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. Mark's bottle cap went 21 feet further than Jenny's. How far did Jenny's bottle cap fly straight?","answer":"First, I need to determine how far Jenny's bottle cap flew straight before bouncing off the street light. Let's denote this distance as ( x ) feet.After bouncing off the street light, Jenny's bottle cap flies an additional ( frac{1}{3} ) of the initial distance, which is ( frac{1}{3}x ) feet. Therefore, the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled is:[x + frac{1}{3}x = frac{4}{3}x text{ feet}]Next, I'll calculate the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled. Mark's bottle cap flew 15 feet straight, then bounced off a window and flew twice that distance, which is:[2 times 15 = 30 text{ feet}]So, the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled is:[15 + 30 = 45 text{ feet}]According to the problem, Mark's bottle cap went 21 feet further than Jenny's. This gives us the equation:[frac{4}{3}x + 21 = 45]To solve for ( x ), I'll first subtract 21 from both sides of the equation:[frac{4}{3}x = 24]Next, I'll multiply both sides by ( frac{3}{4} ) to isolate ( x ):[x = 24 times frac{3}{4} = 18]Therefore, Jenny's bottle cap flew straight for 18 feet before bouncing off the street light."},{"question":"The sum of the minimum and maximum values of the function f(x) = cos 2x + 2sin x is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = cos(2x) + 2 sin x, and I need to find the sum of its minimum and maximum values. Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that trigonometric functions can sometimes be simplified using identities. The function has both cos(2x) and sin x terms. I think there's an identity that can help me rewrite cos(2x) in terms of sin x. Let me recall... Oh yeah, the double-angle identity! Cos(2x) can be written as 1 - 2 sin¬≤x. So, substituting that into the function, I get:f(x) = 1 - 2 sin¬≤x + 2 sin x.Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of sin x. If I let y = sin x, then the function becomes:f(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1.Okay, so now it's a quadratic function in y. Quadratic functions have a maximum or minimum value at their vertex. Since the coefficient of y¬≤ is negative (-2), this parabola opens downward, meaning it has a maximum point. But wait, I need both the maximum and minimum values of f(x). Since y = sin x is bounded between -1 and 1, I can find the maximum and minimum of this quadratic within that interval.Let me write the quadratic function again:f(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1.To find the vertex of this parabola, I can use the formula for the vertex of a quadratic function, which is at y = -b/(2a). Here, a = -2 and b = 2, so:y = -2/(2*(-2)) = -2/(-4) = 0.5.So, the vertex is at y = 0.5. Since the parabola opens downward, this is the maximum point. Let me calculate f(0.5):f(0.5) = -2*(0.5)¬≤ + 2*(0.5) + 1 = -2*(0.25) + 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1 + 1 = 1.5.So, the maximum value of f(x) is 1.5.Now, to find the minimum value, since the parabola opens downward, the minimums will occur at the endpoints of the interval for y, which is between -1 and 1. So, I need to evaluate f(y) at y = -1 and y = 1 and see which one is smaller.First, let's compute f(1):f(1) = -2*(1)¬≤ + 2*(1) + 1 = -2 + 2 + 1 = 1.Next, compute f(-1):f(-1) = -2*(-1)¬≤ + 2*(-1) + 1 = -2*(1) - 2 + 1 = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3.So, f(-1) is -3, which is less than f(1) which is 1. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is -3.Now, the question asks for the sum of the minimum and maximum values. So, adding them together:1.5 + (-3) = -1.5.Wait, that's negative. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the quadratic function: f(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1. The vertex at y = 0.5 gives f(0.5) = 1.5, which seems correct.Then, evaluating at y = 1: f(1) = -2 + 2 + 1 = 1. That's correct.Evaluating at y = -1: f(-1) = -2*(1) + (-2) + 1 = -2 -2 +1 = -3. That's also correct.So, the maximum is 1.5 and the minimum is -3. Their sum is indeed -1.5.But wait, the problem says \\"the sum of the minimum and maximum values.\\" So, 1.5 + (-3) is -1.5, which is equal to -3/2. So, in fraction form, that's -3/2.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using calculus to find the critical points?Let me try that method to verify.First, find the derivative of f(x):f(x) = cos(2x) + 2 sin x.f'(x) = -2 sin(2x) + 2 cos x.Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:-2 sin(2x) + 2 cos x = 0.Divide both sides by 2:-sin(2x) + cos x = 0.Recall that sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x, so substitute:-2 sin x cos x + cos x = 0.Factor out cos x:cos x (-2 sin x + 1) = 0.So, either cos x = 0 or -2 sin x + 1 = 0.Case 1: cos x = 0.This occurs at x = œÄ/2 + kœÄ, where k is any integer.Case 2: -2 sin x + 1 = 0.Solving for sin x:sin x = 1/2.So, x = œÄ/6 + 2kœÄ or x = 5œÄ/6 + 2kœÄ.Now, let's evaluate f(x) at these critical points.First, for cos x = 0, which is at x = œÄ/2 + kœÄ.Let's take x = œÄ/2:f(œÄ/2) = cos(2*(œÄ/2)) + 2 sin(œÄ/2) = cos(œÄ) + 2*1 = -1 + 2 = 1.Next, x = 3œÄ/2:f(3œÄ/2) = cos(2*(3œÄ/2)) + 2 sin(3œÄ/2) = cos(3œÄ) + 2*(-1) = -1 - 2 = -3.So, at x = œÄ/2, f(x) = 1; at x = 3œÄ/2, f(x) = -3.Now, for sin x = 1/2, which occurs at x = œÄ/6 and 5œÄ/6.Compute f(œÄ/6):f(œÄ/6) = cos(2*(œÄ/6)) + 2 sin(œÄ/6) = cos(œÄ/3) + 2*(1/2) = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5.Compute f(5œÄ/6):f(5œÄ/6) = cos(2*(5œÄ/6)) + 2 sin(5œÄ/6) = cos(5œÄ/3) + 2*(1/2) = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5.So, both x = œÄ/6 and x = 5œÄ/6 give f(x) = 1.5.Therefore, the critical points give us f(x) values of 1.5, 1, and -3.So, the maximum value is 1.5, and the minimum value is -3. Their sum is 1.5 + (-3) = -1.5, which is -3/2.So, both methods give the same result. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.Wait, just to be thorough, should I check other points? For example, what happens at x = 0?f(0) = cos(0) + 2 sin(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.At x = œÄ:f(œÄ) = cos(2œÄ) + 2 sin œÄ = 1 + 0 = 1.So, those points give f(x) = 1, which is consistent with the critical points we found earlier.Therefore, I think I've covered all possible critical points and endpoints. The maximum is indeed 1.5, and the minimum is -3. Their sum is -1.5.I think that's the answer. It seems consistent across both the algebraic method and calculus method. So, I'm pretty sure the sum of the minimum and maximum values is -3/2.**Final Answer**The sum of the minimum and maximum values of the function is boxed{-dfrac{3}{2}}."},{"question":"A can complete a task in 15 days, B can complete the same task in 20 days, and C can complete the task in 25 days. A and B start working on the first task together, while C begins working on a second task. After 7 days, A and B switch to help C with the second task. What is the fraction of the work left to be done for each task after 14 days?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where A, B, and C can complete a task individually in 15, 20, and 25 days respectively. A and B start working on the first task together, while C starts on a second task. After 7 days, A and B switch to help C with the second task. I need to find the fraction of work left for each task after 14 days.First, I think I need to figure out how much work A and B can do together on the first task in those initial 7 days. Since A can finish the task in 15 days, A's work rate is 1/15 per day. Similarly, B's work rate is 1/20 per day. So together, their combined work rate should be 1/15 + 1/20. Let me calculate that:1/15 is approximately 0.0667, and 1/20 is 0.05. Adding them together gives 0.1167 per day. To be exact, 1/15 + 1/20 is 4/60 + 3/60 = 7/60 per day. So in 7 days, they would complete 7 * 7/60 = 49/60 of the first task. That means the remaining work on the first task is 1 - 49/60 = 11/60.Now, for the second task, C is working alone initially. C's work rate is 1/25 per day. In 7 days, C completes 7 * 1/25 = 7/25 of the second task. So the remaining work on the second task is 1 - 7/25 = 18/25.After 7 days, A and B switch to help C with the second task. Now, all three are working on the second task. Their combined work rate is 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25. Let me calculate that:1/15 is 4/60, 1/20 is 3/60, and 1/25 is 2.4/60. Adding them together: 4/60 + 3/60 + 2.4/60 = 9.4/60 per day. So, their combined work rate is 9.4/60 per day.Now, they have 7 more days to work on the second task. The remaining work is 18/25, which is 0.72. Let me see how much they can complete in 7 days:7 * 9.4/60 = 65.8/60 ‚âà 1.097. Wait, that's more than 1, which means they can finish the task before the 7 days are up. So, I need to find out exactly how much time they need to finish the remaining 18/25.Time = Work / Rate = (18/25) / (9.4/60) = (18/25) * (60/9.4) ‚âà (0.72) * (6.383) ‚âà 4.36 days. So, they finish the second task in about 4.36 days, leaving 7 - 4.36 ‚âà 2.64 days unused.Therefore, after 14 days, the first task still has 11/60 left, and the second task is completed, so nothing left there.I think that's the solution, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes."},{"question":"While playing a game, Kaleb had ninety-eight lives.

The problem gives me a recurrence relation for {a_n}: 2a_{n+1} + a_n = 3 for n ‚â• 1, and the initial term a_1 = 10. Then, it defines {b_n} as b_n = a_n - 1. I need to find the smallest integer n such that the absolute value of S_n - 6 is less than 1/170, where S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}.First, I should probably figure out what the sequence {a_n} looks like. The recurrence relation is 2a_{n+1} + a_n = 3. Let me rearrange that to solve for a_{n+1}:2a_{n+1} = -a_n + 3  a_{n+1} = (-a_n + 3)/2So, each term is half of (3 - a_n). That seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe it's a geometric sequence? Let me check.Given that a_{n+1} = (-1/2)a_n + 3/2, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.The homogeneous part is a_{n+1} = (-1/2)a_n. The characteristic equation is r = -1/2, so the homogeneous solution is A*(-1/2)^n.For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3/2), I can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:a_p = (-1/2)a_p + 3/2  a_p + (1/2)a_p = 3/2  (3/2)a_p = 3/2  a_p = 1So, the general solution is a_n = A*(-1/2)^n + 1.Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 10:10 = A*(-1/2)^1 + 1  10 = -A/2 + 1  -A/2 = 9  A = -18So, the explicit formula for a_n is:a_n = -18*(-1/2)^n + 1  Simplify that:  a_n = 1 - 18*(-1/2)^nOkay, so now {b_n} = a_n - 1, which would be:b_n = (1 - 18*(-1/2)^n) - 1  b_n = -18*(-1/2)^nSo, {b_n} is a geometric sequence with first term b_1 = -18*(-1/2)^1 = 9, and common ratio r = -1/2.Now, S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}. The sum of a geometric series is S_n = b_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r).Plugging in the values:S_n = 9*(1 - (-1/2)^n)/(1 - (-1/2))  Simplify the denominator: 1 - (-1/2) = 3/2  So, S_n = 9*(1 - (-1/2)^n)/(3/2) = 9*(2/3)*(1 - (-1/2)^n) = 6*(1 - (-1/2)^n)Therefore, S_n = 6 - 6*(-1/2)^nNow, the problem asks for the smallest integer n such that |S_n - 6| < 1/170.Let's compute |S_n - 6|:|S_n - 6| = |6 - 6*(-1/2)^n - 6| = | -6*(-1/2)^n | = 6|(-1/2)^n|Since |(-1/2)^n| = (1/2)^n, because the absolute value of (-1/2)^n is just (1/2)^n.So, the inequality becomes:6*(1/2)^n < 1/170  Divide both sides by 6:  (1/2)^n < 1/(1020)Now, I need to solve for n in this inequality. Let's take natural logarithms on both sides:ln((1/2)^n) < ln(1/1020)  n*ln(1/2) < ln(1/1020)  Since ln(1/2) is negative, dividing both sides by it will reverse the inequality:n > ln(1/1020)/ln(1/2)Compute ln(1/1020) = -ln(1020) ‚âà -6.928  Compute ln(1/2) = -ln(2) ‚âà -0.6931So, n > (-6.928)/(-0.6931) ‚âà 9.997Since n must be an integer greater than approximately 9.997, the smallest integer n is 10.Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes with logs, it's easy to make a mistake.Compute ln(1020):  ln(1000) ‚âà 6.9078, ln(1020) ‚âà 6.928 (as above).  ln(2) ‚âà 0.6931.So, ln(1/1020) = -6.928  ln(1/2) = -0.6931So, n > (-6.928)/(-0.6931) ‚âà 9.997, which is approximately 10.But let me check n=10 and n=9 to make sure.Compute (1/2)^10 = 1/1024 ‚âà 0.0009766  6*(1/2)^10 ‚âà 6/1024 ‚âà 0.005859  Which is less than 1/170 ‚âà 0.005882Wait, 1/170 is approximately 0.005882, and 6*(1/2)^10 ‚âà 0.005859, which is indeed less than 0.005882.But let's check n=9:(1/2)^9 = 1/512 ‚âà 0.001953125  6*(1/2)^9 ‚âà 6/512 ‚âà 0.01171875  Which is greater than 0.005882.Therefore, n=10 is the smallest integer where the inequality holds.So, the answer should be D: 10.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Simplify: ((sqrt[3]{7})^6).","answer":"To simplify ((sqrt[3]{7})^6), I recognize that the cube root of 7 can be expressed as 7 raised to the power of (frac{1}{3}).Next, I apply the exponent of 6 to this expression, which involves multiplying the exponents: (frac{1}{3} times 6 = 2).Therefore, ((sqrt[3]{7})^6) simplifies to (7^2), which equals 49."},{"question":"The town of Milburg has some grown-ups and 2987 children.

Additionally, if it is given that g(1) = g(-1) and g(2x) = 4g(x), find all possible values of g(0).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find all possible values of ( g(0) ) given the function ( g(x) ) satisfies the equation ( g(x + y) = g(x)g(y) ) for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ). Additionally, it's given that ( g(1) = g(-1) ) and ( g(2x) = 4g(x) ). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that functional equations often have standard approaches. The equation ( g(x + y) = g(x)g(y) ) is a well-known type of functional equation. I think it's called an exponential functional equation because exponential functions satisfy this property. So, maybe ( g(x) ) is an exponential function? But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.Let me start by plugging in specific values to see what I can find out. A common strategy is to set ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ) because that often simplifies things. So, let me set ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ):( g(0 + 0) = g(0)g(0) )Which simplifies to:( g(0) = [g(0)]^2 )Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:( [g(0)]^2 - g(0) = 0 )Factoring out ( g(0) ):( g(0)(g(0) - 1) = 0 )So, this gives me two possible solutions for ( g(0) ): either ( g(0) = 0 ) or ( g(0) = 1 ). Okay, so ( g(0) ) can be either 0 or 1. But I need to check which of these are consistent with the other given conditions.Next, let's look at the condition ( g(1) = g(-1) ). I wonder how this affects ( g(0) ). Maybe I can relate ( g(1) ) and ( g(-1) ) through the functional equation.Let me set ( x = 1 ) and ( y = -1 ) in the original equation:( g(1 + (-1)) = g(1)g(-1) )Simplifying the left side:( g(0) = g(1)g(-1) )But we know from the given condition that ( g(1) = g(-1) ), so let's denote ( g(1) = g(-1) = k ) for some constant ( k ). Then, the equation becomes:( g(0) = k cdot k = k^2 )So, ( g(0) = k^2 ). But earlier, we found that ( g(0) ) can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, ( k^2 ) must be either 0 or 1. So, ( k ) can be 0, 1, or -1. But wait, ( k = g(1) ), which is a real number. So, ( k ) can be 0, 1, or -1.But let's hold onto that thought for a moment and look at the third condition: ( g(2x) = 4g(x) ). This seems to relate the value of the function at ( 2x ) to its value at ( x ). Maybe I can use this to find more information about ( g(0) ).Let me set ( x = 0 ) in this condition:( g(2 cdot 0) = 4g(0) )Simplifying:( g(0) = 4g(0) )Hmm, that's interesting. Let me subtract ( g(0) ) from both sides:( g(0) - g(0) = 4g(0) - g(0) )Which simplifies to:( 0 = 3g(0) )So, ( 3g(0) = 0 ), which implies that ( g(0) = 0 ).Wait a second, earlier I had two possibilities for ( g(0) ): 0 or 1. But this condition forces ( g(0) ) to be 0. So, does that mean ( g(0) = 0 ) is the only possible value?But let me double-check because sometimes when you have multiple conditions, you have to make sure they don't conflict. So, if ( g(0) = 0 ), let's see what happens to the other conditions.First, from ( g(0) = k^2 ), if ( g(0) = 0 ), then ( k^2 = 0 ), so ( k = 0 ). That means ( g(1) = g(-1) = 0 ).Now, let's see if this is consistent with the functional equation ( g(x + y) = g(x)g(y) ). If ( g(1) = 0 ), then for any ( x ), ( g(x + 1) = g(x)g(1) = g(x) cdot 0 = 0 ). So, ( g(x + 1) = 0 ) for all ( x ). Similarly, ( g(x - 1) = 0 ) for all ( x ).But wait, if ( g(x + 1) = 0 ) for all ( x ), then ( g ) is identically zero for all real numbers. Because, for any real number ( x ), you can write it as ( (x - 1) + 1 ), so ( g(x) = g((x - 1) + 1) = g(x - 1)g(1) = 0 cdot 0 = 0 ). So, ( g(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ).But let's check if this satisfies all the given conditions:1. ( g(x + y) = 0 = 0 cdot 0 = g(x)g(y) ). So, that's satisfied.2. ( g(1) = 0 = g(-1) ). That's satisfied.3. ( g(2x) = 0 = 4 cdot 0 = 4g(x) ). That's also satisfied.So, the zero function is a solution, and in this case, ( g(0) = 0 ).But earlier, I thought ( g(0) ) could also be 1. Let me see if that's possible. Suppose ( g(0) = 1 ). Then, from ( g(0) = k^2 ), we have ( 1 = k^2 ), so ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -1 ). So, ( g(1) = g(-1) = 1 ) or ( g(1) = g(-1) = -1 ).Let me explore both possibilities.First, suppose ( g(1) = 1 ). Then, let's see what ( g(2x) = 4g(x) ) implies. Let me set ( x = 1 ):( g(2 cdot 1) = 4g(1) )So, ( g(2) = 4 cdot 1 = 4 ).But from the functional equation, ( g(2) = g(1 + 1) = g(1)g(1) = 1 cdot 1 = 1 ). Wait, that's a contradiction because ( g(2) ) should be 4 according to the third condition, but from the functional equation, it's 1. So, that's a problem.Similarly, if ( g(1) = -1 ), then let's see:( g(2) = g(1 + 1) = g(1)g(1) = (-1)(-1) = 1 ).But from the third condition, ( g(2) = 4g(1) = 4(-1) = -4 ). So, again, ( g(2) ) would have to be both 1 and -4, which is impossible.Therefore, if ( g(0) = 1 ), we run into contradictions with the third condition ( g(2x) = 4g(x) ). So, ( g(0) = 1 ) is not possible.Therefore, the only possible value for ( g(0) ) is 0.Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.1. From ( g(x + y) = g(x)g(y) ), setting ( x = y = 0 ) gives ( g(0) = [g(0)]^2 ), so ( g(0) = 0 ) or ( g(0) = 1 ).2. From ( g(1) = g(-1) ), we have ( g(0) = [g(1)]^2 ), so ( g(0) ) must be a square of some real number, which is consistent with it being 0 or 1.3. From ( g(2x) = 4g(x) ), setting ( x = 0 ) gives ( g(0) = 4g(0) ), which simplifies to ( g(0) = 0 ). So, this condition overrides the possibility of ( g(0) = 1 ).4. Checking if ( g(0) = 0 ) leads to the function being identically zero, which satisfies all the given conditions.5. Trying ( g(0) = 1 ) leads to contradictions with the third condition, so it's not possible.Therefore, the only possible value for ( g(0) ) is 0.I think that's thorough enough. I considered both possibilities for ( g(0) ), checked them against all the given conditions, and found that only ( g(0) = 0 ) works without leading to contradictions."},{"question":"A folded rectangle. Two opposite vertices of a rectangle with sides ( x ) and ( y ) are brought together. Find the length of the crease.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about folding a rectangle. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a rectangle with sides of length x and y. I need to bring two opposite vertices together, which means folding the rectangle so that, say, the bottom-left corner meets the top-right corner. When I do that, there will be a crease formed. The question is asking for the length of that crease.Hmm, okay. So, let me think about how folding works. When you fold a rectangle so that two opposite corners meet, the crease will be along the line that's equidistant from both corners. That line should be the perpendicular bisector of the diagonal connecting those two corners. So, the crease is essentially the perpendicular bisector of the diagonal of the rectangle.Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. If I have a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other. So, if I fold the rectangle along the perpendicular bisector of one diagonal, it should make the two opposite corners meet. That makes sense.So, the first step is to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal length d is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Got that.Now, the crease is the perpendicular bisector of this diagonal. So, I need to find the length of this perpendicular bisector within the rectangle. Hmm, how do I approach this?Maybe I can model the rectangle on a coordinate system to make it easier. Let's place the rectangle with its corners at (0,0), (x,0), (x,y), and (0,y). The diagonal connecting (0,0) and (x,y) has a midpoint at (x/2, y/2). The crease should pass through this midpoint and be perpendicular to the diagonal.The slope of the diagonal is (y - 0)/(x - 0) = y/x. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector (the crease) is -x/y.So, the equation of the crease line is y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2). Simplifying that, it becomes y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2), which simplifies further to y/2 = (-x^2)/(2y). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Let me try again. The general equation of a line with slope m passing through a point (h,k) is y - k = m(x - h). So, the crease has a slope of -x/y and passes through (x/2, y/2). Therefore, the equation is y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2). Simplifying, y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2). So, y/2 = (-x^2)/(2y). Hmm, that still leads to y/2 = -x^2/(2y), which implies y^2 = -x^2, which is impossible because squares are positive.Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the slope. Let me double-check. The slope of the diagonal is y/x, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector should be -x/y. That seems correct. Maybe the issue is in the equation setup.Alternatively, perhaps I should find the points where the crease intersects the sides of the rectangle. Since the crease is the perpendicular bisector, it should intersect two sides of the rectangle. Let me figure out where those intersection points are.Let me denote the crease as line PQ, intersecting the rectangle at points P and Q. Since the crease is the perpendicular bisector, it should intersect the rectangle at two points, and the segment PQ will be the crease whose length we need to find.To find the coordinates of P and Q, I can find where the crease line intersects the sides of the rectangle. The rectangle has sides at x=0, x=x, y=0, and y=y. The crease line has the equation y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2). Let me rewrite that equation:y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2)=> y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2)=> y/2 = (-x^2)/(2y)=> Multiply both sides by 2y:y^2 = -x^2Wait, that's the same result as before, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I need a different approach.Perhaps instead of trying to find the equation of the crease, I can use geometric properties or similar triangles. Let me think about the triangles formed when folding the rectangle.When I fold the rectangle so that corner A meets corner C, the crease PQ will form two congruent triangles on either side of the crease. Specifically, triangle APQ and triangle CPQ will be congruent. Since A and C are being brought together, the crease PQ must be equidistant from both A and C.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of reflection. When folding, point A is reflected over the crease PQ to coincide with point C. Therefore, PQ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment AC.Given that AC is the diagonal of the rectangle, its midpoint is at (x/2, y/2), and the crease PQ is the perpendicular bisector, which we already determined has a slope of -x/y.Perhaps instead of trying to find where PQ intersects the sides, I can find the distance from the midpoint to the sides and use that to find the length of PQ.Wait, another thought: the length of the crease PQ can be found using the formula for the length of a line segment in a rectangle, given its slope and the rectangle's dimensions.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, but I'm not sure if that applies here.Wait, perhaps using coordinate geometry is the way to go, but I need to set it up correctly. Let me try again.Let me denote the rectangle with vertices at A(0,0), B(x,0), C(x,y), and D(0,y). The diagonal AC has endpoints at (0,0) and (x,y). The midpoint of AC is at (x/2, y/2). The crease PQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, so it passes through (x/2, y/2) and has a slope of -x/y.So, the equation of PQ is:y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2)Simplifying:y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2)Multiply both sides by 2y to eliminate denominators:2y(y - y/2) = -x(x/2)Simplify left side:2y*(y/2) = y^2Right side:- x^2 / 2So, y^2 = -x^2 / 2Wait, that can't be right because y^2 and x^2 are positive, and this equation suggests y^2 is negative, which is impossible. I must be making a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, perhaps I should not have substituted the midpoint into the equation that way. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the general equation of the crease PQ.Since PQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, it has slope -x/y and passes through (x/2, y/2). So, the equation is:(y - y/2) = (-x/y)(x - x/2)But when I plug in x = x/2 and y = y/2, it should satisfy the equation, which it does. However, when I try to find where this line intersects the sides of the rectangle, I end up with an impossible equation. Maybe I need to find the intersection points differently.Let me consider the crease PQ intersecting the top side y = y and the bottom side y = 0, or maybe the left side x = 0 and the right side x = x. Let me see.First, let's find where PQ intersects the top side y = y.Substitute y = y into the equation:(y - y/2) = (-x/y)(x - x/2)=> y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2)=> Multiply both sides by y:y^2 / 2 = -x^2 / 2=> y^2 = -x^2Again, impossible. So, PQ does not intersect the top side y = y. Maybe it intersects the left and right sides?Let's try x = 0:Substitute x = 0 into the equation:(y - y/2) = (-x/y)(0 - x/2)=> y/2 = (-x/y)(-x/2)=> y/2 = (x^2)/(2y)=> Multiply both sides by 2y:y^2 = x^2=> y = x or y = -xBut since y and x are positive lengths, y = x. So, if y = x, then the rectangle is a square, and the crease would be along the other diagonal, which makes sense because in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.But in our case, the rectangle is not necessarily a square, so y ‚â† x. Therefore, the crease PQ does not intersect the left side x = 0 unless y = x.Similarly, let's try x = x:Substitute x = x into the equation:(y - y/2) = (-x/y)(x - x/2)=> y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2)=> Multiply both sides by y:y^2 / 2 = -x^2 / 2=> y^2 = -x^2Again, impossible. So, PQ does not intersect the right side x = x either.Hmm, that's confusing. If PQ doesn't intersect the top, bottom, left, or right sides, where does it intersect? Maybe it intersects the top and bottom sides, but at some point between x=0 and x=x.Wait, perhaps I need to solve for x and y where the crease intersects the sides. Let me set y = 0 and see where it intersects the bottom side.Substitute y = 0 into the equation:(0 - y/2) = (-x/y)(x - x/2)=> -y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2)=> Multiply both sides by y:- y^2 / 2 = -x^2 / 2=> y^2 = x^2=> y = xAgain, same result. So, unless y = x, the crease doesn't intersect the bottom side either. This suggests that my approach might be flawed.Maybe I need to consider that the crease PQ intersects two adjacent sides of the rectangle, not opposite sides. Let me think about that.If I fold the rectangle so that corner A(0,0) meets corner C(x,y), the crease PQ will lie inside the rectangle and intersect two adjacent sides. Let's say it intersects side AB at point P and side AD at point Q. Or maybe it intersects side AB and side BC? I need to figure out which sides it intersects.Alternatively, perhaps it intersects side AB and side CD? Wait, no, because those are opposite sides.Wait, maybe it's better to use vector geometry or coordinate geometry to find the intersection points.Let me parametrize the crease PQ. Since it has a slope of -x/y and passes through (x/2, y/2), its parametric equations can be written as:x = x/2 + ty = y/2 - (x/y) * tWhere t is a parameter.Now, I need to find the values of t where this line intersects the sides of the rectangle.The rectangle has sides at x=0, x=x, y=0, and y=y.So, let's find t when x=0:0 = x/2 + t => t = -x/2Substitute t = -x/2 into y:y = y/2 - (x/y)*(-x/2) = y/2 + (x^2)/(2y)Similarly, find t when x=x:x = x/2 + t => t = x/2Substitute t = x/2 into y:y = y/2 - (x/y)*(x/2) = y/2 - (x^2)/(2y)Now, check if these y-values are within the rectangle's bounds (0 ‚â§ y ‚â§ y).For t = -x/2:y = y/2 + (x^2)/(2y) = (y^2 + x^2)/(2y)Since x and y are positive, this y-value is greater than y/2. Is it less than or equal to y?(y^2 + x^2)/(2y) ‚â§ y ?Multiply both sides by 2y:y^2 + x^2 ‚â§ 2y^2=> x^2 ‚â§ y^2=> x ‚â§ yBut in the problem statement, it's not specified whether x ‚â• y or y ‚â• x. Wait, in the initial problem, it just says a rectangle with sides x and y. So, maybe I need to assume x ‚â• y or y ‚â• x?Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says \\"Two opposite vertices of a rectangle with sides x and y are brought together.\\" It doesn't specify which sides are longer. So, perhaps I need to consider both cases.But for now, let's assume x ‚â• y. Then, x^2 ‚â• y^2, so (y^2 + x^2)/(2y) ‚â• (y^2 + y^2)/(2y) = (2y^2)/(2y) = y. So, y = (y^2 + x^2)/(2y) ‚â• y, which implies y ‚â• y, so equality holds only when x = y.But since x ‚â• y, and x ‚â† y (unless it's a square), this y-value is greater than y, which is outside the rectangle. Therefore, the intersection at x=0 is outside the rectangle.Similarly, for t = x/2:y = y/2 - (x^2)/(2y)Is this y-value within 0 ‚â§ y ‚â§ y?y/2 - (x^2)/(2y) ‚â• 0 ?Multiply both sides by 2y:y^2 - x^2 ‚â• 0=> y^2 ‚â• x^2=> y ‚â• xBut we assumed x ‚â• y, so y^2 - x^2 ‚â§ 0, meaning y ‚â§ 0, which is not possible since y is a positive length. Therefore, this intersection is also outside the rectangle.Hmm, this suggests that the crease PQ does not intersect the left or right sides of the rectangle when x ‚â• y. So, where does it intersect?Maybe it intersects the top and bottom sides. Let's check.Set y = y:y = y/2 - (x/y)*t=> y - y/2 = - (x/y)*t=> y/2 = - (x/y)*t=> t = - (y^2)/(2x)Substitute t into x:x = x/2 + t = x/2 - (y^2)/(2x) = (x^2 - y^2)/(2x)Similarly, set y = 0:0 = y/2 - (x/y)*t=> y/2 = (x/y)*t=> t = (y^2)/(2x)Substitute t into x:x = x/2 + t = x/2 + (y^2)/(2x) = (x^2 + y^2)/(2x)So, the crease PQ intersects the top side y = y at point ((x^2 - y^2)/(2x), y) and the bottom side y = 0 at point ((x^2 + y^2)/(2x), 0).Now, we need to ensure that these x-values are within the rectangle's bounds, i.e., between 0 and x.For the top intersection:(x^2 - y^2)/(2x) must be between 0 and x.Since x ‚â• y, x^2 - y^2 ‚â• 0, so (x^2 - y^2)/(2x) ‚â• 0.Also, (x^2 - y^2)/(2x) ‚â§ x ?Multiply both sides by 2x:x^2 - y^2 ‚â§ 2x^2=> -y^2 ‚â§ x^2Which is always true since y^2 is positive.Similarly, for the bottom intersection:(x^2 + y^2)/(2x) must be between 0 and x.(x^2 + y^2)/(2x) ‚â• 0, which is true.And (x^2 + y^2)/(2x) ‚â§ x ?Multiply both sides by 2x:x^2 + y^2 ‚â§ 2x^2=> y^2 ‚â§ x^2Which is true since x ‚â• y.Therefore, the crease PQ intersects the top side at ((x^2 - y^2)/(2x), y) and the bottom side at ((x^2 + y^2)/(2x), 0).Now, to find the length of PQ, we can calculate the distance between these two points.Let me denote the top intersection point as P and the bottom intersection point as Q.So, P = ((x^2 - y^2)/(2x), y)Q = ((x^2 + y^2)/(2x), 0)The distance PQ is sqrt[(x_Q - x_P)^2 + (y_Q - y_P)^2]Calculate x_Q - x_P:(x^2 + y^2)/(2x) - (x^2 - y^2)/(2x) = [x^2 + y^2 - x^2 + y^2]/(2x) = (2y^2)/(2x) = y^2/xCalculate y_Q - y_P:0 - y = -ySo, distance PQ = sqrt[(y^2/x)^2 + (-y)^2] = sqrt[(y^4)/(x^2) + y^2] = sqrt[(y^4 + x^2 y^2)/x^2] = sqrt[y^2(y^2 + x^2)/x^2] = (y/x) sqrt(x^2 + y^2)Therefore, the length of the crease PQ is (y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x.Wait, let me double-check that calculation.Distance PQ:x difference: y^2/xy difference: -ySo, distance squared: (y^2/x)^2 + y^2 = y^4/x^2 + y^2 = (y^4 + x^2 y^2)/x^2 = y^2(y^2 + x^2)/x^2Square root of that: y sqrt(y^2 + x^2)/xYes, that seems correct.So, the length of the crease is (y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x.Alternatively, this can be written as (y/x) sqrt(x^2 + y^2).I think that's the answer. Let me see if it makes sense dimensionally and in special cases.If x = y, then the rectangle is a square, and the crease should be the other diagonal, which has length sqrt(x^2 + x^2) = x sqrt(2). Plugging x = y into our formula:(y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x = (x sqrt(2x^2))/x = (x * x sqrt(2))/x = x sqrt(2), which matches. Good.If y approaches 0, the rectangle becomes very thin. The crease should approach the length of the side x, because folding a very thin rectangle would just bring the two ends together along the length. Let's see:(y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x ‚âà (0 * x)/x = 0, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.Wait, if y approaches 0, the rectangle becomes a line segment of length x. Folding it so that the two ends meet would create a crease at the midpoint, which has length 0? That doesn't seem right.Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect in this limit. Let me think again.When y approaches 0, the rectangle is almost a line segment. Bringing two opposite corners together would mean folding along the perpendicular bisector, which in this case would be a line perpendicular to the segment at its midpoint. But since the segment has no height, the crease would have zero length? Or maybe it's undefined.Hmm, perhaps the formula still holds because as y approaches 0, (y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x approaches 0, which might make sense if we consider the crease becoming negligible.Alternatively, maybe my intuition is wrong because in reality, when y approaches 0, the crease would still have some length, but perhaps my coordinate system is not capturing it correctly.Wait, no, in the limit as y approaches 0, the crease PQ would indeed become very small because the fold is almost along the length of the rectangle, and the crease is the perpendicular bisector, which would be very short.Alternatively, if x approaches y, we get the square case, which works. If x is much larger than y, the crease length would be approximately (y sqrt(x^2))/x = y x /x = y, which makes sense because the crease would be roughly along the width y.Wait, let me check that. If x is much larger than y, then sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ‚âà x, so the crease length is approximately (y x)/x = y. That seems reasonable because the crease would be close to the width of the rectangle.So, overall, the formula seems to behave correctly in the limits.Therefore, I think the length of the crease is (y sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/x."},{"question":"What is the largest number of integers that can be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two chosen integers is not divisible by a given integer?","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this problem where I need to choose the largest number of integers from the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two chosen integers isn't divisible by a given integer. Hmm, okay, the problem mentions a given integer, but it doesn't specify which one. Maybe it's a typo or something missing. Wait, in the initial problem statement, it just says \\"a given integer,\\" but doesn't specify which one. That's a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume a specific integer? Or perhaps it's referring to a general case?Wait, looking back, the user wrote \\"What is the largest number of integers that can be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two chosen integers is not divisible by a given integer?\\" So it's a general question, but in the assistant's response, it assumed n=26. Maybe that's a standard problem where n=26? I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with n=26 as well, since that seems to be the context.Alright, so if n=26, then the problem becomes: choose the largest subset from {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two numbers isn't divisible by 26. Got it.First, I need to understand what it means for the sum of two numbers not to be divisible by 26. That means, for any two numbers x and y in my chosen subset, x + y should not be congruent to 0 modulo 26. In other words, x ‚â° -y mod 26. So, if I pick a number x, I shouldn't pick any number y such that y ‚â° -x mod 26.So, to avoid having any pair of numbers that add up to a multiple of 26, I need to ensure that for each residue class modulo 26, I don't pick both a number and its \\"complement\\" that would sum to 26. For example, if I pick a number that's 1 mod 26, I shouldn't pick any number that's 25 mod 26, because 1 + 25 = 26, which is 0 mod 26.Therefore, I can think of the residues modulo 26 as pairs that add up to 26: (1,25), (2,24), (3,23), ..., (12,14), and then 13 is alone because 13 + 13 = 26, which is 0 mod 26. So, for each of these pairs, I can only choose numbers from one residue class in each pair. For the 13 residue, since it pairs with itself, I can only choose at most one number from that residue class.Now, how many such pairs are there? From 1 to 25, excluding 13, there are 12 pairs, each adding up to 26. Plus the residue 13, which is alone. So, in total, there are 13 residue classes that are either in pairs or alone.To maximize the number of integers I can choose, I need to choose the larger group from each pair. For example, if one residue has more numbers in the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} than its complement, I should choose that residue. Similarly, for the residue 13, since it can only contribute one number, I have to be careful.So, first, I need to figure out how many numbers in {1, 2, ..., 1963} fall into each residue class modulo 26. Let's calculate that.The total number of integers is 1963. Divided by 26, that's 1963 / 26. Let me compute that: 26 * 75 = 1950, and 1963 - 1950 = 13. So, there are 75 full groups of 26, and then 13 extra numbers.Therefore, for residues 1 to 13, each residue will have 75 + 1 = 76 numbers, and for residues 14 to 26, each residue will have 75 numbers. Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Actually, when you divide 1963 by 26, you get 75 with a remainder of 13. So, the first 13 residues (1 to 13) will have one extra number each, making them 76 numbers each, and the remaining residues (14 to 26) will have 75 numbers each.So, residues 1 to 13: 76 numbers each.Residues 14 to 26: 75 numbers each.Okay, so now, for each pair (1,25), (2,24), ..., (12,14), I need to choose the residue with more numbers. Since residues 1 to 13 have 76 numbers, and residues 14 to 26 have 75 numbers, I should choose residues 1 to 13 for each pair.For example, for the pair (1,25), since residue 1 has 76 numbers and residue 25 has 75 numbers, I choose residue 1.Similarly, for (2,24), choose residue 2, and so on up to (12,14), choosing residue 12.Then, for residue 13, since it can only contribute one number (because 13 + 13 = 26 ‚â° 0 mod 26), I can include at most one number from residue 13.So, how many numbers is that? For each of the 12 pairs, I choose the residue with 76 numbers, so that's 12 * 76. Plus one number from residue 13.So, total numbers = 12 * 76 + 1.Let me compute that: 12 * 76 = 912, plus 1 is 913.Wait, but hold on. The total number of numbers in the set is 1963, and if I choose 913 numbers, that seems plausible. But let me double-check.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each pair of residues that add up to 26, we can choose all numbers from one residue, and none from the other. Since residues 1 to 13 have more numbers, we choose those.So, for each pair, we choose the larger residue, which gives us 76 numbers per residue for residues 1 to 12, and for residue 13, we can only choose one number.Wait, but actually, residue 13 is alone, so we can choose at most one number from it. So, total numbers would be 12 * 76 + 1 = 913.But wait, let's see: 12 residues with 76 numbers each is 912, plus 1 from residue 13 is 913. That seems correct.But hold on, the total number of numbers in the set is 1963, and 913 is roughly half of that, which makes sense because we're avoiding pairs that sum to 26.But let me think again: when we choose residues 1 to 13, each has 76 numbers, but residue 13 can only contribute one number because choosing more than one would result in their sum being 26, which is divisible by 26. So, actually, for residue 13, we can only choose one number.Therefore, the total number is 12 * 76 + 1 = 913.But wait, let me verify this with another approach.Another way is to consider that in order to avoid any two numbers summing to a multiple of 26, we can model this as a graph where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers whose sum is divisible by 26. Then, the problem reduces to finding the largest independent set in this graph.However, this graph is actually a collection of disjoint edges (for pairs that sum to 26) and a single node (for residue 13). Therefore, the largest independent set would be selecting one node from each edge and the single node. Since there are 1963 nodes, and each edge connects two nodes, the number of edges is 1963 / 2, but since 1963 is odd, it's 981 edges and one single node.Wait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm.Wait, no, actually, the number of edges would be based on the number of pairs that sum to 26. Since residues 1 to 12 pair with 25 to 14 respectively, and residue 13 is alone.So, for each of the 12 pairs, the number of such pairs is equal to the minimum of the counts in each residue. Since residue 1 has 76 numbers and residue 25 has 75 numbers, the number of pairs is 75. Similarly, for each pair (k, 26 - k), the number of pairs is 75, because residue k has 76 numbers and residue 26 - k has 75 numbers.Therefore, for each of the 12 pairs, there are 75 pairs that sum to 26. Plus, for residue 13, since there are 76 numbers, each pair within residue 13 sums to 26, so the number of such pairs is C(76, 2).But in terms of the independent set, to avoid any edges, we can choose all numbers from one side of each pair. So, for each pair (k, 26 - k), we choose all numbers from residue k, which has 76 numbers, and none from residue 26 - k, which has 75 numbers.Therefore, for each of the 12 pairs, we choose 76 numbers, and for residue 13, we can choose at most one number to avoid any pair summing to 26.So, total numbers chosen: 12 * 76 + 1 = 913.But wait, 12 * 76 is 912, plus 1 is 913. But 12 * 76 is 912, which is less than 1963. So, that seems correct.But earlier, I thought about the graph having 981 edges and one single node, but that might not be the right way to model it because the edges are not just between pairs of residues but within residues as well.Wait, actually, for residue 13, since all numbers are congruent to 13 mod 26, any two numbers from residue 13 will sum to 26, which is 0 mod 26. Therefore, we can choose at most one number from residue 13.Similarly, for each pair (k, 26 - k), we can choose all numbers from one residue and none from the other.Therefore, the maximum size of the subset is the sum over each pair of the maximum size of the two residues, plus at most one from residue 13.Since for each pair (k, 26 - k), residue k has 76 numbers and residue 26 - k has 75 numbers, we choose residue k, giving us 76 numbers per pair.There are 12 such pairs, so 12 * 76 = 912.Plus, from residue 13, we can choose at most one number, giving a total of 913.Therefore, the largest number of integers we can choose is 913.But wait, let me check if this is correct.Total numbers in the set: 1963.Numbers chosen: 913.Numbers not chosen: 1963 - 913 = 1050.But 1050 is roughly the sum of the smaller residues: 12 * 75 = 900, plus 76 (from residue 13), totaling 976. Wait, that doesn't add up.Wait, no, actually, the numbers not chosen would be the smaller residues: for each pair, we choose the larger residue (76 numbers) and leave the smaller residue (75 numbers). So, for 12 pairs, we leave 12 * 75 = 900 numbers. Plus, from residue 13, we leave 76 - 1 = 75 numbers.So, total numbers not chosen: 900 + 75 = 975.But 913 + 975 = 1888, which is less than 1963. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, no, actually, the total numbers in the set are 1963, which is 26 * 75 + 13. So, residues 1 to 13 have 76 numbers each, and residues 14 to 26 have 75 numbers each.So, total numbers in residues 1 to 13: 13 * 76 = 988.Total numbers in residues 14 to 26: 13 * 75 = 975.So, total numbers: 988 + 975 = 1963. That checks out.Now, when choosing our subset, we choose residues 1 to 12 (each with 76 numbers) and one number from residue 13.So, total chosen: 12 * 76 + 1 = 912 + 1 = 913.Numbers not chosen: residues 14 to 26 (each with 75 numbers) and 75 numbers from residue 13.So, numbers not chosen: 13 * 75 + (76 - 1) = 975 + 75 = 1050.Wait, 913 + 1050 = 1963. Yes, that adds up.Therefore, the maximum number of integers we can choose is 913.But wait, in the assistant's initial response, it concluded with 76. That seems way too low. Did I make a mistake?Wait, no, 76 would be if we were choosing one residue class, but we're choosing multiple residue classes. So, 12 residue classes with 76 numbers each plus one number from residue 13 gives 913.But let me think again: is there a way to choose more numbers?Wait, if I choose all numbers from residue 1 to 13, that's 13 * 76 = 988 numbers. But then, within residue 13, any two numbers sum to 26, which is divisible by 26. So, we can't choose all 76 numbers from residue 13. We can only choose one number from residue 13.Therefore, the maximum is 12 * 76 + 1 = 913.Alternatively, if we choose residues 14 to 26, each has 75 numbers, and we can choose all of them, but then we have to avoid choosing any numbers from residues 1 to 12. But that would give us 13 * 75 = 975 numbers, which is less than 913. So, 913 is better.Therefore, 913 is the maximum.But wait, in the assistant's response, it concluded with 76. That seems incorrect. Maybe the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, but the assistant thought of a different modulus.Wait, the user initially wrote \\"What is the largest number of integers that can be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two chosen integers is not divisible by a given integer?\\" and then the assistant assumed n=26.But in the problem statement, the user didn't specify n=26. So, perhaps the assistant assumed n=26, but the user didn't specify. Maybe the user intended a different modulus.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of any integer, which doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the problem is to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of a specific integer, say, 26.But without knowing the specific integer, it's hard to answer. However, the assistant assumed n=26, so perhaps that's the intended modulus.In that case, the maximum number is 913.But wait, in the assistant's response, it concluded with 76, which is way too low. So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe the problem is to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, but the assistant thought of choosing numbers with residues 1 to 13, but only one number from residue 13, giving 13 numbers. But that would be 13, not 76.Wait, no, 13 residue classes, each with 76 numbers, but only choosing one number from residue 13. So, 12 * 76 + 1 = 913.Alternatively, if the problem was to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, and the modulus was 26, then the maximum size is indeed 913.But in the assistant's response, it concluded with 76, which seems incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, and the maximum size is 76. But that would be if we choose numbers from one residue class, but that's not the case.Wait, no, if we choose numbers from residue 1, which has 76 numbers, and none from residue 25, then we can have 76 numbers. Similarly, choosing from residue 2, 76 numbers, etc. But to maximize, we can choose multiple residue classes as long as they don't pair up to 26.So, choosing residues 1 to 12, each with 76 numbers, and one number from residue 13, giving 913.Therefore, the correct answer should be 913.But in the assistant's response, it concluded with 76, which is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the problem was to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, and the maximum size is 76. But that would be if we choose numbers from one residue class, but that's not the case.Wait, no, because choosing multiple residue classes that don't pair up to 26 would allow us to choose more numbers.Therefore, the correct answer is 913.But in the assistant's response, it concluded with 76, which is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to choose numbers such that no two sum to a multiple of 26, and the modulus was 26, but the assistant made a mistake in the calculation.In conclusion, the largest number of integers that can be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 1963} such that the sum of any two chosen integers is not divisible by 26 is 913."},{"question":"Owen spends 1.20 per litre on gasoline.

Reversing the digits gives the length of the perpendicular chord CD. The distance from their intersection point H to the center O is a positive rational number. Determine the length of AB.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where there's a circle with diameter AB, and the length of AB is a two-digit integer. When you reverse the digits, that gives the length of a perpendicular chord CD. The distance from their intersection point H to the center O is a positive rational number. I need to find the length of AB.Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, let's denote the length of AB as a two-digit number. Let's say AB is 10a + b, where a is the tens digit and b is the units digit. Then, reversing the digits gives us CD, which would be 10b + a.Since AB is the diameter, the radius of the circle is (10a + b)/2. The center of the circle, O, is the midpoint of AB. Now, CD is a chord perpendicular to AB, and they intersect at point H. So, H is the midpoint of CD as well because in a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.So, the length of CD is 10b + a, which means half of CD is (10b + a)/2. Similarly, half of AB is (10a + b)/2.Now, since AB and CD are perpendicular and intersect at H, we can form a right triangle with sides OH, CH, and CO. Here, CO is the radius, which is (10a + b)/2, CH is half of CD, which is (10b + a)/2, and OH is the distance from the center to the intersection point, which is given to be a positive rational number.Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle COH, we have:(CO)^2 = (CH)^2 + (OH)^2Plugging in the values we have:[(10a + b)/2]^2 = [(10b + a)/2]^2 + (OH)^2Let me simplify this equation. First, square both sides:[(10a + b)^2]/4 = [(10b + a)^2]/4 + (OH)^2Subtract [(10b + a)^2]/4 from both sides:[(10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2]/4 = (OH)^2Let me compute the numerator:(10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2Expanding both squares:(100a^2 + 20ab + b^2) - (100b^2 + 20ab + a^2)Simplify:100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 - 100b^2 - 20ab - a^2Combine like terms:(100a^2 - a^2) + (20ab - 20ab) + (b^2 - 100b^2)Which simplifies to:99a^2 - 99b^2Factor out 99:99(a^2 - b^2)So, the numerator is 99(a^2 - b^2). Therefore, the equation becomes:[99(a^2 - b^2)] / 4 = (OH)^2So, (OH)^2 = [99(a^2 - b^2)] / 4Since OH is a positive rational number, (OH)^2 must be a perfect square. Therefore, [99(a^2 - b^2)] / 4 must be a perfect square.Let me denote k = a^2 - b^2. So, [99k]/4 must be a perfect square.Since 99 is 9*11, which is 3^2*11, so [9*11*k]/4 must be a perfect square. Therefore, 11*k must be a perfect square because 9 is already a perfect square.So, 11*k must be a perfect square. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 11, say k = 11*m^2, where m is an integer.But k = a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So, (a - b)(a + b) must be equal to 11*m^2.Since a and b are digits (from 0 to 9), a + b can be at most 18, and a - b can be at most 9 (if a > b) or at least -9 (if b > a). But since we're dealing with lengths, a must be greater than b because AB is a two-digit number, so a can't be zero, and a > b to make AB > CD.So, a > b, so a - b is positive. Therefore, (a - b)(a + b) = 11*m^2.Now, since a and b are digits, a + b is between 1 and 18, and a - b is between 1 and 9.Given that 11 is a prime number, and (a - b)(a + b) must be a multiple of 11, either (a - b) or (a + b) must be a multiple of 11.But since a + b is at most 18, the only multiple of 11 possible is 11 itself. So, either a + b = 11 or a - b = 11. But a - b can't be 11 because a and b are single digits, so the maximum a - b can be is 9 (if a=9 and b=0). So, a + b must be 11.Therefore, a + b = 11.So, now we have:(a - b)(11) = 11*m^2Simplify:(a - b) = m^2So, a - b must be a perfect square.Given that a and b are digits, and a + b = 11, and a - b is a perfect square, let's find possible values of a and b.Possible perfect squares for a - b: 0, 1, 4, 9.But a > b, so a - b can't be 0. So, possible values are 1, 4, 9.Let's test each case:Case 1: a - b = 1Then, a + b = 11 and a - b = 1Adding both equations:2a = 12 => a = 6Then, b = 11 - a = 5So, a=6, b=5. Therefore, AB = 10a + b = 65, and CD = 10b + a = 56.Case 2: a - b = 4Then, a + b = 11 and a - b = 4Adding both equations:2a = 15 => a = 7.5But a must be an integer digit, so this case is invalid.Case 3: a - b = 9Then, a + b = 11 and a - b = 9Adding both equations:2a = 20 => a = 10But a must be a single digit, so this case is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is a=6 and b=5, so AB=65.Let me verify this:AB=65, so radius is 32.5CD=56, so half of CD is 28Using Pythagorean theorem:OH^2 = (32.5)^2 - (28)^2Calculate:32.5^2 = 1056.2528^2 = 784So, OH^2 = 1056.25 - 784 = 272.25Which is (16.5)^2, so OH=16.5, which is 33/2, a rational number. Perfect.So, the length of AB is 65."},{"question":"Define a 3 times 3 matrix mathbf{P} such that for a given 3 times 3 matrix mathbf{Q}, the product mathbf{P} mathbf{Q} results in swapping the second row and third row of mathbf{Q}, negating the first row of mathbf{Q}, and tripling the second row of the resultant matrix. Find mathbf{P}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find a 3x3 matrix P such that when I multiply it by another 3x3 matrix Q, it does a few specific things to Q. Specifically, it should swap the second and third rows of Q, negate the first row of Q, and then triple the second row of the resulting matrix. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that matrix multiplication can be used to perform row operations on another matrix. So, if I have matrix P multiplying matrix Q, the resulting matrix PQ will have rows that are combinations of the rows of Q based on the entries in P. That makes sense because each row of P acts as a linear combination of the columns of Q.Let me recall how matrix multiplication works. If I have a matrix P with rows p1, p2, p3 and a matrix Q with columns q1, q2, q3, then the product PQ will have entries where each row of P is multiplied by each column of Q. So, the first row of PQ is p1 multiplied by each column of Q, which gives the first row of PQ as a combination of the rows of Q weighted by p1.Given that, I need to figure out what each row of P should be to achieve the desired transformations on Q. Let's list out the transformations again:1. Swap the second and third rows of Q.2. Negate the first row of Q.3. Triple the second row of the resultant matrix.Wait, actually, the problem says that after swapping the second and third rows and negating the first row, we then triple the second row of the resultant matrix. So, the tripling happens after the swapping and negation. That means the order of operations is important here.Let me think about how to represent each of these operations as matrix multiplications.First, swapping the second and third rows of Q can be achieved by a permutation matrix. A permutation matrix for swapping rows 2 and 3 would have 1s on the diagonal except for the second and third rows, which would be swapped. So, the permutation matrix S would look like:S = [1 0 0     0 0 1     0 1 0]Then, negating the first row of Q can be achieved by scaling the first row by -1. This can be represented by a diagonal matrix N where the first diagonal entry is -1 and the others are 1. So, N would be:N = [-1 0 0      0 1 0      0 0 1]Next, tripling the second row of the resultant matrix. This is another scaling operation, but this time on the second row. So, the scaling matrix T would have a 3 on the second diagonal entry and 1s elsewhere:T = [1 0 0      0 3 0      0 0 1]Now, the problem is that these operations need to be combined into a single matrix P such that PQ gives the desired result. But since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the order in which we apply these operations matters.The problem specifies that first, we swap the second and third rows, then negate the first row, and finally triple the second row of the resultant matrix. So, the order of operations is: swap, negate, triple.But in terms of matrix multiplication, the operations are applied from right to left. That is, the rightmost matrix is applied first. So, if we want to first swap, then negate, then triple, the overall matrix P would be T * N * S, right?Wait, let me verify that. If I have PQ = T * N * S * Q, then S is applied first, then N, then T. So, yes, that would correspond to swapping first, then negating, then tripling.But let me double-check. If I have P = T * N * S, then PQ = T * N * S * Q. So, S * Q swaps the rows, then N * (S * Q) negates the first row, and finally T * (N * S * Q) triples the second row. That seems correct.But let me think about whether this is the correct approach. Alternatively, could I construct P directly by considering how each row of P should combine the rows of Q to achieve the desired result?Let me try that approach as well to see if I get the same result.So, let's denote P as:P = [p11 p12 p13     p21 p22 p23     p31 p32 p33]And Q as:Q = [q11 q12 q13     q21 q22 q23     q31 q32 q33]Then, the product PQ will be:PQ = [p11*q11 + p12*q21 + p13*q31, p11*q12 + p12*q22 + p13*q32, p11*q13 + p12*q23 + p13*q33      p21*q11 + p22*q21 + p23*q31, p21*q12 + p22*q22 + p23*q32, p21*q13 + p22*q23 + p23*q33      p31*q11 + p32*q21 + p33*q31, p31*q12 + p32*q22 + p33*q32, p31*q13 + p32*q23 + p33*q33]Now, according to the problem, the resulting matrix PQ should have:1. The first row of Q negated.2. The second and third rows of Q swapped.3. The second row of the resultant matrix (which is the third row of Q) tripled.Wait, actually, the problem says: \\"swapping the second row and third row of Q, negating the first row of Q, and tripling the second row of the resultant matrix.\\"So, let's parse this step by step.First, swap the second and third rows of Q. So, the new second row is the old third row, and the new third row is the old second row.Then, negate the first row of Q. So, the first row becomes -1 times the original first row.Then, triple the second row of the resultant matrix. So, after swapping and negating, the second row (which was originally the third row of Q) is then tripled.So, the final matrix PQ should have:- First row: -1 * original first row of Q.- Second row: 3 * original third row of Q.- Third row: original second row of Q.Wait, is that correct? Let me see.Original Q:Row 1: q1Row 2: q2Row 3: q3After swapping rows 2 and 3:Row 1: q1Row 2: q3Row 3: q2Then, negate the first row:Row 1: -q1Row 2: q3Row 3: q2Then, triple the second row:Row 1: -q1Row 2: 3*q3Row 3: q2So, yes, the final matrix PQ should have:Row 1: -q1Row 2: 3*q3Row 3: q2Therefore, in terms of the product PQ, each row of PQ is a combination of the rows of Q.So, let's write out what each row of P should be.Row 1 of PQ: -q1 = -1*q1 + 0*q2 + 0*q3. So, the first row of P should be [-1, 0, 0].Row 2 of PQ: 3*q3 = 0*q1 + 0*q2 + 3*q3. So, the second row of P should be [0, 0, 3].Wait, but hold on, in the product PQ, each row is a combination of the rows of Q. But actually, in matrix multiplication, each row of P is multiplied by the columns of Q, which are the original columns of Q, not the rows. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.Wait, no, actually, when you multiply P (rows) by Q (columns), each entry in PQ is the dot product of a row of P and a column of Q. But the rows of PQ are linear combinations of the rows of Q, weighted by the corresponding row of P.Wait, let me clarify. If I have P as a 3x3 matrix and Q as a 3x3 matrix, then PQ is also a 3x3 matrix where each row is a linear combination of the rows of Q, with the coefficients given by the corresponding row of P.So, if I want the first row of PQ to be -q1, then the first row of P must be [-1, 0, 0], because when I multiply this row by Q, I get -1*q1 + 0*q2 + 0*q3 = -q1.Similarly, for the second row of PQ to be 3*q3, the second row of P must be [0, 0, 3], because 0*q1 + 0*q2 + 3*q3 = 3*q3.And for the third row of PQ to be q2, the third row of P must be [0, 1, 0], because 0*q1 + 1*q2 + 0*q3 = q2.Wait, but hold on, that would make P:P = [-1 0 0      0 0 3      0 1 0]But let's verify if this works.Let me take a sample matrix Q and see what happens when I multiply P by Q.Let Q be:Q = [1 2 3      4 5 6      7 8 9]Then, PQ should be:First row: -1*1 + 0*4 + 0*7 = -1; similarly, -2, -3. So, first row: [-1, -2, -3].Second row: 0*1 + 0*4 + 3*7 = 21; similarly, 0*2 + 0*5 + 3*8 = 24; 0*3 + 0*6 + 3*9 = 27. So, second row: [21, 24, 27].Third row: 0*1 + 1*4 + 0*7 = 4; 0*2 + 1*5 + 0*8 = 5; 0*3 + 1*6 + 0*9 = 6. So, third row: [4, 5, 6].Now, let's see what the desired transformations would do to Q.Original Q:Row 1: [1, 2, 3]Row 2: [4, 5, 6]Row 3: [7, 8, 9]After swapping rows 2 and 3:Row 1: [1, 2, 3]Row 2: [7, 8, 9]Row 3: [4, 5, 6]Then, negate the first row:Row 1: [-1, -2, -3]Row 2: [7, 8, 9]Row 3: [4, 5, 6]Then, triple the second row:Row 1: [-1, -2, -3]Row 2: [21, 24, 27]Row 3: [4, 5, 6]Which matches exactly with the result of PQ as computed above. So, P = [-1 0 0; 0 0 3; 0 1 0] works.Wait, but in my initial approach, I thought of P as T * N * S, where S swaps rows 2 and 3, N negates the first row, and T triples the second row. Let's see what that would look like.First, S is:S = [1 0 0     0 0 1     0 1 0]N is:N = [-1 0 0      0 1 0      0 0 1]T is:T = [1 0 0      0 3 0      0 0 1]So, P = T * N * S.Let's compute T * N first.T * N:First row of T: [1 0 0] multiplied by N:1*(-1) + 0*0 + 0*0 = -11*0 + 0*1 + 0*0 = 01*0 + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0So, first row: [-1, 0, 0]Second row of T: [0 3 0] multiplied by N:0*(-1) + 3*0 + 0*0 = 00*0 + 3*1 + 0*0 = 30*0 + 3*0 + 0*1 = 0So, second row: [0, 3, 0]Third row of T: [0 0 1] multiplied by N:0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*0 = 00*0 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 00*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1So, third row: [0, 0, 1]Thus, T * N = [-1 0 0; 0 3 0; 0 0 1]Now, multiply this by S:(T * N) * S:First row: [-1 0 0] multiplied by S:-1*1 + 0*0 + 0*0 = -1-1*0 + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0-1*0 + 0*1 + 0*0 = 0So, first row: [-1, 0, 0]Second row: [0 3 0] multiplied by S:0*1 + 3*0 + 0*0 = 00*0 + 3*0 + 0*1 = 00*0 + 3*1 + 0*0 = 3So, second row: [0, 0, 3]Third row: [0 0 1] multiplied by S:0*1 + 0*0 + 1*0 = 00*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 10*0 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 0So, third row: [0, 1, 0]Thus, P = T * N * S = [-1 0 0; 0 0 3; 0 1 0], which matches the P we constructed earlier by directly considering the row operations.So, both approaches lead to the same matrix P. Therefore, the correct matrix P is:P = [-1 0 0      0 0 3      0 1 0]Let me just double-check with another example to be sure.Let Q be:Q = [a b c      d e f      g h i]Then, PQ should be:First row: -1*a + 0*d + 0*g = -a; similarly, -b, -c. So, first row: [-a, -b, -c].Second row: 0*a + 0*d + 3*g = 3g; similarly, 3h, 3i. So, second row: [3g, 3h, 3i].Third row: 0*a + 1*d + 0*g = d; similarly, e, f. So, third row: [d, e, f].Now, let's apply the transformations step by step to Q.Original Q:Row 1: [a, b, c]Row 2: [d, e, f]Row 3: [g, h, i]After swapping rows 2 and 3:Row 1: [a, b, c]Row 2: [g, h, i]Row 3: [d, e, f]Then, negate the first row:Row 1: [-a, -b, -c]Row 2: [g, h, i]Row 3: [d, e, f]Then, triple the second row:Row 1: [-a, -b, -c]Row 2: [3g, 3h, 3i]Row 3: [d, e, f]Which matches exactly with the result of PQ as computed above. So, P works correctly.Therefore, the matrix P is:P = [-1 0 0      0 0 3      0 1 0]I think that's the correct answer.

If one of its asymptotes is parallel to the line x - y + 3 = 0, find the eccentricity of the hyperbola.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola, and I need to find its eccentricity. Let me try to remember what I know about hyperbolas. The equation given is (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a > 0) and (b > 0). I know that for hyperbolas of this form, the transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the asymptotes are the lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches.The problem says that one of the asymptotes is parallel to the line (x - y + 3 = 0). Hmm, okay, so I need to find the slope of that line first because if two lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Let me rewrite the equation (x - y + 3 = 0) in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c) to find its slope.Starting with (x - y + 3 = 0), I can rearrange it as:[-y = -x - 3]Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:[y = x + 3]So the slope (m) of this line is 1. That means the asymptote of the hyperbola that's parallel to this line must also have a slope of 1.Now, recalling the standard form of the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the equations of its asymptotes are (y = pm frac{b}{a}x). Since one of these asymptotes has a slope of 1, that means either (frac{b}{a} = 1) or (-frac{b}{a} = 1). But since both (a) and (b) are positive, (frac{b}{a}) must be positive. So, (frac{b}{a} = 1), which implies that (b = a).Okay, so now I know that (b = a). Next, I need to find the eccentricity of the hyperbola. Eccentricity (e) is defined as (e = frac{c}{a}), where (c) is the distance from the center to each focus. For hyperbolas, (c) is related to (a) and (b) by the equation (c^2 = a^2 + b^2).Since (b = a), substituting into the equation gives:[c^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2]Taking the square root of both sides, we get:[c = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2}]Now, plugging this back into the formula for eccentricity:[e = frac{c}{a} = frac{asqrt{2}}{a} = sqrt{2}]So, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (sqrt{2}).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I found the slope of the given line correctly, which is 1. Then, I set the slope of the asymptote equal to 1, which led me to (b = a). Using the relationship (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), I substituted (b) with (a) and correctly simplified to find (c = asqrt{2}). Finally, dividing (c) by (a) gives me the eccentricity as (sqrt{2}). That seems right.I don't think I made any calculation errors. Maybe I can visualize the hyperbola to confirm. If (b = a), the asymptotes are at 45 degrees, which makes sense because the slope is 1. The foci are further out along the x-axis, and the eccentricity being greater than 1 also makes sense because eccentricity for hyperbolas is always greater than 1. So, yeah, I think I did this correctly.**Final Answer**The eccentricity of the hyperbola is (boxed{sqrt{2}})."},{"question":"Altitudes overline{AX} and overline{BY} of acute triangle ABC intersect at H. If angle BAC = 55^circ and angle ABC = 80^circ, then what is angle CHX?","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an acute triangle ABC. The problem says that the altitudes AX and BY intersect at H. I know that in a triangle, the point where all three altitudes intersect is called the orthocenter. So, H must be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The given angles are angle BAC, which is 55 degrees, and angle ABC, which is 80 degrees. I need to find angle CHX. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure where point X is located, but since AX is an altitude, X must be the foot of the altitude from A to BC. Similarly, Y is the foot of the altitude from B to AC. First, maybe I should sketch the triangle to visualize everything. Let me imagine triangle ABC with A at the top, B at the bottom left, and C at the bottom right. Since it's an acute triangle, all altitudes will lie inside the triangle. So, AX is perpendicular to BC, and BY is perpendicular to AC. Their intersection is H, the orthocenter.Now, I need to find angle CHX. Let me think about point X. Since AX is an altitude, X is on BC. So, CHX is the angle at point H between points C and X. I need to figure out the measure of this angle.I remember that in a triangle, the orthocenter has some interesting properties. Maybe I can use some angle relationships or properties of similar triangles here. Let me recall that the orthocenter, along with the vertices and the feet of the altitudes, forms several right angles because of the altitudes.Given that angle BAC is 55 degrees and angle ABC is 80 degrees, I can find angle ACB since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let me calculate that first.Angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees55 + 80 + angle ACB = 180135 + angle ACB = 180angle ACB = 180 - 135angle ACB = 45 degreesOkay, so angle ACB is 45 degrees. That might be useful later.Now, since AX and BY are altitudes intersecting at H, and we're dealing with angle CHX, maybe I can look at triangle CHX. Let me see what I know about this triangle.Point X is on BC, and H is the orthocenter. So, CH is another altitude from C to AB. Wait, no, CH isn't necessarily an altitude unless we draw it. But in this case, since H is the orthocenter, CH is indeed the third altitude from C to AB. So, CH is perpendicular to AB.Wait, but X is on BC, not on AB. So, CH is perpendicular to AB, but X is on BC. Hmm, so maybe I can relate these somehow.Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (b, 0), and point C at (c, d). But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric relationships.Alternatively, perhaps using cyclic quadrilaterals. I remember that in a triangle, the orthocenter creates several cyclic quadrilaterals because of the right angles. For example, points A, B, H, and the foot of the altitude from C form a cyclic quadrilateral.Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating things. Let me think about triangle CHX. Since H is the orthocenter, and X is the foot of the altitude from A, maybe I can find some right angles or similar triangles.Let me see. Since AX is perpendicular to BC, and CH is perpendicular to AB, maybe I can find some relationship between angles at H.Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle HXB. Since AX is an altitude, angle AXB is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle BYC is 90 degrees.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H creates several smaller triangles, each of which is similar to the original triangle or to each other.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the angles at H relate to the original angles of the triangle.Wait, let me think about the angles around H. Since H is the orthocenter, the angles at H are related to the original angles of the triangle. For example, angle BHC is equal to 180 degrees minus angle BAC. Let me verify that.In triangle ABC, angle BHC = 180 - angle BAC. So, angle BHC = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees. Hmm, that might be useful.But I'm supposed to find angle CHX. Let me see if I can express angle CHX in terms of other angles.Wait, point X is on BC, and H is the orthocenter. So, maybe triangle CHX is related to triangle CHB or something.Wait, let me think about triangle CHB. Since CH is perpendicular to AB, and H is the orthocenter, triangle CHB is a right triangle at H. So, angle CHB is 90 degrees.In triangle CHB, we have angle CHB = 90 degrees, angle HBC is equal to angle ABC, which is 80 degrees. Wait, no, angle HBC is not necessarily equal to angle ABC. Wait, angle HBC is part of angle ABC.Wait, let me clarify. In triangle ABC, angle ABC is 80 degrees. Point H is inside the triangle, so angle HBC is part of angle ABC. Similarly, angle ABH is another part.Wait, maybe I can find angle HBC. Since BY is an altitude, angle YBC is 90 degrees. Wait, no, BY is perpendicular to AC, so angle YBC is not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, no, BY is the altitude from B to AC, so it is perpendicular to AC. So, angle YBC is 90 degrees.Wait, no, BY is perpendicular to AC, so angle YBA is 90 degrees. Wait, I'm getting confused.Let me try a different approach. Maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle.Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (b, 0), and point C at (c, d). Then, I can find the coordinates of H by finding the intersection of the altitudes AX and BY.But this might take some time. Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.Wait, another idea: since we know all the angles of triangle ABC, maybe we can use the fact that the orthocenter creates certain angles.Wait, in triangle ABC, the angles are 55, 80, and 45 degrees. So, angle BAC = 55, angle ABC = 80, angle ACB = 45.Now, the orthocenter H has the property that the angles at H are equal to 180 degrees minus the angles of the triangle. So, angle BHC = 180 - angle BAC = 125 degrees, angle AHB = 180 - angle ACB = 135 degrees, and angle AHC = 180 - angle ABC = 100 degrees.Wait, but I'm supposed to find angle CHX. Let me think about point X. Since X is the foot of the altitude from A to BC, maybe I can relate angle CHX to these angles.Alternatively, maybe considering triangle CHX. Since CH is perpendicular to AB, and X is on BC, maybe I can find some relationship.Wait, let me think about triangle CHX. We need to find angle at H, which is angle CHX.Wait, perhaps using the fact that in triangle CHX, we can find some angles if we know other angles or sides.Alternatively, maybe considering the cyclic quadrilateral. Since AX is perpendicular to BC, and CH is perpendicular to AB, maybe quadrilateral HXBC is cyclic? Wait, not necessarily.Wait, another idea: since AX and CH are both altitudes, they intersect at H, so maybe triangle HXC is similar to some other triangle.Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for some properties or theorems related to orthocenters and angles.Wait, I remember that in a triangle, the orthocenter, the vertices, and the feet of the altitudes form several cyclic quadrilaterals. For example, points A, B, H, and the foot of the altitude from C form a cyclic quadrilateral because they all lie on a circle with diameter AH or something.Wait, maybe that's not directly helpful here. Let me think differently.Since we know all the angles of triangle ABC, maybe we can find some lengths or ratios using the sine law or cosine law.Wait, but without knowing any side lengths, it might be difficult. Maybe assigning some arbitrary lengths.Let me assume that AB is of length 1. Then, using the sine law, I can find the other sides.Wait, let's try that. Let me denote AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b.Using the sine law:a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin CGiven angle A = 55 degrees, angle B = 80 degrees, angle C = 45 degrees.Let me set AB = c = 1. Then,a / sin 55 = 1 / sin 45a = sin 55 / sin 45 ‚âà 0.8192 / 0.7071 ‚âà 1.158Similarly,b / sin 80 = 1 / sin 45b = sin 80 / sin 45 ‚âà 0.9848 / 0.7071 ‚âà 1.392So, sides are approximately AB = 1, BC ‚âà 1.158, AC ‚âà 1.392.Now, maybe I can find the coordinates of H.Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (1, 0). Then, point C is somewhere in the plane. Let me find its coordinates.Using the distances, AC ‚âà 1.392, BC ‚âà 1.158.So, coordinates of C satisfy:Distance from A: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ‚âà 1.392Distance from B: sqrt((x - 1)^2 + y^2) ‚âà 1.158Let me square both equations:x^2 + y^2 ‚âà (1.392)^2 ‚âà 1.938(x - 1)^2 + y^2 ‚âà (1.158)^2 ‚âà 1.341Subtracting the second equation from the first:x^2 + y^2 - [(x - 1)^2 + y^2] ‚âà 1.938 - 1.341x^2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) ‚âà 0.5972x - 1 ‚âà 0.5972x ‚âà 1.597x ‚âà 0.7985Then, plugging back into x^2 + y^2 ‚âà 1.938:(0.7985)^2 + y^2 ‚âà 1.9380.6376 + y^2 ‚âà 1.938y^2 ‚âà 1.3004y ‚âà 1.139So, coordinates of C are approximately (0.7985, 1.139).Now, I need to find the orthocenter H. To do this, I can find the equations of two altitudes and find their intersection.First, let's find the equation of altitude AX from A to BC.Point A is (0, 0). The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.First, find the slope of BC.Coordinates of B: (1, 0)Coordinates of C: (0.7985, 1.139)Slope of BC: (1.139 - 0) / (0.7985 - 1) = 1.139 / (-0.2015) ‚âà -5.65So, the slope of BC is approximately -5.65. Therefore, the slope of the altitude AX, which is perpendicular to BC, is the negative reciprocal: 1/5.65 ‚âà 0.1768.So, the equation of altitude AX is y = 0.1768x.Now, let's find the equation of altitude BY from B to AC.Point B is (1, 0). The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.First, find the slope of AC.Coordinates of A: (0, 0)Coordinates of C: (0.7985, 1.139)Slope of AC: (1.139 - 0) / (0.7985 - 0) ‚âà 1.139 / 0.7985 ‚âà 1.426So, the slope of AC is approximately 1.426. Therefore, the slope of the altitude BY, which is perpendicular to AC, is the negative reciprocal: -1/1.426 ‚âà -0.701.So, the equation of altitude BY is y - 0 = -0.701(x - 1), which simplifies to y = -0.701x + 0.701.Now, to find the orthocenter H, we need to solve the system of equations:y = 0.1768xy = -0.701x + 0.701Setting them equal:0.1768x = -0.701x + 0.7010.1768x + 0.701x = 0.7010.8778x = 0.701x ‚âà 0.701 / 0.8778 ‚âà 0.798Then, y ‚âà 0.1768 * 0.798 ‚âà 0.141So, the orthocenter H is approximately at (0.798, 0.141).Now, point X is the foot of the altitude from A to BC. We already have the equation of BC, which we found earlier. Let me find the coordinates of X.The equation of BC: we have points B (1, 0) and C (0.7985, 1.139). The slope of BC is approximately -5.65, so the equation is y - 0 = -5.65(x - 1), which is y = -5.65x + 5.65.The altitude AX is y = 0.1768x. To find X, solve:0.1768x = -5.65x + 5.650.1768x + 5.65x = 5.655.8268x = 5.65x ‚âà 5.65 / 5.8268 ‚âà 0.969Then, y ‚âà 0.1768 * 0.969 ‚âà 0.171So, point X is approximately at (0.969, 0.171).Now, we have points C (0.7985, 1.139), H (0.798, 0.141), and X (0.969, 0.171). We need to find angle CHX, which is the angle at H between points C, H, and X.To find angle CHX, we can use vector analysis or coordinate geometry. Let's use vectors.First, find vectors HC and HX.Coordinates of H: (0.798, 0.141)Coordinates of C: (0.7985, 1.139)Coordinates of X: (0.969, 0.171)Vector HC = C - H = (0.7985 - 0.798, 1.139 - 0.141) ‚âà (0.0005, 0.998)Vector HX = X - H = (0.969 - 0.798, 0.171 - 0.141) ‚âà (0.171, 0.03)Now, the angle between vectors HC and HX can be found using the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (HC . HX) / (|HC| |HX|)First, compute the dot product:HC . HX = (0.0005)(0.171) + (0.998)(0.03) ‚âà 0.0000855 + 0.02994 ‚âà 0.03Now, compute |HC|:|HC| = sqrt(0.0005^2 + 0.998^2) ‚âà sqrt(0.00000025 + 0.996) ‚âà sqrt(0.996) ‚âà 0.998Compute |HX|:|HX| = sqrt(0.171^2 + 0.03^2) ‚âà sqrt(0.029241 + 0.0009) ‚âà sqrt(0.030141) ‚âà 0.1736Now, cos(theta) ‚âà 0.03 / (0.998 * 0.1736) ‚âà 0.03 / 0.173 ‚âà 0.173So, theta ‚âà arccos(0.173) ‚âà 80 degrees.Wait, that's interesting. So, angle CHX is approximately 80 degrees. But wait, that doesn't seem right because angle ABC is 80 degrees, and angle CHX is at the orthocenter.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.First, vectors:HC = (0.7985 - 0.798, 1.139 - 0.141) = (0.0005, 0.998)HX = (0.969 - 0.798, 0.171 - 0.141) = (0.171, 0.03)Dot product: 0.0005*0.171 + 0.998*0.03 ‚âà 0.0000855 + 0.02994 ‚âà 0.03|HC|: sqrt(0.0005^2 + 0.998^2) ‚âà sqrt(0.00000025 + 0.996004) ‚âà sqrt(0.996004) ‚âà 0.998|HX|: sqrt(0.171^2 + 0.03^2) ‚âà sqrt(0.029241 + 0.0009) ‚âà sqrt(0.030141) ‚âà 0.1736So, cos(theta) ‚âà 0.03 / (0.998 * 0.1736) ‚âà 0.03 / 0.173 ‚âà 0.173arccos(0.173) ‚âà 80 degrees.Hmm, that seems consistent. But I thought angle CHX might be 45 degrees because angle ACB is 45 degrees. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me think about the properties again. Since angle ACB is 45 degrees, and CH is the altitude, maybe angle CHX relates to that.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates. Let me try a different approach without coordinates.Since angle ACB is 45 degrees, and CH is the altitude, which is perpendicular to AB. So, triangle CHB is a right triangle with angle at H being 90 degrees.In triangle CHB, angle at B is angle HBC. Since angle ABC is 80 degrees, and H is the orthocenter, angle HBC is equal to angle ABC minus angle ABH.Wait, angle ABH is part of angle ABC. Since BY is the altitude, angle ABY is 90 degrees. Wait, no, BY is perpendicular to AC, so angle YBC is 90 degrees.Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H creates angles such that angle BHC = 180 - angle BAC = 125 degrees.So, in triangle BHC, angle BHC = 125 degrees, angle HBC = ?, angle HCB = ?Wait, in triangle BHC, we have angle BHC = 125 degrees, and sides BH and HC.Wait, maybe using the sine law in triangle BHC.But without knowing the sides, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe considering that angle HBC = 90 - angle BAC.Wait, I think there's a property that in a triangle, the angle between a side and the orthocenter is equal to 90 degrees minus the opposite angle.Wait, let me recall: in triangle ABC, angle HBC = 90 - angle BAC.So, angle HBC = 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.Similarly, angle HCB = 90 - angle ABC = 90 - 80 = 10 degrees.Wait, that might be the case. Let me verify.Yes, in a triangle, the angles at the orthocenter satisfy angle HBC = 90 - angle BAC and angle HCB = 90 - angle ABC.So, angle HBC = 35 degrees, angle HCB = 10 degrees.Now, in triangle BHC, we have angle BHC = 125 degrees, angle HBC = 35 degrees, angle HCB = 10 degrees.Now, point X is the foot of the altitude from A to BC. So, in triangle ABC, AX is perpendicular to BC.Now, in triangle CHX, we need to find angle CHX.Wait, maybe considering triangle CHX. We know that CH is perpendicular to AB, and AX is perpendicular to BC.Wait, perhaps using the fact that quadrilateral HXBC is cyclic because both HX and BC are perpendicular to AX and CH respectively.Wait, no, that might not be the case.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angle CHX is equal to angle HBC because of some similar triangles.Wait, angle CHX is at H, between C and X. Since X is on BC, and H is the orthocenter, maybe angle CHX is equal to angle HBC, which is 35 degrees.Wait, but earlier, using coordinates, I got approximately 80 degrees, which contradicts this.Hmm, I must be making a mistake somewhere.Wait, let me think again. Since angle HBC is 35 degrees, and in triangle CHX, angle at H is angle CHX, which might be related.Wait, maybe considering triangle CHX and triangle HBC.Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, another idea: since AX is perpendicular to BC, and CH is perpendicular to AB, maybe the angles formed at H can be related.Wait, in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H creates several right angles. So, maybe angle CHX is equal to angle ACB, which is 45 degrees.Wait, that seems plausible. Let me see.Since angle ACB is 45 degrees, and CH is the altitude, which is perpendicular to AB, maybe angle CHX is 45 degrees.Wait, but earlier, using coordinates, I got approximately 80 degrees, which is different.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate calculations. Let me check again.Wait, in the coordinate system, point H was at (0.798, 0.141), point C at (0.7985, 1.139), and point X at (0.969, 0.171).So, vector HC is (0.0005, 0.998), and vector HX is (0.171, 0.03).The angle between these vectors was calculated as approximately 80 degrees. But according to the property, angle CHX should be 45 degrees.Wait, maybe the property is that angle CHX is equal to angle ACB, which is 45 degrees. So, perhaps my coordinate calculation was incorrect.Wait, let me try to calculate the angle again more accurately.Vectors:HC = (0.7985 - 0.798, 1.139 - 0.141) = (0.0005, 0.998)HX = (0.969 - 0.798, 0.171 - 0.141) = (0.171, 0.03)Dot product: (0.0005)(0.171) + (0.998)(0.03) = 0.0000855 + 0.02994 ‚âà 0.03|HC| = sqrt(0.0005¬≤ + 0.998¬≤) ‚âà sqrt(0.00000025 + 0.996004) ‚âà 0.998|HX| = sqrt(0.171¬≤ + 0.03¬≤) ‚âà sqrt(0.029241 + 0.0009) ‚âà sqrt(0.030141) ‚âà 0.1736So, cos(theta) = 0.03 / (0.998 * 0.1736) ‚âà 0.03 / 0.173 ‚âà 0.173arccos(0.173) ‚âà 80 degrees.Hmm, so according to this, angle CHX is approximately 80 degrees, but according to the property, it should be 45 degrees. There's a contradiction here.Wait, maybe the property I recalled earlier is incorrect. Let me double-check.I thought that angle HBC = 90 - angle BAC, which would be 35 degrees, and angle HCB = 90 - angle ABC, which would be 10 degrees. Then, in triangle BHC, angles would be 125, 35, and 10 degrees.But if angle HBC is 35 degrees, and angle CHX is related, maybe angle CHX is equal to angle HBC, which is 35 degrees. But that contradicts both the coordinate calculation and the earlier thought that it's 45 degrees.Wait, maybe I need to consider another approach. Let me think about the cyclic quadrilaterals formed by the orthocenter.In triangle ABC, the orthocenter H creates cyclic quadrilaterals such as AHBX, BHXC, etc., because of the right angles.Wait, specifically, since AX is perpendicular to BC and CH is perpendicular to AB, points A, H, X, and the foot of the altitude from C lie on a circle. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe considering that quadrilateral HXBC is cyclic because angles at X and H are right angles.Wait, if HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX would be equal to angle CBA, which is 80 degrees. But that contradicts the earlier thought.Wait, no, if HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX would be equal to angle CBA because they subtend the same arc.But angle CBA is 80 degrees, which matches the coordinate calculation.Wait, so maybe angle CHX is 80 degrees.But earlier, I thought it might be 45 degrees because angle ACB is 45 degrees.Wait, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify.If quadrilateral HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.But how can we be sure that HXBC is cyclic?Well, since both HX and BC are perpendicular to AX and CH respectively, which are altitudes, maybe they form right angles with the sides, making the quadrilateral cyclic.Wait, actually, for a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. Since both angles at X and H are 90 degrees, their sum is 180 degrees, so quadrilateral HXBC is indeed cyclic.Therefore, angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.Wait, but earlier, using the property that angle HBC = 90 - angle BAC = 35 degrees, and in triangle CHX, angle at H is angle CHX, which might be related.Wait, but if quadrilateral HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.So, that would mean angle CHX is 80 degrees.But earlier, using the coordinate method, I got approximately 80 degrees, which aligns with this.But then, why did I think it might be 45 degrees? Maybe I confused it with another angle.Wait, angle ACB is 45 degrees, which is angle at C. But angle CHX is at H, so it's a different angle.Therefore, the correct answer should be 80 degrees.Wait, but let me confirm with another method.Another approach: Since HXBC is cyclic, angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.Yes, that makes sense.So, the answer is 80 degrees.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a solution that concluded angle CHX is 45 degrees. But according to my calculations and reasoning, it's 80 degrees.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that HXBC is cyclic. Let me think again.Quadrilateral HXBC has two right angles at X and H. Therefore, it is cyclic because the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees (90 + 90 = 180). Therefore, angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the correct answer is 80 degrees.Wait, but the initial solution provided by the user concluded 45 degrees. Maybe that was incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cyclic quadrilateral approach.Wait, let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral again. If HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX = angle CBA because they subtend the same arc.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, angle CHX = angle ABC = 80 degrees.So, the answer should be 80 degrees.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a solution that concluded 45 degrees. Maybe that was a mistake.Alternatively, perhaps the problem was misstated. Let me check the original problem again.\\"Altitudes AX and BY of acute triangle ABC intersect at H. If angle BAC = 55 degrees and angle ABC = 80 degrees, then what is angle CHX?\\"So, angle CHX is at H, between C and X.Given that, and considering the cyclic quadrilateral HXBC, angle CHX should be equal to angle CBA, which is 80 degrees.Therefore, the correct answer is 80 degrees.But wait, in the initial solution, the user concluded 45 degrees, which is angle ACB. Maybe they confused angle CHX with angle ACB.Alternatively, maybe the problem was to find angle XCH instead of CHX.Wait, angle XCH would be at C, between X and H. In that case, angle XCH would be equal to angle ACB, which is 45 degrees.But the problem asks for angle CHX, which is at H.Therefore, the correct answer is 80 degrees.But wait, let me think again. If HXBC is cyclic, then angle CHX = angle CBA = 80 degrees.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the answer should be 80 degrees.But the initial solution provided by the user concluded 45 degrees, which is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the problem was to find angle XCH, which would be 45 degrees.But the problem specifically asks for angle CHX.Therefore, the correct answer is 80 degrees.Wait, but in the coordinate calculation, I got approximately 80 degrees, which aligns with this.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 80 degrees."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, with the origin O as the pole and the non-negative half-axis of x as the polar axis, a polar coordinate system is established.

Let me try to break this down step by step.First, part (1) asks for the general equation of curve C‚ÇÅ and the Cartesian equation of curve C‚ÇÇ. Let me start with C‚ÇÅ.C‚ÇÅ is given parametrically with x = 2‚àö2 cos Œ± and y = 2 sin Œ±. I remember that parametric equations can often be converted to Cartesian form by eliminating the parameter, which in this case is Œ±. So, I need to express cos Œ± and sin Œ± in terms of x and y and then use the Pythagorean identity.From x = 2‚àö2 cos Œ±, I can solve for cos Œ±: cos Œ± = x / (2‚àö2). Similarly, from y = 2 sin Œ±, sin Œ± = y / 2.Now, I know that cos¬≤ Œ± + sin¬≤ Œ± = 1. So, substituting the expressions I found:(x / (2‚àö2))¬≤ + (y / 2)¬≤ = 1Let me compute that:(x¬≤) / (8) + (y¬≤) / 4 = 1So, that's the general equation of C‚ÇÅ. It looks like an ellipse with semi-major axis 2‚àö2 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the y-axis. Okay, that seems right.Now, moving on to C‚ÇÇ. Its polar equation is given as œÅ cos Œ∏ - ‚àö2 œÅ sin Œ∏ - 5 = 0. I need to convert this to Cartesian coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, œÅ cos Œ∏ is x and œÅ sin Œ∏ is y. So, substituting these into the equation:x - ‚àö2 y - 5 = 0So, that's the Cartesian equation of C‚ÇÇ. It's a straight line. Let me write that down:x - ‚àö2 y - 5 = 0Alright, part (1) seems done. Now, part (2) is a bit trickier. I need to find the minimum value of |PQ| where P is on C‚ÇÅ and Q is on C‚ÇÇ. So, essentially, I need the minimum distance between a point on the ellipse and a point on the line.I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to a line ax + by + c = 0 is given by |ax + by + c| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤). But in this case, since both P and Q are variable points on their respective curves, it's not just the distance from a fixed point to the line, but the minimum distance between any two points on the curves.Wait, but maybe I can think of it as the minimum distance from the ellipse to the line. Because if I can find the minimum distance from the ellipse to the line, that should be the minimum |PQ|.Alternatively, I can parametrize point P on the ellipse and then find the distance from P to the line, then minimize that distance with respect to the parameter Œ±. That seems feasible.Let me try that approach.So, let's denote point P on C‚ÇÅ as (2‚àö2 cos Œ±, 2 sin Œ±). Then, the distance from P to the line C‚ÇÇ: x - ‚àö2 y - 5 = 0 is given by:d(Œ±) = |(2‚àö2 cos Œ±) - ‚àö2*(2 sin Œ±) - 5| / sqrt(1¬≤ + (‚àö2)¬≤)Let me compute the denominator first: sqrt(1 + 2) = sqrt(3). So, denominator is ‚àö3.Now, the numerator is |2‚àö2 cos Œ± - 2‚àö2 sin Œ± - 5|. Let me factor out 2‚àö2 from the first two terms:|2‚àö2 (cos Œ± - sin Œ±) - 5|Hmm, maybe I can write cos Œ± - sin Œ± as a single trigonometric function. I remember that expressions like A cos Œ± + B sin Œ± can be written as C cos(Œ± + œÜ), where C = sqrt(A¬≤ + B¬≤) and tan œÜ = B/A.In this case, cos Œ± - sin Œ± is like 1*cos Œ± + (-1)*sin Œ±, so A = 1, B = -1. Therefore, C = sqrt(1 + 1) = ‚àö2, and tan œÜ = (-1)/1 = -1, so œÜ = -œÄ/4 or 7œÄ/4.Therefore, cos Œ± - sin Œ± = ‚àö2 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4). Let me verify that:‚àö2 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) = ‚àö2 [cos Œ± cos œÄ/4 - sin Œ± sin œÄ/4] = ‚àö2 [ (cos Œ±)(‚àö2/2) - (sin Œ±)(‚àö2/2) ] = ‚àö2*(‚àö2/2)(cos Œ± - sin Œ±) = (2/2)(cos Œ± - sin Œ±) = cos Œ± - sin Œ±. Perfect.So, substituting back into the numerator:|2‚àö2 * ‚àö2 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) - 5| = |4 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) - 5|Therefore, the distance d(Œ±) becomes:|4 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) - 5| / ‚àö3Now, to find the minimum distance, we need to minimize d(Œ±). Since the denominator is a constant (‚àö3), we can focus on minimizing the numerator |4 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) - 5|.The expression inside the absolute value is 4 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4) - 5. Let's denote Œ∏ = Œ± + œÄ/4 for simplicity. Then, the expression becomes 4 cos Œ∏ - 5.We need to find the minimum of |4 cos Œ∏ - 5|. Since cos Œ∏ varies between -1 and 1, 4 cos Œ∏ varies between -4 and 4. Therefore, 4 cos Œ∏ - 5 varies between -9 and -1. So, the expression inside the absolute value is always negative, because 4 cos Œ∏ - 5 ‚â§ 4*1 -5 = -1 < 0. Therefore, |4 cos Œ∏ - 5| = 5 - 4 cos Œ∏.So, now, the distance becomes:(5 - 4 cos Œ∏) / ‚àö3To minimize this, we need to minimize (5 - 4 cos Œ∏). Since cos Œ∏ has a maximum value of 1, the minimum of (5 - 4 cos Œ∏) occurs when cos Œ∏ is maximized, i.e., when cos Œ∏ = 1.Therefore, the minimum distance is:(5 - 4*1) / ‚àö3 = (5 - 4)/‚àö3 = 1/‚àö3 = ‚àö3 / 3So, the minimum value of |PQ| is ‚àö3 / 3.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Converted parametric equations to Cartesian: correct, got x¬≤/8 + y¬≤/4 = 1.2. Converted polar equation to Cartesian: correct, x - ‚àö2 y -5 = 0.3. For the distance, used the distance from a point to a line formula: correct.4. Expressed cos Œ± - sin Œ± as ‚àö2 cos(Œ± + œÄ/4): correct.5. Simplified the numerator to |4 cos(Œ∏) -5|, realized it's always negative, so took absolute value as 5 -4 cos Œ∏: correct.6. Minimized 5 -4 cos Œ∏ by maximizing cos Œ∏, which is 1: correct.7. Calculated the minimum distance as (5 -4)/‚àö3 = 1/‚àö3 = ‚àö3 /3: correct.Seems solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.**Final Answer**The minimum value of (|PQ|) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}}."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:_,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},L={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],D={key:0},M={key:1};function z(a,e,h,d,n,o){const u=b("PoemCard");return i(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ DeepSeek-R1 ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",L,[(i(!0),s(y,null,w(o.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(i(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(i(),s("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),s("span",D,"See more"))],8,W)):v("",!0)])}const Q=m(F,[["render",z],["__scopeId","data-v-fd0aa24d"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/53.md","filePath":"glossary/53.md"}'),N={name:"glossary/53.md"},R=Object.assign(N,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),s("div",null,[S(Q)]))}});export{O as __pageData,R as default};
