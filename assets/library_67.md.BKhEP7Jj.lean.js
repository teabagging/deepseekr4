Hmm, that looks a bit tricky at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about what each part means.First, (arcsin frac{8}{17}) is the angle whose sine is (frac{8}{17}). So, if I let (theta = arcsin frac{8}{17}), then (sin theta = frac{8}{17}). Got that part. Now, I need to find (cos theta). So, essentially, I need to find the cosine of an angle whose sine is (frac{8}{17}).I remember there's a Pythagorean identity that relates sine and cosine: (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1). Maybe I can use that to find (cos theta). Let me write that down:[sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1]Since I know (sin theta = frac{8}{17}), I can substitute that in:[left(frac{8}{17}right)^2 + cos^2 theta = 1]Calculating (left(frac{8}{17}right)^2):[frac{64}{289} + cos^2 theta = 1]Now, subtract (frac{64}{289}) from both sides to solve for (cos^2 theta):[cos^2 theta = 1 - frac{64}{289}]Calculating (1 - frac{64}{289}):First, express 1 as (frac{289}{289}):[cos^2 theta = frac{289}{289} - frac{64}{289} = frac{225}{289}]So, (cos^2 theta = frac{225}{289}). To find (cos theta), I take the square root of both sides:[cos theta = sqrt{frac{225}{289}} = frac{sqrt{225}}{sqrt{289}} = frac{15}{17}]Wait a second, but cosine can be positive or negative, right? So, do I need to consider the sign here? Hmm, let's think about the angle (theta). Since (theta = arcsin frac{8}{17}), and the arcsine function returns angles in the range (-frac{pi}{2}) to (frac{pi}{2}), which is the fourth and first quadrants. In these quadrants, cosine is positive. So, (cos theta) must be positive. Therefore, (cos theta = frac{15}{17}).So, putting it all together, (cos left( arcsin frac{8}{17} right) = frac{15}{17}).Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me visualize this. If (sin theta = frac{8}{17}), then in a right triangle, the opposite side is 8, and the hypotenuse is 17. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the adjacent side should be (sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = sqrt{289 - 64} = sqrt{225} = 15). Therefore, (cos theta = frac{15}{17}), which matches what I found earlier.I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is (frac{15}{17})."},{"question":"Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 1 and 15, inclusive.

There are 8 odd integers between 1 and 15, so the number of ways to choose two odd integers is (binom{8}{2} = 28).The number of ways to choose at least one even integer is the total number of ways minus the number of ways to choose two odd integers: (105 - 28 = 77).Finally, the probability that the product of the two chosen integers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: (dfrac{77}{105})."},{"question":"What is the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 5?","answer":"First, I need to identify all the two-digit multiples of 5.

The options are (A) sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"x geqslant 1\\", (B) necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"x geqslant 1\\", (C) both necessary and sufficient condition for \\"x geqslant 1\\", and (D) neither necessary nor sufficient condition for \\"x geqslant 1\\". I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me recall what necessary and sufficient conditions mean. A necessary condition is something that must be true for another statement to be true. On the other hand, a sufficient condition is something that, if it's true, guarantees that another statement is true. If a condition is both necessary and sufficient, then it means that the two statements imply each other.So, in this case, the main statement is \\"x geqslant 1\\". The condition given is \\"x > 1\\". I need to see if \\"x > 1\\" is a necessary condition, a sufficient condition, both, or neither for \\"x geqslant 1\\".Let me think about sufficiency first. If \\"x > 1\\", does that guarantee that \\"x geqslant 1\\"? Well, yes, because if x is greater than 1, it's certainly greater than or equal to 1. So, \\"x > 1\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x geqslant 1\\".Now, is it a necessary condition? That would mean that if \\"x geqslant 1\\", then \\"x > 1\\" must be true. But wait, if x is equal to 1, then \\"x geqslant 1\\" is true, but \\"x > 1\\" is false. So, \\"x > 1\\" isn't a necessary condition because there are cases where \\"x geqslant 1\\" is true without \\"x > 1\\" being true.Therefore, \\"x > 1\\" is sufficient but not necessary for \\"x geqslant 1\\". So, the answer should be option (A).Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I consider x = 1, then \\"x geqslant 1\\" is true, but \\"x > 1\\" is false. This confirms that \\"x > 1\\" isn't necessary. And since any x > 1 will definitely satisfy x ≥ 1, it's sufficient.

How many tiles will you need in total?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to make the smallest possible square using rectangular tiles that are 12 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters tall. I can't overlap the tiles, and I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need in total. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that a square has all sides equal, so the length and width of the square must be the same. Since I'm using rectangular tiles, I need to arrange them in such a way that their combined dimensions form a square. The tiles are 12 cm wide and 15 cm tall, so I need to find a common multiple of these two dimensions that will give me the side length of the square.I remember that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So, maybe I should find the LCM of 12 and 15 to determine the smallest possible side length of the square.Let me try to find the LCM of 12 and 15. To do that, I can use prime factorization. - 12 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 3, which is 2² * 3.- 15 can be factored into 3 * 5.Now, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:- For 2, the highest power is 2².- For 3, the highest power is 3¹.- For 5, the highest power is 5¹.So, the LCM is 2² * 3¹ * 5¹ = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.Okay, so the smallest square I can make will have a side length of 60 cm. Now, I need to figure out how many tiles I need to cover this square.First, let's calculate the area of the square:Area of square = side length * side length = 60 cm * 60 cm = 3600 cm².Next, let's find the area of one tile:Area of one tile = width * height = 12 cm * 15 cm = 180 cm².Now, to find out how many tiles are needed, I can divide the area of the square by the area of one tile:Number of tiles = Area of square / Area of one tile = 3600 cm² / 180 cm² = 20.So, I would need 20 tiles to make the smallest possible square without any overlap.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The LCM of 12 and 15 is indeed 60, and the area calculations seem correct. 60 cm by 60 cm is 3600 cm², and each tile is 180 cm², so 3600 divided by 180 is 20. Yeah, that seems right.I think I've got it. The smallest square I can make with these tiles is 60 cm on each side, and I need 20 tiles to do that."},{"question":"Cindy can run at 3 miles per hour and walk at 1 mile per hour.

What is the distance she runs and walks in miles?","answer":"First, I need to determine the distance Cindy runs and walks, which I'll denote as ( d ) miles.Cindy runs at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time it takes her to run this distance is calculated by dividing the distance by her running speed:[text{Time to run} = frac{d}{3} text{ hours}]Next, Cindy walks at a speed of 1 mile per hour. The time it takes her to walk the same distance is:[text{Time to walk} = frac{d}{1} text{ hours} = d text{ hours}]The total time for both running and walking is 40 minutes. Since the speeds are given in miles per hour, I need to convert 40 minutes into hours:[frac{40}{60} text{ hours} = frac{2}{3} text{ hours}]Now, I can set up the equation for the total time:[frac{d}{3} + d = frac{2}{3}]To solve for ( d ), I'll find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 3:[frac{d}{3} + frac{3d}{3} = frac{2}{3}]Combining the terms on the left side:[frac{4d}{3} = frac{2}{3}]Multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of (frac{4}{3}), which is (frac{3}{4}):[d = frac{2}{3} times frac{3}{4} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}]Therefore, Cindy runs and walks a distance of ( frac{1}{2} ) mile each."},{"question":"if the sides of a triangle are 26 cm , 18 cm and 10 cm , what is its area ?","answer":"First, I need to determine if the given sides can form a valid triangle.

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but maybe I can figure this out step by step.First, I remember that sometimes plugging in specific values for ( x ) or ( y ) can simplify the equation and give me some clues about the form of ( f ). Let me try setting ( x = 0 ). If I do that, the equation becomes:( f(0 + y) - f(0 - y) = 2y(3(0)^2 + y^2) )Simplifying, that's:( f(y) - f(-y) = 2y^3 )Interesting. So the difference between ( f(y) ) and ( f(-y) ) is ( 2y^3 ). That suggests that ( f ) might have an odd component, since ( f(y) - f(-y) ) is non-zero. Let me think about what functions have that property.If I suppose that ( f(y) ) has a term like ( y^3 ), which is an odd function, then maybe that could satisfy the equation. Let me test this idea.Let me assume that ( f(x) = x^3 + g(x) ), where ( g(x) ) is some function I need to determine. If I plug this into the original equation, I get:( f(x+y) - f(x-y) = ( (x+y)^3 + g(x+y) ) - ( (x-y)^3 + g(x-y) ) )Simplify that:( (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 + g(x+y) - g(x-y) )I know that ( (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 ) can be expanded. Let me compute that:( (x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3 )( (x-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 - y^3 )Subtracting these:( (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 = 6x^2 y + 2y^3 )So, plugging that back into the equation:( 6x^2 y + 2y^3 + g(x+y) - g(x-y) = 2y(3x^2 + y^2) )Simplify the right side:( 6x^2 y + 2y^3 )So, the equation becomes:( 6x^2 y + 2y^3 + g(x+y) - g(x-y) = 6x^2 y + 2y^3 )Subtracting ( 6x^2 y + 2y^3 ) from both sides:( g(x+y) - g(x-y) = 0 )This implies that ( g(x+y) = g(x-y) ) for all ( x ) and ( y ). Hmm, what does that tell me about ( g )?If I fix ( x ) and vary ( y ), then ( g ) must be the same for all arguments ( x+y ) and ( x-y ). That suggests that ( g ) is a constant function. Let me check that.Suppose ( g(x) = c ) where ( c ) is a constant. Then ( g(x+y) - g(x-y) = c - c = 0 ), which satisfies the equation. So, ( g ) must be a constant.Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) is ( x^3 + c ), where ( c ) is a constant. Let me verify this solution to make sure it works.Let ( f(x) = x^3 + c ). Then:( f(x+y) - f(x-y) = ( (x+y)^3 + c ) - ( (x-y)^3 + c ) )Simplify:( (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 )Which, as I computed earlier, is ( 6x^2 y + 2y^3 ). Now, the right side of the original equation is:( 2y(3x^2 + y^2) = 6x^2 y + 2y^3 )So, both sides are equal, which means ( f(x) = x^3 + c ) is indeed a solution.Wait, but is this the only solution? I assumed that ( f(x) = x^3 + g(x) ) and found that ( g ) must be constant. So, it seems like any function of the form ( x^3 + c ) will satisfy the equation, and there are no other solutions.Let me think if there's another approach to confirm this. Maybe differentiating both sides with respect to ( y ) or something like that. But since the equation holds for all ( x ) and ( y ), differentiation might be a valid approach.Let me try differentiating both sides with respect to ( y ):Left side: ( frac{d}{dy}[f(x+y) - f(x-y)] = f'(x+y) + f'(x-y) )Right side: ( frac{d}{dy}[2y(3x^2 + y^2)] = 2(3x^2 + y^2) + 2y(2y) = 6x^2 + 2y^2 + 4y^2 = 6x^2 + 6y^2 )So, we have:( f'(x+y) + f'(x-y) = 6x^2 + 6y^2 )Hmm, this is another functional equation for the derivative ( f' ). Maybe I can solve this.Let me set ( u = x + y ) and ( v = x - y ). Then, ( x = frac{u + v}{2} ) and ( y = frac{u - v}{2} ). Substituting into the equation:( f'(u) + f'(v) = 6left( frac{u + v}{2} right)^2 + 6left( frac{u - v}{2} right)^2 )Simplify the right side:First, compute ( left( frac{u + v}{2} right)^2 = frac{(u + v)^2}{4} = frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2}{4} )Similarly, ( left( frac{u - v}{2} right)^2 = frac{u^2 - 2uv + v^2}{4} )Adding these together:( frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2}{4} + frac{u^2 - 2uv + v^2}{4} = frac{2u^2 + 2v^2}{4} = frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} )Multiply by 6:( 6 times frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = 3u^2 + 3v^2 )So, the equation becomes:( f'(u) + f'(v) = 3u^2 + 3v^2 )This must hold for all ( u ) and ( v ). Let me consider setting ( u = v ). Then:( 2f'(u) = 3u^2 + 3u^2 = 6u^2 )So, ( f'(u) = 3u^2 )Integrating both sides with respect to ( u ):( f(u) = u^3 + C ), where ( C ) is a constant.This confirms that ( f(x) = x^3 + C ) is indeed the general solution. So, whether I approach it by assuming the form of ( f ) or by differentiating the original equation, I end up with the same result.Just to make sure, let me test this solution again. If ( f(x) = x^3 + C ), then:( f(x+y) - f(x-y) = (x+y)^3 + C - [(x-y)^3 + C] = (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 )Expanding both cubes:( (x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3 )( (x-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 - y^3 )Subtracting:( (x+y)^3 - (x-y)^3 = 6x^2 y + 2y^3 )Which is equal to ( 2y(3x^2 + y^2) ), as required.So, everything checks out. I think I've found the correct solution.**Final Answer**The function ( f ) is given by ( boxed{f(x) = x^3 + C} ) where ( C ) is a constant."},{"question":"A train 100 m long takes some time to cross a man walking at 5 kmph in a direction opposite to that of the train.

Let me take it step by step.First, the hyperbola is given by the equation Γ: x²/a² - y² = 1. **Problem 1:** If the point (2,1) lies on Γ, find the coordinates of the foci of Γ.Alright, so I know that for a hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². In this case, the equation is x²/a² - y² = 1, which means b² = 1. So, c² = a² + 1.But first, I need to find the value of 'a' because the point (2,1) is on the hyperbola. Let me substitute x = 2 and y = 1 into the equation to find 'a'.So, substituting:(2)² / a² - (1)² = 1Which simplifies to:4 / a² - 1 = 1Adding 1 to both sides:4 / a² = 2Then, multiplying both sides by a²:4 = 2a²Divide both sides by 2:a² = 2So, a = sqrt(2). But since a is a real number, it can be positive or negative, but in the context of hyperbola equations, a is usually taken as positive. So, a = sqrt(2).Now, let's find c. Since c² = a² + b², and b² = 1, we have:c² = 2 + 1 = 3So, c = sqrt(3). Therefore, the foci are at (±sqrt(3), 0).Wait, let me double-check that. If a² is 2, then c² is 2 + 1 = 3, so c is sqrt(3).

So, let's substitute y from the line equation into the hyperbola equation.Substituting y = kx + 1 into x² - y² = 1:x² - (kx + 1)² = 1Let me expand (kx + 1)²:(kx + 1)² = k²x² + 2kx + 1So, substituting back:x² - (k²x² + 2kx + 1) = 1Simplify:x² - k²x² - 2kx - 1 = 1Combine like terms:(1 - k²)x² - 2kx - 2 = 0So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of x: (1 - k²)x² - 2kx - 2 = 0Let me denote this as Ax² + Bx + C = 0, where:A = (1 - k²)B = -2kC = -2Now, since the line intersects the hyperbola at two points A and B, this quadratic equation will have two real solutions.

So, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is (x1 + x2)/2 = (-B/A)/2 = (-B)/(2A)Given that the x-coordinate of the midpoint is 1, we have:(-B)/(2A) = 1Substitute B and A:(-(-2k)) / (2*(1 - k²)) = 1Simplify numerator:2k / (2*(1 - k²)) = 1The 2's cancel out:k / (1 - k²) = 1So, we have:k = 1 - k²Bring all terms to one side:k² + k - 1 = 0This is a quadratic equation in k. Let's solve for k.Using the quadratic formula:k = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 1, b = 1, c = -1So,k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)] / 2k = [-1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2So, we have two possible solutions:k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 and k = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2But we need to check if these values of k are valid. Since the line intersects the hyperbola at two points, the quadratic equation must have two real roots, which requires the discriminant to be positive.The discriminant D of the quadratic equation (1 - k²)x² - 2kx - 2 = 0 is:D = B² - 4AC = (-2k)² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2) = 4k² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2)Wait, let me compute that again:D = B² - 4AC = ( -2k )² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2) = 4k² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2)Compute 4*(1 - k²)*(-2):= 4*(-2)*(1 - k²) = -8*(1 - k²) = -8 + 8k²So, D = 4k² - (-8 + 8k²) = 4k² + 8 - 8k² = -4k² + 8For the quadratic to have real roots, D > 0:-4k² + 8 > 0-4k² > -8Multiply both sides by (-1), which reverses the inequality:4k² < 8k² < 2So, |k| < sqrt(2)Now, let's check the two solutions:1. k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618Which is less than sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so it's valid.2. k = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ (-3.236)/2 ≈ -1.618Which is less than -sqrt(2) ≈ -1.414, so |k| = 1.618 > sqrt(2), which is not valid because we need |k| < sqrt(2). Therefore, this solution is invalid.So, only k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 is valid.Wait, let me confirm that calculation. When I calculated D, I think I might have made a mistake.Wait, let's recalculate D:D = B² - 4AC = (-2k)² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2) = 4k² - 4*(1 - k²)*(-2)Compute 4*(1 - k²)*(-2):= 4*(-2)*(1 - k²) = -8*(1 - k²) = -8 + 8k²So, D = 4k² - (-8 + 8k²) = 4k² + 8 - 8k² = -4k² + 8Yes, that's correct. So, D = -4k² + 8 > 0 ⇒ k² < 2 ⇒ |k| < sqrt(2)So, k must be between -sqrt(2) and sqrt(2). Now, let's compute the numerical values:sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236So,k1 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1.236)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is within (-sqrt(2), sqrt(2)).k2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-3.236)/2 ≈ -1.618, which is less than -sqrt(2) ≈ -1.414, so it's outside the valid range.Therefore, only k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 is valid.Wait, but let me think again. When I solved for k, I got k = (-1 ± sqrt(5))/2. So, the positive solution is approximately 0.618, which is valid, and the negative solution is approximately -1.618, which is less than -sqrt(2) ≈ -1.414, so it's invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.But let me check if I made any mistake in the earlier steps.When I substituted y = kx + 1 into x² - y² = 1, I got x² - (k²x² + 2kx + 1) = 1, which simplifies to (1 - k²)x² - 2kx - 2 = 0. That seems correct.Then, the sum of roots is -B/A = (2k)/(1 - k²). The midpoint's x-coordinate is half of that, so (2k)/(2*(1 - k²)) = k/(1 - k²) = 1. So, k = 1 - k² ⇒ k² + k - 1 = 0. That seems correct.Solving that quadratic gives k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(5)]/2. That's correct.Then, checking the discriminant, I found that k must be between -sqrt(2) and sqrt(2). So, only k = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 is valid.Wait, but let me compute sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1.236)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is less than sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so it's valid.The other solution is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-3.236)/2 ≈ -1.618, which is less than -sqrt(2), so it's invalid.Therefore, the value of k is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.I think that's correct."},{"question":"Compute the value of frac{0.overline{63}}{0.overline{84}} and express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.","answer":"First, I need to convert the repeating decimals (0.overline{63}) and (0.overline{84}) into fractions.

If a+c = 35, and a < c, find the ordered pair (a, c).","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( ax^2 + 30x + c = 0 ). The problem says it has exactly one solution. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant is ( b^2 - 4ac ). In this case, ( b ) is 30, so let me write that down.Discriminant ( = 30^2 - 4ac = 0 ). Calculating ( 30^2 ), that's 900. So, ( 900 - 4ac = 0 ). If I rearrange this, I get ( 4ac = 900 ). Dividing both sides by 4, I find ( ac = 225 ). Okay, so the product of ( a ) and ( c ) is 225.The problem also gives me that ( a + c = 35 ). So now I have two equations:1. ( a + c = 35 )2. ( ac = 225 )I need to find the values of ( a ) and ( c ). Since ( a < c ), I know that ( a ) is the smaller number and ( c ) is the larger one.I think I can use these two equations to solve for ( a ) and ( c ). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute. Let me try that.From the first equation, ( a = 35 - c ). Now, substitute this into the second equation:( (35 - c)c = 225 )Expanding this, I get:( 35c - c^2 = 225 )Rearranging the terms:( -c^2 + 35c - 225 = 0 )Multiplying both sides by -1 to make it a standard quadratic equation:( c^2 - 35c + 225 = 0 )Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of ( c ). Let me try to solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is ( c = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). Wait, that's confusing because the variables here are the same as in the original equation. Maybe I should use different letters for clarity.Let me rewrite the quadratic equation as ( c^2 - 35c + 225 = 0 ). So, in this case, the coefficients are:- ( A = 1 ) (coefficient of ( c^2 ))- ( B = -35 ) (coefficient of ( c ))- ( C = 225 ) (constant term)Applying the quadratic formula:( c = frac{-B pm sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} )Plugging in the values:( c = frac{-(-35) pm sqrt{(-35)^2 - 4(1)(225)}}{2(1)} )Simplify:( c = frac{35 pm sqrt{1225 - 900}}{2} )Calculating inside the square root:( 1225 - 900 = 325 )So,( c = frac{35 pm sqrt{325}}{2} )Hmm, ( sqrt{325} ) can be simplified. Let me see, 325 is 25 times 13, so ( sqrt{325} = sqrt{25 times 13} = 5sqrt{13} ).Therefore, the solutions are:( c = frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} ) and ( c = frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2} )Since ( a < c ), and ( a + c = 35 ), the larger value of ( c ) would correspond to the larger solution. So, ( c = frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} ) and ( a = frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2} ).Let me double-check to make sure these values satisfy both equations.First, check ( a + c ):( frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2} + frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} = frac{35 - 5sqrt{13} + 35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} = frac{70}{2} = 35 ). That works.Next, check ( ac ):Multiply ( a ) and ( c ):( left( frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2} right) left( frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} right) )This is a difference of squares, so:( frac{(35)^2 - (5sqrt{13})^2}{4} = frac{1225 - 25 times 13}{4} )Calculating ( 25 times 13 = 325 ), so:( frac{1225 - 325}{4} = frac{900}{4} = 225 ). Perfect, that's correct.So, the ordered pair ( (a, c) ) is ( left( frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2}, frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} right) ).I think that's the solution. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything.1. Recognized that a single solution implies discriminant is zero.2. Calculated discriminant ( 900 - 4ac = 0 ) leading to ( ac = 225 ).3. Used the given ( a + c = 35 ) to set up a system of equations.4. Expressed ( a ) in terms of ( c ) and substituted into the product equation.5. Solved the resulting quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.6. Simplified the square root and found the two possible values for ( c ).7. Determined which value corresponds to ( c ) based on ( a < c ).8. Verified both the sum and product to ensure correctness.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or logic. So, I'm confident that this is the correct ordered pair.**Final Answer**The ordered pair is boxed{left( frac{35 - 5sqrt{13}}{2}, frac{35 + 5sqrt{13}}{2} right)}."},{"question":"A local community group deposited money into a savings account that earns simple interest.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The function is given as f(x) = x² - 4x + 4 + k². Hmm, that looks like a quadratic function. Maybe I can rewrite it in a more familiar form to get a better grasp.Let me complete the square for the quadratic part. So, x² - 4x + 4. Completing the square, that would be (x - 2)², right? Because (x - 2)² = x² - 4x + 4. So, the function simplifies to f(x) = (x - 2)² + k². Okay, that makes it clearer. So, it's a parabola that opens upwards with its vertex at (2, k²). Now, the problem says that if there exists a triangle with sides f(a), f(b), and f(c) for any a, b, c in the interval [0, 3], then we need to find the possible values of k. The options are k = 1, 2, 3, 4.First, I need to recall the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. So, for any a, b, c in [0, 3], the following must hold:1. f(a) + f(b) > f(c)2. f(a) + f(c) > f(b)3. f(b) + f(c) > f(a)Since this has to hold for any a, b, c in [0, 3], I need to ensure that the function f(x) doesn't produce values that violate these inequalities. Let me analyze the function f(x) = (x - 2)² + k² on the interval [0, 3]. Since it's a parabola opening upwards, the minimum value occurs at the vertex x = 2. So, f(2) = (2 - 2)² + k² = k². Now, what about the maximum value on [0, 3]? Since the parabola opens upwards, the maximum will occur at one of the endpoints. Let's compute f(0) and f(3):- f(0) = (0 - 2)² + k² = 4 + k²- f(3) = (3 - 2)² + k² = 1 + k²So, the maximum value of f(x) on [0, 3] is f(0) = 4 + k², and the minimum is f(2) = k².Now, considering the triangle inequality, the most critical case would be when two sides are as small as possible and one side is as large as possible. That is, we need to ensure that 2 * minimum side > maximum side. Otherwise, the two smaller sides wouldn't be able to form a triangle with the largest side.So, substituting the values we have:2 * f(2) > f(0)2 * k² > 4 + k²Let me solve this inequality:2k² > 4 + k²Subtract k² from both sides:k² > 4So, k² > 4 implies that k > 2 or k < -2. But since k is a real number and the options given are positive (1, 2, 3, 4), we can ignore the negative values. Therefore, k must be greater than 2.Looking at the options, k = 3 and k = 4 satisfy this condition. So, the possible values of k are 3 and 4.I should double-check to make sure there aren't any other conditions I missed. For instance, are there other combinations of a, b, c where the triangle inequality might fail? But since the function is continuous and we've ensured that the smallest two sides can always form a triangle with the largest side, I think this covers all cases. Therefore, the correct answers should be options C and D, which are k = 3 and k = 4."},{"question":"As shown in the diagram, a rectangular grassland is divided into three parts.

The area of the third part is 650 square meters. What is the area of the first part in square meters?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a rectangular grassland that's divided into three parts. The second part is 10 meters wider than the first part, and the third part is 4 meters narrower than the first part. The areas of the second and third parts are given as 1000 square meters and 650 square meters, respectively. I need to find the area of the first part.Okay, let's start by visualizing this. There's a big rectangle, and it's been split into three smaller rectangles. All three smaller rectangles share the same length because they're parts of the same big rectangle. The widths of these smaller rectangles are different, though. The second one is wider than the first by 10 meters, and the third one is narrower than the first by 4 meters.Let me denote the width of the first part as 'a' meters. Then, the width of the second part would be 'a + 10' meters, and the width of the third part would be 'a - 4' meters.Since all three parts have the same length, let's call that length 'L' meters. So, the area of each part would be width multiplied by length.For the second part, the area is 1000 square meters. So, I can write the equation:[ (a + 10) times L = 1000 ]Similarly, for the third part, the area is 650 square meters:[ (a - 4) times L = 650 ]Now, I have two equations:1. ( (a + 10)L = 1000 )2. ( (a - 4)L = 650 )I can solve these equations to find 'a' and 'L'. Since both equations equal the area, I can set them equal to each other in terms of 'L'.From the first equation, I can solve for 'L':[ L = frac{1000}{a + 10} ]From the second equation:[ L = frac{650}{a - 4} ]Since both expressions equal 'L', I can set them equal to each other:[ frac{1000}{a + 10} = frac{650}{a - 4} ]Now, I'll cross-multiply to solve for 'a':[ 1000(a - 4) = 650(a + 10) ]Expanding both sides:[ 1000a - 4000 = 650a + 6500 ]Now, I'll move all terms involving 'a' to one side and constants to the other:[ 1000a - 650a = 6500 + 4000 ][ 350a = 10500 ]Dividing both sides by 350:[ a = frac{10500}{350} ][ a = 30 ]So, the width of the first part is 30 meters. Now, I can find 'L' using one of the earlier equations. Let's use the first one:[ L = frac{1000}{a + 10} ][ L = frac{1000}{30 + 10} ][ L = frac{1000}{40} ][ L = 25 ]So, the length is 25 meters.

Specifically, ( x ) cannot be 6 or -4 because those values would make the denominators ( x - 6 ) and ( x + 4 ) zero, respectively.Next, I look at the numerator of the left side, ( x^2 - 3x - 18 ), and try to factor it. Factoring quadratics is a useful skill here. I find that ( x^2 - 3x - 18 ) factors into ( (x - 6)(x + 3) ). This allows me to simplify the left side of the equation by canceling the ( x - 6 ) terms, provided ( x neq 6 ).After simplifying, the equation becomes ( x + 3 = frac{2}{x + 4} ). To eliminate the fraction, I multiply both sides by ( x + 4 ), assuming ( x neq -4 ). This gives me a quadratic equation: ( x^2 + 7x + 10 = 0 ).I then factor the quadratic equation, looking for two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to 7.

I need to prove that the least of the numbers (left(a_{i} - a_{j}right)^{2}), where ( i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) and ( i neq j ), does not exceed ( frac{1}{10} ).Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step. First, I know that these five numbers are real, and their squares add up to 1. So they lie on the surface of a 5-dimensional sphere with radius 1. But I'm not sure if that geometric interpretation will help here.The problem is asking about the differences between these numbers. Specifically, the smallest squared difference between any two distinct numbers. I need to show that this smallest squared difference is at most ( frac{1}{10} ).Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use some inequalities or properties of real numbers. Since we're dealing with squares and sums, perhaps the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar could be useful.Wait, another thought: if I consider the differences ( a_i - a_j ), maybe I can relate them to the sum of squares of the numbers. There's an identity that relates the sum of squares of differences to the sum of squares of the numbers themselves.Let me recall that identity. I think it goes something like:[sum_{i < j} (a_i - a_j)^2 = n sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 - left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i right)^2]Where ( n ) is the number of terms. In this case, ( n = 5 ). So plugging in, we get:[sum_{i < j} (a_i - a_j)^2 = 5 sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i^2 - left( sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i right)^2]Given that ( sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i^2 = 1 ), this simplifies to:[sum_{i < j} (a_i - a_j)^2 = 5 times 1 - left( sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i right)^2 = 5 - left( sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i right)^2]Since ( left( sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i right)^2 ) is always non-negative, the sum of the squared differences is at most 5. So:[sum_{i < j} (a_i - a_j)^2 leq 5]Okay, so the total sum of all squared differences is at most 5. Now, there are ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) such differences. So if I denote the smallest squared difference as ( m^2 ), then each of these 10 terms is at least ( m^2 ).Therefore, the sum of all squared differences is at least ( 10 m^2 ). Putting this together with the earlier inequality:[10 m^2 leq 5]Solving for ( m^2 ):[m^2 leq frac{5}{10} = frac{1}{2}]Wait, that's not the ( frac{1}{10} ) that the problem is asking for. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me check my steps. I used the identity correctly, and the logic seems sound. Hmm. Maybe I need to refine my approach. Perhaps the assumption that all differences are at least ( m ) is too crude, and I need a better way to bound the differences.Alternatively, maybe I should consider ordering the numbers. Let's assume without loss of generality that ( a_1 leq a_2 leq a_3 leq a_4 leq a_5 ). Then, the differences between consecutive terms are ( a_2 - a_1 ), ( a_3 - a_2 ), ( a_4 - a_3 ), and ( a_5 - a_4 ). Let's denote the smallest of these differences as ( d ). So, each of these consecutive differences is at least ( d ).Now, the differences between non-consecutive terms can be expressed in terms of these consecutive differences. For example, ( a_3 - a_1 = (a_3 - a_2) + (a_2 - a_1) geq 2d ), and so on. In general, the difference between ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) where ( i > j ) is at least ( (i - j)d ).Therefore, the squared differences will be at least ( (i - j)^2 d^2 ). Now, let's compute the sum of all squared differences:[sum_{1 leq j < i leq 5} (a_i - a_j)^2 geq sum_{1 leq j < i leq 5} (i - j)^2 d^2]Let me compute this sum:- For ( i - j = 1 ): There are 4 such pairs (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5). Each contributes ( 1^2 d^2 ).- For ( i - j = 2 ): There are 3 such pairs (1-3, 2-4, 3-5). Each contributes ( 2^2 d^2 ).- For ( i - j = 3 ): There are 2 such pairs (1-4, 2-5). Each contributes ( 3^2 d^2 ).- For ( i - j = 4 ): There is 1 such pair (1-5). It contributes ( 4^2 d^2 ).So, the total sum is:[4 times 1^2 d^2 + 3 times 2^2 d^2 + 2 times 3^2 d^2 + 1 times 4^2 d^2 = 4d^2 + 12d^2 + 18d^2 + 16d^2 = 50d^2]Therefore, we have:[sum_{1 leq j < i leq 5} (a_i - a_j)^2 geq 50d^2]But earlier, we established that this sum is at most 5. So:[50d^2 leq 5 implies d^2 leq frac{5}{50} = frac{1}{10}]Therefore, the smallest squared difference ( d^2 ) is at most ( frac{1}{10} ). So, the least of the numbers ( left(a_i - a_jright)^2 ) does not exceed ( frac{1}{10} ).Wait, that's exactly what the problem asked for! So, I think this approach works. By ordering the numbers and considering the minimal differences between consecutive terms, I was able to bound the sum of squared differences and derive the required inequality.I should probably write this up more formally to ensure all steps are clear and correct. But the key idea is using the identity for the sum of squared differences, ordering the numbers to consider minimal consecutive differences, and then computing the total sum of squared differences in terms of these minimal differences. This allows us to bound the minimal squared difference by relating it to the total sum, which is constrained by the given condition on the sum of squares of the original numbers.Yeah, I think that makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning, so I'm confident this is the correct approach."},{"question":"Evaluate lfloorsqrt{45}rfloor^2 + 2lfloorsqrt{45}rfloor + 1.","answer":"First, I need to determine the value of (lfloorsqrt{45}rfloor).

Lila does the same with the first 200 positive integers; however, she first rounds every integer to its nearest multiple of 25 (rounding 12.5s up) before adding them. What is the positive difference between Jo's sum and Lila's sum?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the sum of all positive integers from 1 to 200, which Jo is doing. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: ( S = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ). Plugging in 200 for n, the sum is ( frac{200 times 201}{2} = 20100 ).Next, I need to determine Lila's sum. Lila rounds each integer from 1 to 200 to the nearest multiple of 25 before adding them. To do this, I'll consider intervals around each multiple of 25. For example, numbers from 1 to 12 are rounded to 0, numbers from 13 to 37 are rounded to 25, and so on. Each interval spans 25 numbers, with the midpoint at 12.5 determining the rounding direction.For each interval, I'll calculate the sum of the rounded numbers. For instance, from 13 to 36, there are 24 numbers, each rounded to 25, contributing ( 25 times 24 = 600 ) to the sum. Similarly, from 37 to 62, there are 25 numbers, each rounded to 50, contributing ( 50 times 25 = 1250 ), and so on for each subsequent interval up to 200.After calculating the contributions from each interval, I'll sum them all to get Lila's total. Finally, I'll find the positive difference between Jo's sum and Lila's sum by subtracting the two totals."},{"question":"After a meeting, Alice and Bob start jogging in opposite directions.

By dividing the total jogging time by her jogging rate, I can find out how many miles she has covered. Similarly, Bob jogs 3 miles every 40 minutes. I'll use the same method to determine the distance Bob has jogged.Finally, since Alice and Bob are jogging in opposite directions, the total distance between them will be the sum of the distances each has individually covered. Adding Alice's distance and Bob's distance will give me the final answer."},{"question":"Which of the following calculations is correct?A: -2+8=10B: -1-3=-4C: -2times 2=4D: -8div left(-1right)=-frac{1}{8}","answer":"Alright, so I've got this math problem here with four options, labeled A through D. Each option presents a different calculation, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me take it step by step.Starting with **Option A**: It says -2 + 8 = 10. Hmm, okay, so I'm adding a negative number and a positive number. I remember that when you add a negative and a positive, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the larger number. So, -2 + 8 should be 6, right? Because 8 - 2 = 6, and since 8 is positive, the result is positive. But the option says it's 10, which is way off. So, A is definitely incorrect.Moving on to **Option B**: It states -1 - 3 = -4. Alright, subtracting two negative numbers here. Wait, no, actually, it's subtracting a positive number from a negative number. So, -1 - 3 is like starting at -1 on the number line and moving 3 units to the left. That would land me at -4. So, that seems correct. But let me double-check. If I have -1 and I take away 3, it's like having a debt of 1 and then incurring an additional debt of 3, totaling a debt of 4. Yep, that makes sense. So, B looks good so far.Next is **Option C**: -2 times 2 = 4. Multiplying a negative by a positive. I recall that a negative times a positive gives a negative result. So, -2 times 2 should be -4, not 4. The option claims it's 4, which is wrong. So, C is incorrect.Finally, **Option D**: -8 div (-1) = -frac{1}{8}. Dividing two negative numbers. I think when you divide two negatives, the result should be positive. So, -8 divided by -1 should be 8, not -frac{1}{8}. The option has it negative and also as a fraction, which doesn't make sense because dividing by -1 just flips the sign. So, D is definitely wrong.To summarize:- A: Incorrect, should be 6.- B: Correct, it is -4.- C: Incorrect, should be -4.- D: Incorrect, should be 8.So, the only correct calculation is in **Option B**."},{"question":"if 63 percent of a class answered the first question on a certain test correctly , 50 percent answered the second question on the test correctly , and 20 percent answered neither of the questions correctly , what percent answered both correctly ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the percentage of students who answered both questions correctly.

So, I calculate the number of promotional messages:[text{Promotional messages} = frac{2}{5} times 300 = 120 text{ emails}]Finally, to find the number of important emails, I subtract the number of spam and promotional emails from the total number of emails:[text{Important emails} = 400 - 100 - 120 = 180 text{ emails}]"},{"question":"Let ( p ) be a prime number. Find all integers ( k ) such that ( p ) divides ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Let ( p ) be a prime number. I need to find all integers ( k ) such that ( p ) divides the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ). Hmm, interesting. I remember something about Fermat's Little Theorem, which might be useful here. Let me think step by step.First, I know that for a prime ( p ), the multiplicative group modulo ( p ) is cyclic of order ( p-1 ). That means there exists a generator ( g ) such that every non-zero element modulo ( p ) can be written as some power of ( g ). Maybe I can use this generator to rewrite the sum.So, if ( g ) is a generator, then the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ) modulo ( p ) can be expressed as ( g^0, g^1, g^2, ldots, g^{p-2} ). Therefore, the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ) modulo ( p ) can be rewritten as ( g^{0k} + g^{1k} + g^{2k} + ldots + g^{(p-2)k} ).This looks like a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series ( 1 + r + r^2 + ldots + r^{n-1} ) is ( frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ) when ( r neq 1 ). Applying this formula, the sum becomes ( frac{g^{(p-1)k} - 1}{g^k - 1} ) modulo ( p ).Now, by Fermat's Little Theorem, ( g^{p-1} equiv 1 mod p ). So, ( g^{(p-1)k} = (g^{p-1})^k equiv 1^k = 1 mod p ). Therefore, the numerator becomes ( 1 - 1 = 0 ). So, the entire expression becomes ( frac{0}{g^k - 1} mod p ).Wait, division by zero is undefined, so I need to be careful here. If ( g^k equiv 1 mod p ), then the denominator is zero, and the expression is undefined. But if ( g^k notequiv 1 mod p ), then the denominator is non-zero, and the expression is zero modulo ( p ).So, when does ( g^k equiv 1 mod p )? Since ( g ) is a generator, its order is ( p-1 ). Therefore, ( g^k equiv 1 mod p ) if and only if ( p-1 ) divides ( k ). That is, ( k ) is a multiple of ( p-1 ).Putting it all together, if ( p-1 ) divides ( k ), then ( g^k equiv 1 mod p ), and the sum becomes ( frac{0}{0} ), which is undefined. But in reality, each term ( i^k ) would be ( 1 ) since ( i^{p-1} equiv 1 mod p ) for each ( i ). Therefore, the sum would be ( (p-1) times 1 = p-1 equiv -1 mod p ). So, in this case, the sum is congruent to ( -1 mod p ), which is not zero.On the other hand, if ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ), then ( g^k notequiv 1 mod p ), and the sum is ( 0 mod p ). Therefore, the sum is divisible by ( p ) if and only if ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ).Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me check with a small prime, say ( p = 3 ). Then ( p-1 = 2 ). Let's compute the sum for ( k = 1 ): ( 1 + 2 = 3 ), which is divisible by 3. For ( k = 2 ): ( 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 ), which is not divisible by 3. For ( k = 3 ): ( 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9 ), which is divisible by 3. Hmm, so when ( k ) is not a multiple of ( p-1 ), the sum is divisible by ( p ), and when it is a multiple, it's not. That seems to align with my earlier conclusion.Another example: ( p = 5 ), ( p-1 = 4 ). For ( k = 1 ): ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 ), which is divisible by 5. For ( k = 2 ): ( 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30 ), which is divisible by 5. For ( k = 3 ): ( 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100 ), which is divisible by 5. For ( k = 4 ): ( 1 + 16 + 81 + 256 = 354 ), which is not divisible by 5 (since 354 ÷ 5 = 70.8). So, again, when ( k ) is a multiple of ( p-1 ), the sum isn't divisible by ( p ), and otherwise, it is.Therefore, it seems that the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ) is divisible by ( p ) for all integers ( k ) except when ( k ) is a multiple of ( p-1 ). But wait, in the problem statement, it says \\"Find all integers ( k ) such that ( p ) divides the sum.\\" So, the answer would be all integers ( k ) except those divisible by ( p-1 ).But hold on, in my first example with ( p = 3 ), when ( k = 2 ), which is a multiple of ( p-1 = 2 ), the sum was 5, which is not divisible by 3. Similarly, for ( p = 5 ), when ( k = 4 ), the sum wasn't divisible by 5. So, indeed, the sum is divisible by ( p ) if and only if ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ).Wait, but in the initial problem, it's asking for integers ( k ) such that ( p ) divides the sum. So, the answer is all integers ( k ) except those divisible by ( p-1 ). But in the thought process above, I concluded that when ( p-1 ) divides ( k ), the sum is ( -1 mod p ), which is not zero, hence not divisible by ( p ). And when ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ), the sum is zero modulo ( p ), hence divisible by ( p ).Therefore, the integers ( k ) are all integers not divisible by ( p-1 ). But the problem says \\"Find all integers ( k )\\", so I need to express this in terms of congruence or divisibility.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the concept of primitive roots. Since ( g ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ), the sum can be expressed as a geometric series, and as such, the sum is zero unless the common ratio is 1, which happens when ( g^k equiv 1 mod p ), i.e., when ( k ) is a multiple of ( p-1 ).So, to summarize, the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ) is divisible by ( p ) if and only if ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ). Therefore, the integers ( k ) are all integers not divisible by ( p-1 ).But wait, the problem says \\"Find all integers ( k )\\", so I need to express this as ( k ) such that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ). Alternatively, ( k ) not congruent to 0 modulo ( p-1 ).However, I should also consider negative integers. Since ( k ) can be any integer, positive or negative, the condition is that ( k ) is not a multiple of ( p-1 ). So, in terms of congruence, ( k notequiv 0 mod (p-1) ).But let me check with another example to be sure. Let ( p = 7 ), so ( p-1 = 6 ). Let's take ( k = 1 ): sum is ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 ), which is divisible by 7. For ( k = 2 ): ( 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91 ), which is divisible by 7 (91 ÷ 7 = 13). For ( k = 3 ): ( 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 + 125 + 216 = 441 ), which is divisible by 7 (441 ÷ 7 = 63). For ( k = 4 ): ( 1 + 16 + 81 + 256 + 625 + 1296 = 2275 ), which is divisible by 7 (2275 ÷ 7 = 325). For ( k = 5 ): ( 1 + 32 + 243 + 1024 + 3125 + 7776 = 12201 ), which is divisible by 7 (12201 ÷ 7 = 1743). For ( k = 6 ): ( 1 + 64 + 729 + 4096 + 15625 + 46656 = 67161 ), which is not divisible by 7 (67161 ÷ 7 = 9594.428...). So, again, when ( k ) is a multiple of ( p-1 = 6 ), the sum isn't divisible by ( p = 7 ), and otherwise, it is.Therefore, my conclusion seems consistent across different primes and values of ( k ). So, the integers ( k ) are all integers not divisible by ( p-1 ).But wait, the problem says \\"Find all integers ( k )\\", so I need to express this as ( k ) such that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ). Alternatively, ( k ) not congruent to 0 modulo ( p-1 ).However, I should also consider negative integers. Since ( k ) can be any integer, positive or negative, the condition is that ( k ) is not a multiple of ( p-1 ). So, in terms of congruence, ( k notequiv 0 mod (p-1) ).But to make sure, let me think about ( k ) being negative. For example, ( k = -1 ). Then, ( 1^{-1} + 2^{-1} + ldots + (p-1)^{-1} mod p ). But inverses modulo ( p ) are well-defined since ( p ) is prime. However, the sum of inverses modulo ( p ) is also a known result. Wait, actually, the sum of inverses modulo ( p ) is congruent to the sum of the numbers themselves because each element is its own inverse or paired with another. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Let me think.Actually, for each ( i ), ( i^{-1} ) is some element in ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ). So, the sum ( 1^{-1} + 2^{-1} + ldots + (p-1)^{-1} ) is just a permutation of the sum ( 1 + 2 + ldots + (p-1) ). Therefore, the sum is the same as ( 1 + 2 + ldots + (p-1) ), which is ( frac{p(p-1)}{2} ). Therefore, modulo ( p ), this sum is ( frac{p(p-1)}{2} equiv 0 mod p ) because ( p ) divides ( p(p-1)/2 ). So, for ( k = -1 ), the sum is divisible by ( p ).But ( k = -1 ) is not a multiple of ( p-1 ), unless ( p-1 = 1 ), which only happens when ( p = 2 ). For ( p = 2 ), ( p-1 = 1 ), so ( k = -1 ) is a multiple of 1, but in that case, the sum is just ( 1^{-1} = 1 mod 2 ), which is 1, not divisible by 2. Wait, that seems contradictory.Wait, for ( p = 2 ), the sum is just ( 1^k ). So, ( 1^k = 1 ), which is 1 modulo 2, not divisible by 2. So, for ( p = 2 ), the sum is never divisible by 2, regardless of ( k ). But according to our earlier conclusion, since ( p-1 = 1 ), ( k ) not divisible by 1 would mean no such ( k ), which is not the case because all integers are divisible by 1. So, for ( p = 2 ), the sum is never divisible by 2, which aligns with the fact that ( p-1 = 1 ), and all ( k ) are multiples of 1, hence the sum is never divisible by ( p ).So, in general, for primes ( p geq 3 ), the sum is divisible by ( p ) if and only if ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ). For ( p = 2 ), the sum is never divisible by 2.But the problem statement says \\"Let ( p ) be a prime number.\\" It doesn't specify ( p geq 3 ), so we have to consider ( p = 2 ) as well. For ( p = 2 ), the sum is ( 1^k ), which is 1, not divisible by 2. So, for ( p = 2 ), there are no integers ( k ) such that ( p ) divides the sum. For ( p geq 3 ), the integers ( k ) are all integers not divisible by ( p-1 ).But the problem asks for \\"all integers ( k )\\", so perhaps we need to express the answer in terms of ( k ) not being multiples of ( p-1 ). Alternatively, using modular arithmetic, ( k notequiv 0 mod (p-1) ).But let me think again about negative ( k ). For example, take ( p = 5 ), ( k = -1 ). The sum is ( 1^{-1} + 2^{-1} + 3^{-1} + 4^{-1} mod 5 ). The inverses modulo 5 are:- ( 1^{-1} = 1 )- ( 2^{-1} = 3 ) because ( 2 times 3 = 6 equiv 1 mod 5 )- ( 3^{-1} = 2 ) because ( 3 times 2 = 6 equiv 1 mod 5 )- ( 4^{-1} = 4 ) because ( 4 times 4 = 16 equiv 1 mod 5 )So, the sum is ( 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10 equiv 0 mod 5 ). Therefore, for ( k = -1 ), the sum is divisible by ( p = 5 ). Since ( -1 ) is not a multiple of ( p-1 = 4 ), this aligns with our earlier conclusion.Similarly, for ( k = -2 ), which is equivalent to ( k = 2 mod 4 ), the sum would be the same as ( k = 2 ), which is divisible by 5. So, negative ( k ) values also follow the same rule as positive ones.Therefore, the answer is that ( p ) divides the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ) if and only if ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ). In other words, all integers ( k ) such that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ).But to express this in a box as per the instruction, I need to write the final answer. Since the problem asks for all integers ( k ), and the condition is that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ), I can write this as ( k notequiv 0 mod (p-1) ). Alternatively, in terms of divisibility, ( (p-1) nmid k ).However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of congruence or a specific form. Since the original problem didn't specify whether ( k ) is positive or negative, and considering that ( k ) can be any integer, the answer is all integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).So, to wrap it up, the integers ( k ) are all integers except those divisible by ( p-1 ). Therefore, the final answer is:All integers ( k ) such that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ).But in the required format, I need to put it inside a box. Since the answer is a condition on ( k ), I can express it as:All integers ( k ) with ( k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1} ).Alternatively, using the notation for divisibility, ( (p-1) nmid k ).But to make it concise and fit in a box, I think the most standard way is to write the condition as ( k notequiv 0 mod (p-1) ).So, the final answer is:All integers ( k ) such that ( k ) is not congruent to 0 modulo ( p-1 ).But since the problem asks for \\"all integers ( k )\\", and not a specific form, perhaps the answer is simply that ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ). Therefore, in the box, I can write:All integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).But to make it precise, in mathematical terms, it's ( k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1} ).So, I think the most appropriate way is:All integers ( k ) with ( k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1} ).But since the problem might expect a specific format, perhaps stating it as ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).Alternatively, if I recall correctly, in some number theory contexts, the sum ( 1^k + 2^k + ldots + (p-1)^k ) is congruent to 0 modulo ( p ) if and only if ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ). Therefore, the answer is all integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).So, to conclude, the integers ( k ) are all integers not divisible by ( p-1 ). Therefore, the final answer is:All integers ( k ) such that ( p-1 ) does not divide ( k ).But to put it in a box as per the instruction, I think the most concise way is:All integers ( k ) with ( k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1} ).But since the problem is in English, perhaps stating it as \\"all integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 )\\" is clearer.Alternatively, using the notation ( (p-1) nmid k ).But to make it fit in a box, I think the most standard way is:All integers ( k ) such that ( k ) is not divisible by ( p-1 ).But since the problem is about divisibility, perhaps the answer is simply:All integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).Therefore, the final answer is:All integers ( k ) not divisible by ( p-1 ).But to express this in a mathematical box, I can write:boxed{k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1}}Alternatively, if the problem expects a different format, but I think this is the most precise.Wait, but in the initial problem, it's asking for \\"all integers ( k )\\", so perhaps the answer is all integers ( k ) except multiples of ( p-1 ). Therefore, in the box, I can write:boxed{k notequiv 0 pmod{p-1}}Yes, that seems appropriate."},{"question":"In solving the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}{x+y=5}{x-y=2}end{array}right. using addition and subtraction, we eliminate x using _____ method and eliminate y using _____ method.（  ）A: addition, additionB: addition, subtractionC: subtraction, additionD: multiplication, subtraction","answer":"To solve the system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}x + y = 5 x - y = 2end{array}right.]**Step 1: Eliminate ( y ) using addition**Add the two equations to eliminate ( y ):[begin{align*}(x + y) + (x - y) &= 5 + 2 2x &= 7 x &= frac{7}{2}end{align*}]**Step 2: Eliminate ( x ) using subtraction**Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate ( x ):[begin{align*}(x + y) - (x - y) &= 5 - 2 2y &= 3 y &= frac{3}{2}end{align*}]**Conclusion:**To eliminate ( x ), we used the subtraction method, and to eliminate ( y ), we used the addition method.

So, m, the number of parabolas, is n(n - 1)/2.Each parabola can be written in the form f_i(x) = (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are two of the given points. So, for example, one parabola might be (x - X₁)(x - X₂), another could be (x - X₁)(x - X₃), and so on, until all pairs are exhausted.Now, the problem asks us to consider the sum of all these parabolas: y = f₁(x) + f₂(x) + ... + fₘ(x). We need to show that this sum is a parabola that intersects the Ox axis at exactly two points. So, essentially, we need to show that when we add up all these quadratics, the resulting quadratic has exactly two real roots.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express the sum in terms of the roots and then analyze its discriminant. Since each f_i(x) is a quadratic, their sum will also be a quadratic. Let me denote the sum as S(x) = A x² + B x + C. Then, to find the roots, we can compute the discriminant D = B² - 4AC. If D is positive, there are two distinct real roots; if D is zero, one real root; and if D is negative, no real roots.So, my goal is to compute A, B, and C for the sum S(x) and then compute the discriminant D to show that it's positive, which would imply two distinct real roots.Let me try to compute A, B, and C. Each f_i(x) is (x - a)(x - b) = x² - (a + b)x + ab. So, when we sum all f_i(x), we can separate the sum into three parts: the sum of x² terms, the sum of x terms, and the sum of constant terms.First, the coefficient A is the sum of the coefficients of x² in each f_i(x). Since each f_i(x) has a coefficient of 1 for x², and there are m = n(n - 1)/2 such terms, A = m = n(n - 1)/2.Next, the coefficient B is the sum of the coefficients of x in each f_i(x). Each f_i(x) has a coefficient of -(a + b) for x, where a and b are the roots. So, B is the negative sum over all pairs (a + b). Let me denote S = X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ. Then, the sum over all pairs (a + b) is equal to (n - 1)S. Because each X_i appears in (n - 1) pairs: paired with each of the other n - 1 points. So, the total sum is (n - 1)S, and since B is the negative of that, B = -(n - 1)S.Now, the constant term C is the sum of the constants from each f_i(x). Each f_i(x) has a constant term of ab, where a and b are the roots. So, C is the sum over all pairs ab. Let me denote P = X₁X₂ + X₁X₃ + ... + X_{n-1}X_n. So, C = P.Putting it all together, the sum S(x) is:S(x) = [n(n - 1)/2] x² - (n - 1)S x + PNow, let's compute the discriminant D:D = B² - 4AC = [-(n - 1)S]^2 - 4 * [n(n - 1)/2] * PSimplify this:D = (n - 1)² S² - 2n(n - 1) PFactor out (n - 1):D = (n - 1)[(n - 1)S² - 2n P]Now, I need to analyze this expression. Let's see if I can relate S² and P in some way. Remember that S is the sum of all X_i, and P is the sum of all products of two distinct X_i.I recall that (X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ)² = X₁² + X₂² + ... + Xₙ² + 2(X₁X₂ + X₁X₃ + ... + X_{n-1}X_n). So, S² = sum X_i² + 2P.Therefore, sum X_i² = S² - 2P.Let me substitute this into the discriminant expression:D = (n - 1)[(n - 1)S² - 2n P]But from the identity above, S² = sum X_i² + 2P, so sum X_i² = S² - 2P.Wait, maybe I can express P in terms of S² and sum X_i².Alternatively, perhaps I can express the discriminant in terms of the sum of squares of the differences between the roots.Let me think about variance. The sum of squares can be related to the variance.Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that:sum_{i < j} (X_i - X_j)^2 = (n - 1) sum X_i² - 2 sum_{i < j} X_i X_jWhich is equal to (n - 1) sum X_i² - 2P.But from the identity S² = sum X_i² + 2P, we can write sum X_i² = S² - 2P.Substituting into the expression above:sum_{i < j} (X_i - X_j)^2 = (n - 1)(S² - 2P) - 2P = (n - 1)S² - 2(n - 1)P - 2P = (n - 1)S² - 2nPWait, that's exactly the expression inside the discriminant D:D = (n - 1)[(n - 1)S² - 2n P] = (n - 1) * sum_{i < j} (X_i - X_j)^2But sum_{i < j} (X_i - X_j)^2 is the sum of the squares of all pairwise differences. Since all X_i are distinct (they are various points), each (X_i - X_j)^2 is positive. Therefore, the sum is positive, and since n - 1 is positive (n ≥ 3), D is positive.Therefore, the discriminant D is positive, which means that the quadratic equation S(x) = 0 has two distinct real roots. Hence, the parabola y = S(x) intersects the Ox axis at exactly two points.So, after this detailed computation, I conclude that the sum of all these parabolas indeed intersects the Ox axis at two points.**Final Answer**The parabola ( y = f_1(x) + f_2(x) + ldots + f_m(x) ) intersects the ( Ox ) axis at exactly two points, so the final answer is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Given two fixed points ( A ) and ( B ) in the plane, the set of all points ( P ) such that the sum of the (undirected) distances from ( P ) to ( A ) and ( B ) is twice the distance between ( A ) and ( B ), forms which geometric shape?A) The line segment from ( A ) to ( B )B) The line passing through ( A ) and ( B )C) The perpendicular bisector of the line segment from ( A ) to ( B )D) An ellipse having positive areaE) A parabola","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it properly. It says: Given two fixed points A and B in the plane, the set of all points P such that the sum of the (undirected) distances from P to A and B is twice the distance between A and B, forms which geometric shape? The options are A) The line segment from A to B, B) The line passing through A and B, C) The perpendicular bisector of the line segment from A to B, D) An ellipse having positive area, and E) A parabola.Alright, so I need to figure out what shape is formed by all points P where the sum of the distances from P to A and P to B is equal to twice the distance between A and B. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.First, let's denote the distance between points A and B as d. So, the distance from A to B is d. The condition given is that for any point P, PA + PB = 2d. So, the sum of the distances from P to A and P to B is twice the distance between A and B.I remember that in geometry, there's a concept called an ellipse, which is defined as the set of all points where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (called foci) is constant. So, if I recall correctly, an ellipse has two foci, and any point on the ellipse has the sum of its distances to these two foci equal to a constant, which is greater than the distance between the foci.In this problem, the two fixed points are A and B, so they would be the foci of the ellipse. The constant sum of distances is 2d, which is twice the distance between A and B. Now, in an ellipse, the constant sum is greater than the distance between the foci. Here, 2d is indeed greater than d, so that fits the definition of an ellipse.But wait, let me make sure. Is there any other shape that could satisfy this condition? Let's think about the options given.Option A is the line segment from A to B. If I consider points on the line segment between A and B, then for any point P on this segment, the sum of the distances PA + PB would be equal to AB, which is d. But in our problem, the sum is 2d, which is twice as much. So, that doesn't fit. Therefore, option A is not correct.Option B is the line passing through A and B. So, that's the entire line, not just the segment. If I take a point P on the line beyond A or beyond B, then PA + PB would be greater than AB. Let's see, if P is on the line extended beyond A, then PA would be negative if we consider directed distances, but since the problem specifies undirected distances, PA would just be the absolute distance. So, PA + PB would be equal to AB + 2AP if P is beyond A, or AB + 2BP if P is beyond B. In either case, the sum would be greater than AB. However, in our problem, the sum is exactly 2d, which is twice AB. So, if P is exactly at a point such that PA + PB = 2d, where would that be?Wait, if P is on the line AB extended beyond A, then PA + PB would be equal to AB + 2AP. If we set that equal to 2d, then AB + 2AP = 2d. Since AB is d, that would mean 2AP = d, so AP = d/2. So, P would be a point beyond A at a distance of d/2 from A. Similarly, if P is beyond B, it would be a point beyond B at a distance of d/2 from B. So, there are only two such points on the line AB where PA + PB = 2d. Therefore, the set of all such points P is not the entire line, but just two points. So, option B is not correct.Option C is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from A to B. The perpendicular bisector is the set of all points equidistant from A and B. So, for any point P on the perpendicular bisector, PA = PB. If we set PA + PB = 2d, then since PA = PB, we have 2PA = 2d, so PA = d. Therefore, the set of points P on the perpendicular bisector where PA = d would be two points: one on one side of AB and one on the other side, each at a distance d from A and B. So, again, only two points, not the entire perpendicular bisector. Therefore, option C is not correct.Option D is an ellipse having positive area. As I thought earlier, an ellipse is defined as the set of points where the sum of the distances to two foci is constant. In this case, the foci are A and B, and the constant sum is 2d, which is greater than the distance between A and B (which is d). Therefore, this should form an ellipse. Moreover, since the constant sum is greater than the distance between the foci, the ellipse has positive area, meaning it's a full ellipse, not just a line segment or a single point. So, option D seems correct.Option E is a parabola. A parabola is defined as the set of points where the distance to a fixed point (focus) is equal to the distance to a fixed line (directrix). This is different from the condition given here, which involves the sum of distances to two points. Therefore, option E is not correct.So, after considering all the options, it seems that the correct answer is D) An ellipse having positive area.But just to make sure, let me visualize this. If I have two points A and B, and I want to find all points P such that PA + PB = 2d, where d is the distance between A and B. If I imagine moving point P around, the sum of the distances PA + PB would vary. When P is on the line segment AB, the sum is exactly d, which is less than 2d. When P is somewhere else, not on the line AB, the sum can be larger. In fact, the maximum sum occurs when P is at infinity in some direction, but in our case, we're looking for points where the sum is exactly 2d.So, if I think about the definition of an ellipse, it's like stretching a string between two points (A and B) and keeping the total length of the string constant (2d). As I move the pencil around, keeping the string taut, it traces out an ellipse. The major axis of the ellipse would be along the line AB, and the minor axis would be perpendicular to AB. The distance between A and B is d, so the major axis length is 2d, which makes sense because the sum of the distances is 2d.Wait, actually, in an ellipse, the sum of the distances is 2a, where 2a is the length of the major axis. The distance between the foci is 2c, where c is the distance from the center to each focus. So, in our case, 2a = 2d, so a = d. The distance between the foci is 2c = d, so c = d/2. Then, the relationship between a, b (the semi-minor axis), and c in an ellipse is a² = b² + c². So, plugging in, d² = b² + (d/2)². Therefore, b² = d² - (d²/4) = (3d²)/4, so b = (√3 d)/2. Therefore, the ellipse has a major axis of length 2d, a minor axis of length √3 d, and it's centered at the midpoint of AB.So, yes, this makes sense. The set of points P forms an ellipse with foci at A and B, major axis length 2d, and minor axis length √3 d. Therefore, it's a valid ellipse with positive area.Just to double-check, if I consider specific points on this ellipse. For example, when P is at the midpoint of AB, the sum of the distances PA + PB would be equal to AB, which is d, but in our case, we need the sum to be 2d. So, the midpoint is not on the ellipse. Instead, the ellipse extends beyond the line segment AB. The points where P is on the line AB extended beyond A and B at a distance of d/2 from A and B, respectively, would lie on the ellipse because PA + PB would be d + d = 2d.Also, if I take a point P perpendicular to AB at a certain distance, the sum PA + PB would still be 2d. For example, if I move P upwards from the midpoint of AB, the distances PA and PB would increase, but their sum would still be 2d. This is consistent with the properties of an ellipse.Therefore, after all this thinking and verifying, I'm confident that the correct answer is D) An ellipse having positive area."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow {a}=(1,k) and overrightarrow {b}=(9,k-6), find the value of k if overrightarrow {a} is parallel to overrightarrow {b}.","answer":"To determine the value of ( k ) for which vectors ( overrightarrow{a} = (1, k) ) and ( overrightarrow{b} = (9, k - 6) ) are parallel, we can use the property that parallel vectors are scalar multiples of each other.1. **Set Up the Proportion:**   Since ( overrightarrow{a} ) is parallel to ( overrightarrow{b} ), there exists a scalar ( lambda ) such that:   [   overrightarrow{b} = lambda overrightarrow{a}   ]   This gives the system of equations:   [   9 = lambda times 1 quad text{and} quad k - 6 = lambda times k   ]2. **Solve for ( lambda ):**   From the first equation:   [   lambda = 9   ]3. **Substitute ( lambda ) into the Second Equation:**   [   k - 6 = 9k   ]4. **Solve for ( k ):**   [   -6 = 8k quad Rightarrow quad k = -frac{6}{8} = -frac{3}{4}   ]Therefore, the value of ( k ) is ( -frac{3}{4} )."},{"question":"There are some fishbowls. Each fishbowl has 23 fish. There are 6003 fish. How many fishbowls are there?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: There are some fishbowls, each containing 23 fish, and altogether there are 6003 fish. I need to find out how many fishbowls there are. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that each fishbowl has 23 fish. So, if I have one fishbowl, that's 23 fish. If I have two fishbowls, that's 23 times 2, which is 46 fish. So, it seems like the total number of fish depends on how many fishbowls there are. In other words, the total number of fish is equal to the number of fishbowls multiplied by 23.Now, the problem says there are 6003 fish in total. So, I need to find out how many fishbowls would give me 6003 fish when each bowl has 23 fish. That sounds like a division problem because I'm trying to find out how many times 23 fits into 6003.Let me write that down: Number of fishbowls = Total number of fish / Number of fish per bowl. So, that would be 6003 divided by 23.Alright, let's do the division. 23 goes into 6003 how many times? Maybe I can use long division for this. Let's set it up:23 ) 6003First, I look at how many times 23 goes into the first few digits of 6003. Let's see, 23 goes into 60 two times because 23 times 2 is 46, and 23 times 3 is 69, which is too big. So, I write down 2, multiply 23 by 2, which is 46, subtract that from 60, and I get 14.Now, bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 140. How many times does 23 go into 140? Let's see, 23 times 6 is 138, which is close to 140. So, I write down 6, multiply 23 by 6 to get 138, subtract that from 140, and I have a remainder of 2.Next, bring down the last digit, which is 3, making it 23. Now, how many times does 23 go into 23? Exactly once. So, I write down 1, multiply 23 by 1 to get 23, subtract that from 23, and there's no remainder left.Putting it all together, the quotient is 261. So, 23 times 261 equals 6003. That means there are 261 fishbowls.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I multiply 23 by 261, do I really get 6003? Let's see:23 times 200 is 4600.23 times 60 is 1380.23 times 1 is 23.Adding those up: 4600 + 1380 = 5980, plus 23 is 6003. Yep, that checks out.So, I'm confident that the number of fishbowls is 261."},{"question":"John has 8 green marbles and 7 purple marbles. He chooses a marble at random, records its color, and then does not put the marble back. He repeats this process 6 times. What is the probability that he chooses exactly three green marbles?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where John has 8 green marbles and 7 purple marbles. He's going to pick a marble, note its color, and not put it back. He does this six times, and I need to find the probability that exactly three of those marbles he picks are green. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First off, I know that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of marbles is 8 green plus 7 purple, which is 15 marbles in total. John is picking 6 marbles without replacement, so the total number of ways he can pick any 6 marbles out of 15 is a combination problem. I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here because we're just concerned with how many green and purple marbles he picks, not the specific order in which he picks them.So, the total number of ways to choose 6 marbles out of 15 is calculated using the combination formula, which is n choose k, or C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). Plugging in the numbers, that would be C(15, 6). Let me calculate that: 15! / (6! * (15 - 6)!) = 15! / (6! * 9!). I can simplify this by canceling out the 9! in the numerator and denominator, so it becomes (15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). Let me compute that step by step:15 * 14 = 210210 * 13 = 27302730 * 12 = 3276032760 * 11 = 360,360360,360 * 10 = 3,603,600Now the denominator: 6 * 5 = 3030 * 4 = 120120 * 3 = 360360 * 2 = 720720 * 1 = 720So, 3,603,600 divided by 720. Let me do that division:3,603,600 ÷ 720. Well, 720 goes into 3,603,600 how many times? Let's see:720 * 5000 = 3,600,000So, 3,603,600 - 3,600,000 = 3,600720 goes into 3,600 exactly 5 times because 720 * 5 = 3,600.So, total is 5000 + 5 = 5005. Okay, so C(15, 6) is 5005. That's the total number of possible ways John can pick any 6 marbles.Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking exactly 3 green marbles and 3 purple marbles. So, I need to calculate how many ways he can pick 3 green marbles out of 8 and 3 purple marbles out of 7.Starting with the green marbles: C(8, 3). Using the combination formula again, that's 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!). Simplifying, that becomes (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) because the 5! cancels out in numerator and denominator.Calculating that: 8 * 7 = 56, 56 * 6 = 336. Then, 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. So, 336 / 6 = 56. So, C(8, 3) is 56.Next, the purple marbles: C(7, 3). Again, using the combination formula: 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = 7! / (3! * 4!). Simplifying, that's (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1).Calculating that: 7 * 6 = 42, 42 * 5 = 210. Then, 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. So, 210 / 6 = 35. Therefore, C(7, 3) is 35.Now, to find the total number of favorable outcomes where John picks exactly 3 green and 3 purple marbles, I need to multiply the number of ways to choose the green marbles by the number of ways to choose the purple marbles. So, that's 56 * 35.Let me calculate that: 56 * 35. Breaking it down, 50 * 35 = 1750 and 6 * 35 = 210. Adding those together, 1750 + 210 = 1960. So, there are 1960 favorable ways.Now, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 1960 / 5005.I should simplify this fraction. Let's see if 1960 and 5005 have any common factors. Let's try dividing both by 5: 1960 ÷ 5 = 392, and 5005 ÷ 5 = 1001. So, the simplified fraction is 392/1001.Let me check if 392 and 1001 have any common factors. 392 is 49 * 8, and 1001 is 7 * 11 * 13. Hmm, 49 is 7 * 7, so 392 is 7 * 7 * 8, and 1001 is 7 * 11 * 13. So, they have a common factor of 7. Let me divide both numerator and denominator by 7: 392 ÷ 7 = 56, and 1001 ÷ 7 = 143. So, the simplified fraction is 56/143.Wait, but earlier I had 392/1001, which simplifies to 56/143. Let me double-check that division: 392 ÷ 7 is indeed 56 because 7 * 56 = 392. And 1001 ÷ 7 is 143 because 7 * 143 = 1001. So, yes, 56/143 is the simplified form.Alternatively, I can also express this probability as a decimal or percentage, but since the question doesn't specify, I think the fractional form is acceptable. So, the probability that John picks exactly three green marbles out of six is 56/143.Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying. I had 1960/5005, divided both by 5 to get 392/1001, then divided both by 7 to get 56/143. That seems correct. 56 and 143 don't have any common factors besides 1, so that's the simplest form.Alternatively, I can also think about this problem using permutations instead of combinations, but since the order doesn't matter here, combinations are the right approach. If I were to use permutations, I would have to consider the different orders in which the green and purple marbles could be picked, which would complicate things unnecessarily.Another way to approach this is using the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is used for successes and failures without replacement. The formula is:P(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)Where:- N is the total population size (15 marbles)- K is the number of success states in the population (8 green marbles)- n is the number of draws (6 marbles)- k is the number of observed successes (3 green marbles)Plugging in the numbers:P(X = 3) = [C(8, 3) * C(15 - 8, 6 - 3)] / C(15, 6)Which simplifies to:P(X = 3) = [C(8, 3) * C(7, 3)] / C(15, 6)Which is exactly what I calculated earlier: [56 * 35] / 5005 = 1960 / 5005 = 56/143.So, using the hypergeometric distribution confirms my earlier calculation. That gives me more confidence that 56/143 is the correct probability.Just to recap:1. Total marbles: 152. Total ways to pick 6 marbles: C(15, 6) = 50053. Ways to pick 3 green marbles: C(8, 3) = 564. Ways to pick 3 purple marbles: C(7, 3) = 355. Total favorable outcomes: 56 * 35 = 19606. Probability: 1960 / 5005 = 56/143Yes, that all adds up. I think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work. It's easy to make a mistake in combination calculations, especially with larger numbers, but going through it step by step and verifying each part helps ensure accuracy.I also considered whether there's another method, like using permutations, but realized that combinations are the appropriate tool here because the order of selection doesn't matter. Using permutations would have required considering all possible sequences, which is more complex and unnecessary for this problem.Additionally, I thought about the hypergeometric distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of successes in a sequence of independent draws without replacement. This distribution is exactly what applies here since we're dealing with two groups (green and purple marbles) and drawing without replacement. Applying the formula confirmed my initial calculation, which is reassuring.In summary, the key steps are:- Calculate the total number of ways to draw 6 marbles from 15.- Calculate the number of ways to draw 3 green marbles from 8.- Calculate the number of ways to draw 3 purple marbles from 7.- Multiply the last two to get the number of favorable outcomes.- Divide the favorable outcomes by the total outcomes to get the probability.- Simplify the resulting fraction.Each step was carefully computed and verified, and the use of the hypergeometric distribution formula provided an alternative confirmation of the result. This thorough approach helps minimize errors and ensures that the solution is accurate."},{"question":"Wendy purchased five different types of ribbon for a complex crafting project.

This gives the inequality:   [   x - 3 geq 0   ]   Solving for ( x ), we find:   [   x geq 3   ]2. **Denominator Condition**: The denominator ( sqrt{x - 3} ) cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we must have:   [   sqrt{x - 3} neq 0   ]   This implies:   [   x - 3 > 0   ]   Solving for ( x ), we find:   [   x > 3   ]Combining these two conditions, we conclude that ( x ) must be greater than 3.

December 21, 2012 is the Winter Solstice. Determine which day of the Nines February 3, 2013 falls on.","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out which day of the Nines February 3, 2013 falls on, given that December 21, 2012 is the Winter Solstice. The agricultural proverb \\"Counting in Nines during Winter\\" divides the days from the Winter Solstice into segments of nine days each, called One Nine, Two Nine, and so on up to Nine Nine. The first day of the Winter Solstice is considered the first day of One Nine.Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to calculate the number of days from December 21, 2012, to February 3, 2013. This will help me determine how many nine-day periods have passed and which specific day within the current period February 3 falls on.Starting with December 21, 2012, to December 31, 2012. December has 31 days, so from the 21st to the 31st, that's:31 - 21 + 1 = 11 daysSo, there are 11 days in December after and including the 21st.Next, January 2013 has 31 days. So, all 31 days of January are included in our count.Then, from February 1, 2013, to February 3, 2013, that's 3 days.Adding these up:11 (December) + 31 (January) + 3 (February) = 45 daysSo, from December 21, 2012, to February 3, 2013, there are 45 days.Now, since we're counting in nines, we need to divide this total number of days by 9 to see how many complete nine-day periods have passed and what the remainder is.45 ÷ 9 = 5So, 5 nine-day periods have passed completely, and the remainder is 0. This means that February 3, 2013, is the last day of the fifth nine-day period.Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the remainder correctly. If the remainder is 0, does that mean it's the 9th day of the 5th period? Yes, because if you think about it, the first day is day 1 of the first period, the 9th day is the end of the first period, the 10th day is the start of the second period, and so on. So, a remainder of 0 would correspond to the 9th day of the 5th period.Let me double-check this by listing out the periods:1st Nine: December 21 - December 29 (9 days)2nd Nine: December 30 - January 7 (9 days)3rd Nine: January 8 - January 16 (9 days)4th Nine: January 17 - January 25 (9 days)5th Nine: January 26 - February 3 (9 days)Yes, that adds up. Each nine-day period starts on the day after the previous period ended. So, the 5th Nine starts on January 26 and ends on February 3. Therefore, February 3 is indeed the 9th day of the 5th Nine.Just to be thorough, let's count the days:From December 21 to December 29: 9 daysFrom December 30 to January 7: 9 daysFrom January 8 to January 16: 9 daysFrom January 17 to January 25: 9 daysFrom January 26 to February 3: 9 daysAdding these up: 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 45 daysWhich matches our earlier calculation.

I need to figure out the order of these three from largest to smallest and choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's write down what each of these expressions is:- ( a = 2^{-frac{1}{3}} )- ( b = log_{2}frac{1}{3} )- ( c = log_{frac{1}{2}}frac{1}{3} )Alright, so I have an exponential expression for a, and two logarithmic expressions for b and c. I need to compare these three values.Let me start with ( a = 2^{-frac{1}{3}} ). Hmm, negative exponents mean reciprocals, right? So ( 2^{-frac{1}{3}} ) is the same as ( frac{1}{2^{frac{1}{3}}} ). And ( 2^{frac{1}{3}} ) is the cube root of 2. I remember that the cube root of 2 is approximately 1.26. So, ( frac{1}{1.26} ) is roughly 0.794. So, a is approximately 0.794. That means a is less than 1 but greater than 0.Next, let's look at ( b = log_{2}frac{1}{3} ). Log base 2 of 1/3. I know that ( log_{2}1 = 0 ) because any log base to 1 is 0. Since 1/3 is less than 1, the logarithm will be negative. To get a better sense, I can use the change of base formula: ( log_{2}frac{1}{3} = frac{ln frac{1}{3}}{ln 2} ). Calculating this, ( ln frac{1}{3} ) is ( -ln 3 ), so it becomes ( frac{-ln 3}{ln 2} ). I know that ( ln 3 ) is approximately 1.0986 and ( ln 2 ) is about 0.6931. So, ( frac{-1.0986}{0.6931} ) is roughly -1.58496. So, b is approximately -1.585. That's a negative number, so it's definitely less than a and c.Now, let's tackle ( c = log_{frac{1}{2}}frac{1}{3} ). This is a logarithm with a base less than 1, which means the function is decreasing. I remember that ( log_{frac{1}{2}}x ) is the same as ( -log_{2}x ). So, ( log_{frac{1}{2}}frac{1}{3} = -log_{2}frac{1}{3} ). But wait, we already calculated ( log_{2}frac{1}{3} ) as approximately -1.585. So, taking the negative of that gives us approximately 1.585. So, c is about 1.585.Putting it all together:- ( c approx 1.585 )- ( a approx 0.794 )- ( b approx -1.585 )So, ordering them from largest to smallest: c > a > b.Looking back at the options:A: a > b > c  B: a > c > b  C: c > a > b  D: c > b > a  So, the correct order is C: c > a > b.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For a: ( 2^{-1/3} ) is indeed the cube root of 1/2, which is approximately 0.794. That seems right.For b: ( log_{2}(1/3) ) is negative because 1/3 is less than 1. Using the change of base formula, I got approximately -1.585. That seems correct.For c: ( log_{1/2}(1/3) ). Since the base is less than 1, the log function is decreasing, so as the argument increases, the log decreases. But since the argument is 1/3, which is less than 1, the log should be positive. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.Actually, ( log_{1/2}(1/3) ) can be calculated as ( frac{ln(1/3)}{ln(1/2)} ). So, ( ln(1/3) = -ln 3 ) and ( ln(1/2) = -ln 2 ). So, the negatives cancel out, giving ( frac{ln 3}{ln 2} ), which is approximately 1.585. So, yes, c is positive and approximately 1.585.So, my initial conclusion seems correct. c is the largest, followed by a, then b. So, option C is correct.I think I got it right. Maybe I can also think about it in terms of exponents and logarithms without calculating the exact values.For a: ( 2^{-1/3} ) is between 0 and 1 because any positive number to a negative exponent is a fraction, and since the exponent is -1/3, it's the cube root of 1/2, which is less than 1.For b: ( log_{2}(1/3) ) is negative because 1/3 is less than 1, and log base 2 of numbers less than 1 is negative.For c: ( log_{1/2}(1/3) ). Since the base is less than 1, the logarithm of a number less than 1 is positive. Because as the base is between 0 and 1, the function increases as the argument decreases. So, since 1/3 is less than 1/2, the log should be greater than 1. In fact, it's the same as ( log_{2}(3) ), which is approximately 1.585, as we saw earlier.So, again, c is the largest, then a, then b. So, option C is correct.I don't think I made any mistakes in my reasoning. It all checks out.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Convert the binary number 101110_{(2)} to its equivalent octal number.","answer":"First, I need to convert the binary number (101110_{(2)}) to its decimal equivalent.

The direction vector of the line is given as ( overrightarrow{a} = (-3, 2, 1) ), and the normal vector of the plane is ( overrightarrow{n} = (1, 2, -1) ). The options are:A: ( l perp alpha )B: ( l parallel alpha )C: ( l parallel alpha ) or ( l subset alpha )D: ( l ) intersects with ( alpha ) but not perpendicularOkay, so I need to figure out whether the line is perpendicular to the plane, parallel, lying within the plane, or intersecting but not perpendicular.First, I remember that the relationship between a line and a plane can be determined by looking at the direction vector of the line and the normal vector of the plane. If the direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector, then the line is either parallel to the plane or lies within the plane. If it's not perpendicular, then the line intersects the plane at some angle.So, to check if they're perpendicular, I need to calculate the dot product of ( overrightarrow{a} ) and ( overrightarrow{n} ). If the dot product is zero, they are perpendicular; otherwise, they're not.Let me compute the dot product:( overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{n} = (-3) times 1 + 2 times 2 + 1 times (-1) )Calculating each term:- ( (-3) times 1 = -3 )- ( 2 times 2 = 4 )- ( 1 times (-1) = -1 )Adding them up: ( -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 )Hmm, the dot product is zero. That means ( overrightarrow{a} ) is perpendicular to ( overrightarrow{n} ). So, what does that imply about the line and the plane?If the direction vector of the line is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane, the line is either parallel to the plane or lies within the plane. Because if the direction vector is perpendicular to the normal, it means the line doesn't have any component that's \\"pointing away\\" from the plane, so it can either be entirely within the plane or just parallel to it.So, that would mean the correct answer is option C: ( l parallel alpha ) or ( l subset alpha ).Wait, but let me think again. If the dot product is zero, does that necessarily mean the line is parallel or lies within the plane? Or could there be another possibility?I recall that if the direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector, the line is parallel to the plane. If the line also lies within the plane, that's a special case where it's both parallel and within. So, the general case is that it's parallel, but it could also be within.Therefore, option C seems correct because it covers both possibilities.Let me just double-check with another approach. If I have a line and a plane, the line can either be parallel, intersecting, or lying within the plane.Since the direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector, it can't be intersecting at an angle because that would require some component along the normal vector. Therefore, it must be either parallel or lying within the plane.Yes, that makes sense.

According to the problem, the complement of this angle is ( 3x - 2 ) degrees.Since the two angles are complementary, their sum should be 90 degrees.

Combining like terms:[ 4x - 2 = 90 ]To isolate ( x ), I'll add 2 to both sides of the equation:[ 4x = 92 ]Finally, I'll divide both sides by 4 to find the value of ( x ):[ x = frac{92}{4} = 23 ]So, the measure of the original angle is 23 degrees."},{"question":"The population of a town increased by 22% and 25% respectively in two consecutive years.

The company donated 10,000 masks in January and plans to donate masks every month with a monthly average growth rate of ( x ). The goal is to donate a total of 47,500 masks by the end of the first quarter, which is March.To simplify the calculations, I'll represent the number of masks donated in January as 1 (in thousands). This means the actual number of masks donated in January is 10,000.Next, I'll determine the number of masks donated in February and March. Since the growth rate is ( x ), the number of masks donated in February will be ( 1 + x ) thousand. Similarly, the number of masks donated in March will be ( (1 + x)^2 ) thousand, as the growth rate applies to the February amount.Now, I'll calculate the total number of masks donated by the end of March by summing the donations from January, February, and March:[1 + (1 + x) + (1 + x)^2]This total should equal the company's goal of 47,500 masks, which is 4.75 in thousands.Therefore, the equation that represents this situation is:[1 + (1 + x) + (1 + x)^2 = 4.75]This corresponds to option B."},{"question":"a is 30% more efficient than b.

Since A is 30% more efficient than B, this means that A can do 1.3 times the work B can do in the same amount of time.Next, I'll determine how long B alone would take to complete the job. If A can finish the job in 23 days, then B, being less efficient, would take longer. Specifically, B would take 23 days multiplied by 1.3, which equals 29.9 days.Now, I'll calculate the work rates of A and B. A's work rate is 1/23 of the job per day, and B's work rate is 1/29.9 of the job per day.To find the combined work rate when A and B work together, I'll add their individual work rates:1/23 + 1/29.9 ≈ 0.0435 + 0.0334 ≈ 0.0769 of the job per day.Finally, to determine how many days they would take to complete the job together, I'll divide the total work (1 job) by their combined work rate:1 / 0.0769 ≈ 13 days.Therefore, A and B working together will take approximately 13 days to complete the job."},{"question":"An industrial machine can make 6 shirts a minute.

What is the probability that three heads do not occur consecutively?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that when I toss a fair coin 12 times, I don't get three heads in a row. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First off, I know that when dealing with coins, each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Since the coin is fair, each outcome has a probability of 1/2. Now, if I toss the coin 12 times, the total number of possible sequences is 2^12, right? Let me calculate that real quick. 2^10 is 1024, so 2^12 should be 4096. Yeah, that seems right.So, the total number of possible outcomes is 4096. Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where there are no three consecutive heads. Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe I can think about it recursively. Like, if I know the number of valid sequences for smaller numbers of tosses, I can build up to 12.Let me denote D_n as the number of valid sequences of length n with no three consecutive heads. So, I need to find D_12. To find D_n, I guess I can think about how a valid sequence of length n can end. It can end with a tail, or it can end with one or two heads, but not three.If the sequence ends with a tail, then the first n-1 tosses can be any valid sequence of length n-1. If it ends with one head, then the first n-1 tosses must end with a tail, and the first n-2 tosses can be any valid sequence of length n-2. If it ends with two heads, then the first n-3 tosses must end with a tail, and the first n-3 tosses can be any valid sequence of length n-3.Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of it as the number of sequences where the last k tosses are heads, where k is 0, 1, or 2. So, for each n, D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-2} + D_{n-3}. Does that make sense?Let me test this with small values. For n=1, D_1 should be 2, since we can have H or T. For n=2, D_2 should be 4, since all combinations are allowed: HH, HT, TH, TT. For n=3, we have to exclude HHH, so D_3 = 7. Let me check: all 8 possible sequences minus 1 (HHH) gives 7. Okay, that works.Now, using the recurrence relation D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-2} + D_{n-3}, I can compute D_4 up to D_12. Let me start calculating:D_4 = D_3 + D_2 + D_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13D_5 = D_4 + D_3 + D_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24D_6 = D_5 + D_4 + D_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44D_7 = D_6 + D_5 + D_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81D_8 = D_7 + D_6 + D_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149D_9 = D_8 + D_7 + D_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274D_10 = D_9 + D_8 + D_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504D_11 = D_10 + D_9 + D_8 = 504 + 274 + 149 = 927D_12 = D_11 + D_10 + D_9 = 927 + 504 + 274 = 1705Okay, so D_12 is 1705. That means there are 1705 valid sequences of 12 coin tosses with no three consecutive heads. Now, to find the probability, I divide this by the total number of possible sequences, which is 4096.So, the probability is 1705 / 4096. Let me see if I can simplify this fraction or convert it to a decimal. 1705 divided by 4096. Let me do the division:4096 goes into 1705 zero times. So, 0. Let's add a decimal point and some zeros: 1705.000...4096 goes into 17050 four times (4*4096=16384). Subtracting, 17050 - 16384 = 666.Bring down the next zero: 6660. 4096 goes into 6660 once (1*4096=4096). Subtracting, 6660 - 4096 = 2564.Bring down the next zero: 25640. 4096 goes into 25640 six times (6*4096=24576). Subtracting, 25640 - 24576 = 1064.Bring down the next zero: 10640. 4096 goes into 10640 two times (2*4096=8192).

Subtracting, 24480 - 20480 = 4000.Bring down the next zero: 40000. 4096 goes into 40000 nine times (9*4096=36864). Subtracting, 40000 - 36864 = 3136.Bring down the next zero: 31360. 4096 goes into 31360 seven times (7*4096=28672). Subtracting, 31360 - 28672 = 2688.Bring down the next zero: 26880. 4096 goes into 26880 six times (6*4096=24576). Subtracting, 26880 - 24576 = 2304.Bring down the next zero: 23040. 4096 goes into 23040 five times (5*4096=20480). Subtracting, 23040 - 20480 = 2560.Bring down the next zero: 25600. 4096 goes into 25600 six times (6*4096=24576). Subtracting, 25600 - 24576 = 1024.Bring down the next zero: 10240. 4096 goes into 10240 two times (2*4096=8192). Subtracting, 10240 - 8192 = 2048.Bring down the next zero: 20480. 4096 goes into 20480 five times (5*4096=20480). Subtracting, 20480 - 20480 = 0.So, putting it all together, 1705 / 4096 ≈ 0.416. So, the probability is approximately 0.416, or 41.6%.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Especially in the division part, because that can get tricky.Starting from D_12 = 1705, total sequences = 4096.1705 divided by 4096:- 4096 * 0.4 = 1638.4- 1705 - 1638.4 = 66.6- 66.6 / 4096 ≈ 0.01625- So, total ≈ 0.4 + 0.01625 ≈ 0.41625Yeah, that seems consistent with my earlier division. So, approximately 0.416 or 41.6%.I think that's a reasonable answer. It makes sense that the probability is less than 50% because as the number of tosses increases, the chance of getting three heads in a row increases, so avoiding it becomes less likely.Just to recap, I used a recurrence relation to count the number of valid sequences, then divided by the total number of sequences to get the probability. The recurrence relation accounted for sequences ending with 0, 1, or 2 heads, ensuring that no three heads occurred consecutively. This method seems solid, and the calculations check out.I don't see any immediate errors in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that the probability is 1705/4096, which is approximately 0.416."},{"question":"Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word PROPOSITION.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of letters in the word \\"PROPOSITION.\\" Counting each letter, I find there are 10 letters in total.Next, I identify the repeated letters and their frequencies:- The letter 'P' appears twice.- The letter 'O' appears twice.- The letter 'I' appears twice.- The remaining letters (R, S, T, N) each appear once.To find the number of distinct ways to arrange these letters, I use the formula for permutations of multiset:[frac{n!}{n_1! times n_2! times ldots times n_k!}]where ( n ) is the total number of letters, and ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k ) are the frequencies of the repeated letters.Plugging in the values:[frac{10!}{2! times 2! times 2!}]Calculating the factorials:- ( 10! = 3,628,800 )- ( 2! = 2 )Substituting these into the formula:[frac{3,628,800}{2 times 2 times 2} = frac{3,628,800}{8} = 453,600]Therefore, there are 453,600 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word \\"PROPOSITION.\\""},{"question":"John had a stock of 900 books in his bookshop.

If the average value of 3 recordings on the meter was 4 volts and the sum of the three recordings is a multiple of 5, what was the smallest possible recording in volts?","answer":"First, I need to understand the problem. We have a meter that records voltage in integer values from 0 to 10 volts. There are three recordings, and their average is 4 volts. Additionally, the sum of these three recordings must be a multiple of 5. The goal is to find the smallest possible recording.To start, I'll calculate the total sum of the three recordings based on the average. Since the average is 4 volts, the total sum should be 4 multiplied by 3, which equals 12 volts.Next, I need to ensure that this total sum is a multiple of 5. The closest multiples of 5 around 12 are 10 and 15. However, 15 is too high because it exceeds the maximum possible sum with three recordings (each being at most 10 volts). Therefore, the sum must be 10 volts.Now, I need to find three integer values between 0 and 10 that add up to 10 volts. To find the smallest possible recording, I'll try to maximize the other two recordings. The maximum value for any single recording is 10 volts, but setting two recordings to 10 volts would exceed the total sum of 10. Therefore, I'll adjust the values to ensure the sum remains 10.I'll start by setting one recording to 10 volts. This leaves 0 volts for the other two recordings. However, having two recordings at 0 volts might not be the most balanced approach. I'll explore other combinations to see if I can achieve a smaller minimum recording.Trying different combinations, I find that if one recording is 5 volts, another is 5 volts, and the third is 0 volts, the sum is 10 volts. This configuration satisfies all the conditions: the average is 4 volts, the sum is a multiple of 5, and the smallest recording is 0 volts.After verifying that no other combination allows for a smaller minimum recording while meeting all the criteria, I conclude that the smallest possible recording is 0 volts."},{"question":"A cylinder and a cone have the same base and height.

Find:(1) The measure of angle C;(2) The length of the smallest side in △ABC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle ABC, and I know the tangents of angles A and B, which are tanA = 1/4 and tanB = 3/5. Also, the length of side AB is given as sqrt(17). I need to find the measure of angle C and the length of the smallest side in triangle ABC.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, or π radians. So, angle C is equal to π minus the sum of angles A and B. That is, C = π - (A + B). To find angle C, I need to find angles A and B first.Since I know tanA and tanB, I can find angles A and B using the arctangent function. But before I jump into that, I recall that there's a formula for tan(A + B). The formula is:tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB)Plugging in the given values:tan(A + B) = (1/4 + 3/5) / (1 - (1/4)(3/5))Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: 1/4 + 3/5. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 20.1/4 = 5/20 and 3/5 = 12/20, so 5/20 + 12/20 = 17/20.Denominator: 1 - (1/4)(3/5) = 1 - 3/20 = 17/20.So tan(A + B) = (17/20) / (17/20) = 1.Hmm, tan(A + B) = 1. So A + B is an angle whose tangent is 1. The principal value for tan inverse of 1 is π/4, but since A and B are angles in a triangle, they must each be between 0 and π/2 (since their tangents are positive, meaning they are acute angles). Therefore, A + B = π/4.Wait, that can't be right because if A + B = π/4, then angle C would be π - π/4 = 3π/4, which is 135 degrees. That seems possible, but let me double-check my calculation.Wait, tan(A + B) = 1, so A + B could be π/4 or 5π/4, but since A and B are both acute angles, their sum must be less than π. So A + B = π/4. Therefore, angle C is π - π/4 = 3π/4. So angle C is 135 degrees or 3π/4 radians. That seems correct.So for part (1), the measure of angle C is 3π/4 radians.Now, moving on to part (2), finding the length of the smallest side in triangle ABC. The sides opposite the smaller angles are shorter. Since angle C is 135 degrees, which is the largest angle, the side opposite to it, which is AB, is the longest side. So the smallest side must be opposite the smallest angle.Looking at angles A and B, since tanA = 1/4 and tanB = 3/5, which is approximately 0.25 and 0.6, respectively. So angle B is larger than angle A because tanB is larger. Therefore, angle A is the smallest angle, so the side opposite to angle A, which is BC, is the shortest side.So I need to find the length of side BC.To find the length of side BC, I can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. That is:AB / sinC = BC / sinA = AC / sinBWe know AB is sqrt(17), and angle C is 3π/4. So let's compute sinC first.sin(3π/4) is sin(135 degrees), which is sqrt(2)/2.So, AB / sinC = sqrt(17) / (sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(17) * 2 / sqrt(2) = (2 sqrt(17)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(34).Wait, let me compute that again:sqrt(17) divided by (sqrt(2)/2) is sqrt(17) * (2 / sqrt(2)) = (2 sqrt(17)) / sqrt(2). Rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):(2 sqrt(17) * sqrt(2)) / 2 = sqrt(34). So the ratio is sqrt(34).So, AB / sinC = sqrt(34). Therefore, BC / sinA = sqrt(34). So BC = sqrt(34) * sinA.Now, I need to find sinA. Since tanA = 1/4, I can construct a right triangle where the opposite side is 1 and the adjacent side is 4. Then, the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(1 + 16) = sqrt(17). Therefore, sinA = opposite / hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(17). Rationalizing, sinA = sqrt(17)/17.So, BC = sqrt(34) * (sqrt(17)/17).Let me compute that:sqrt(34) * sqrt(17) = sqrt(34 * 17) = sqrt(578). Hmm, 578 is 17*34, which is 17*2*17, so 2*17^2. Therefore, sqrt(578) = sqrt(2 * 17^2) = 17 sqrt(2).So, BC = (17 sqrt(2)) / 17 = sqrt(2).Therefore, the length of side BC is sqrt(2), which is the smallest side.Wait, let me verify that. If BC is sqrt(2), and AB is sqrt(17), then AC can be found similarly. Let me compute AC as well to ensure that sqrt(2) is indeed the smallest.Using the Law of Sines again, AC / sinB = sqrt(34). So AC = sqrt(34) * sinB.We know tanB = 3/5, so in a right triangle, opposite side is 3, adjacent is 5, hypotenuse is sqrt(3^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34). Therefore, sinB = 3 / sqrt(34). So AC = sqrt(34) * (3 / sqrt(34)) = 3.So, AC is 3, AB is sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123, and BC is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. So indeed, BC is the smallest side.Therefore, the measure of angle C is 3π/4, and the length of the smallest side is sqrt(2)."},{"question":"Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence, and a_n > 0, a_2a_4 + 2a_3a_5 + a_4a_6 = 25, then the value of a_3 + a_5 is ( ).A: 5B: 10C: 15D: 20","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence, and a_n > 0, a_2a_4 + 2a_3a_5 + a_4a_6 = 25, then the value of a_3 + a_5 is ( ).\\"And the options are A: 5, B: 10, C: 15, D: 20.Alright, so first, let's recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, if the first term is a_1, then the sequence goes a_1, a_1*r, a_1*r^2, a_1*r^3, and so on.Given that, each term can be expressed as a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1). So, for example, a_2 = a_1 * r, a_3 = a_1 * r^2, a_4 = a_1 * r^3, etc.Now, the problem gives me an equation involving products of terms: a_2a_4 + 2a_3a_5 + a_4a_6 = 25. I need to find the value of a_3 + a_5.Hmm, okay. Let's write down each of these terms using the formula for a geometric sequence.First, let's express each term:a_2 = a_1 * ra_3 = a_1 * r^2a_4 = a_1 * r^3a_5 = a_1 * r^4a_6 = a_1 * r^5So, let's compute each product:a_2a_4 = (a_1 * r) * (a_1 * r^3) = a_1^2 * r^4Similarly, a_3a_5 = (a_1 * r^2) * (a_1 * r^4) = a_1^2 * r^6And a_4a_6 = (a_1 * r^3) * (a_1 * r^5) = a_1^2 * r^8So, substituting back into the given equation:a_2a_4 + 2a_3a_5 + a_4a_6 = 25Which becomes:a_1^2 * r^4 + 2*(a_1^2 * r^6) + a_1^2 * r^8 = 25Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out a common term. Let's see, each term has a_1^2 and some power of r.Looking at the exponents of r: 4, 6, 8. So, they are all even numbers, and each is 2 more than the previous. Maybe I can factor out a_1^2 * r^4, which is the smallest power.So, factoring out a_1^2 * r^4:a_1^2 * r^4 * [1 + 2r^2 + r^4] = 25Hmm, inside the brackets, we have 1 + 2r^2 + r^4. Wait, that looks like a quadratic in terms of r^2. Let me set x = r^2. Then the expression becomes:1 + 2x + x^2, which is (x + 1)^2.So, substituting back, we have:a_1^2 * r^4 * (r^2 + 1)^2 = 25But wait, let's see:Original expression after factoring:a_1^2 * r^4 * [1 + 2r^2 + r^4] = a_1^2 * r^4 * (1 + r^2)^2 = 25So, that's equal to 25.Now, let's see if we can write this in terms of a_3 and a_5.Wait, a_3 = a_1 * r^2, and a_5 = a_1 * r^4.So, a_3 = a_1 * r^2, so a_1 = a_3 / r^2.Similarly, a_5 = a_1 * r^4, so a_1 = a_5 / r^4.But maybe instead of that, let's see:We have a_1^2 * r^4 * (1 + r^2)^2 = 25But a_1 * r^2 is a_3, so a_1^2 * r^4 = (a_3)^2.Similarly, (1 + r^2)^2 is (1 + r^2)^2.So, the equation becomes:(a_3)^2 * (1 + r^2)^2 = 25Wait, but that might not be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, let's think about the expression a_3 + a_5.We need to find a_3 + a_5. Let's express that in terms of a_1 and r.a_3 + a_5 = a_1 * r^2 + a_1 * r^4 = a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2)Hmm, so a_3 + a_5 = a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2)Looking back at our earlier equation:a_1^2 * r^4 * (1 + r^2)^2 = 25Notice that a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2) is exactly (a_3 + a_5). Let me denote S = a_3 + a_5.So, S = a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2)Then, our equation becomes:(a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2))^2 = 25Which is S^2 = 25Therefore, S = sqrt(25) = 5 or S = -5But since all terms a_n are positive (given a_n > 0), S must be positive. So, S = 5.Therefore, a_3 + a_5 = 5.So, the answer is A: 5.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the given equation:a_2a_4 + 2a_3a_5 + a_4a_6 = 25Expressed in terms of a_1 and r, it's:a_1^2 r^4 + 2 a_1^2 r^6 + a_1^2 r^8 = 25Factoring out a_1^2 r^4:a_1^2 r^4 (1 + 2 r^2 + r^4) = 25Recognizing that 1 + 2 r^2 + r^4 is (1 + r^2)^2, so:a_1^2 r^4 (1 + r^2)^2 = 25Which is (a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2))^2 = 25But a_1 r^2 (1 + r^2) is a_3 + a_5, so:(a_3 + a_5)^2 = 25Thus, a_3 + a_5 = 5Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 5, which is option A.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. The key was recognizing the expression as a perfect square and relating it to a_3 + a_5.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given that there are m distinct positive even numbers and n distinct positive odd numbers such that their sum is 2015. Find the maximum value of 20m + 15n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of 20m + 15n, given that there are m distinct positive even numbers and n distinct positive odd numbers whose sum is 2015. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I notice that 20m + 15n can be factored as 5*(4m + 3n). So, if I can maximize 4m + 3n, then I can just multiply by 5 to get the desired result. That seems like a good starting point.Now, I need to figure out how to maximize 4m + 3n under the constraint that the sum of m even numbers and n odd numbers is 2015. Since all the numbers are distinct, I should consider the smallest possible even and odd numbers to minimize the total sum, which would allow me to maximize m and n.Let me recall that the sum of the first m distinct even numbers is 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 2m, which is equal to m*(m + 1). Similarly, the sum of the first n distinct odd numbers is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1), which is equal to n². So, the total sum would be m*(m + 1) + n², and this should be less than or equal to 2015.So, I have the inequality:m(m + 1) + n² ≤ 2015I need to maximize 4m + 3n under this constraint. Hmm, this feels like an optimization problem with a quadratic constraint. Maybe I can use some inequality here, like Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM, but I'm not sure yet.Wait, let me think about introducing variables to simplify this. If I let x = 2m + 1 and y = 2n, then x and y would be integers. Let me see why:- For the even numbers, the smallest sum is m(m + 1), which is equal to (2m + 1 - 1)/2 * (2m + 1). Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.- For the odd numbers, the sum is n², which is (2n)² / 4. So, if I let y = 2n, then the sum of odd numbers is (y²)/4.Wait, maybe I can rewrite the total sum as:m(m + 1) + n² ≤ 2015But m(m + 1) is approximately m² + m, so it's roughly m², and n² is n². So, maybe I can approximate this as m² + n² ≤ 2015. But actually, m(m + 1) is a bit more than m², so maybe m² + m + n² ≤ 2015.Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me try substituting x and y as I thought before. Let x = 2m + 1 and y = 2n. Then:- The sum of even numbers is m(m + 1) = (x - 1)/2 * (x + 1)/2 = (x² - 1)/4- The sum of odd numbers is n² = (y²)/4So, the total sum is:(x² - 1)/4 + y²/4 ≤ 2015Multiplying both sides by 4:x² - 1 + y² ≤ 8060So,x² + y² ≤ 8061Hmm, okay, so x² + y² is approximately 8061. Now, I need to maximize 4m + 3n. Let's express 4m + 3n in terms of x and y.Since x = 2m + 1, then m = (x - 1)/2. Similarly, y = 2n, so n = y/2.Therefore,4m + 3n = 4*(x - 1)/2 + 3*(y/2) = 2*(x - 1) + (3y)/2 = 2x - 2 + (3y)/2Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe instead of substituting, I can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the original variables.Wait, let's think about Cauchy-Schwarz. If I have two vectors, say (4, 3) and (m, n), then the dot product is 4m + 3n, which is what I want to maximize. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:(4m + 3n)² ≤ (4² + 3²)*(m² + n²)But wait, I have m(m + 1) + n² ≤ 2015, not m² + n². So, maybe I need to adjust.Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overcomplicating things for an integer problem.Wait, another thought: since m and n are integers, maybe I can bound 4m + 3n.Let me consider that m(m + 1) + n² ≤ 2015. Since m(m + 1) is roughly m², and n² is n², the total is roughly m² + n² ≤ 2015. So, m² + n² ≤ 2015.But actually, m(m + 1) = m² + m, so it's a bit more than m². So, m² + m + n² ≤ 2015.But to get an upper bound, maybe I can ignore the m term, so m² + n² ≤ 2015. Then, using Cauchy-Schwarz:(4m + 3n)² ≤ (4² + 3²)*(m² + n²) = 25*(m² + n²) ≤ 25*2015 = 50375So, 4m + 3n ≤ sqrt(50375) ≈ 224.45But since 4m + 3n must be an integer, the maximum possible value is 224. However, I think this is an upper bound, but maybe the actual maximum is less because m(m + 1) + n² is less than or equal to 2015.Wait, but in my earlier substitution, I had x² + y² ≤ 8061, which is about 8061. So, sqrt(8061) ≈ 89.8, but that was for x and y, which are 2m +1 and 2n. So, maybe I can use Cauchy-Schwarz on x and y.Let me try that. So, (x² + y²)(16 + 9) ≥ (4x + 6y)². Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier.So, (x² + y²)*25 ≥ (4x + 6y)²But since x² + y² ≤ 8061,25*8061 ≥ (4x + 6y)²So, 201525 ≥ (4x + 6y)²Taking square roots,4x + 6y ≤ sqrt(201525) ≈ 449But 4x + 6y = 4*(2m +1) + 6*(2n) = 8m +4 +12n = 8m +12n +4Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since I need to maximize 4m + 3n, and I have the constraint m(m +1) + n² ≤ 2015.Let me try to express 4m + 3n in terms of m and n, and see if I can find a relationship.Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, treating m and n as real numbers, find the maximum, and then adjust to integers.Let me set up the Lagrangian:L = 4m + 3n - λ(m(m +1) + n² - 2015)Taking partial derivatives:dL/dm = 4 - λ(2m +1) = 0dL/dn = 3 - λ(2n) = 0dL/dλ = -(m(m +1) + n² - 2015) = 0From the first equation:4 = λ(2m +1) => λ = 4 / (2m +1)From the second equation:3 = λ(2n) => λ = 3 / (2n)Setting them equal:4 / (2m +1) = 3 / (2n)Cross-multiplying:8n = 6m + 3Simplify:8n = 6m +3 => 8n -6m =3 => 4n -3m = 1.5Hmm, but m and n are integers, so 4n -3m must be 1.5, which is not possible. So, maybe this suggests that the maximum occurs at the boundary of the feasible region.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me double-check:From dL/dm = 4 - λ(2m +1) =0 => λ =4/(2m +1)From dL/dn =3 - λ(2n)=0 => λ=3/(2n)So, 4/(2m +1) = 3/(2n) => 8n =6m +3 => 8n -6m =3 => 4n -3m =1.5Yes, that's correct. So, since m and n are integers, 4n -3m must be 1.5, which is not possible. Therefore, the maximum must occur at the boundary.So, perhaps I need to find integer values of m and n such that 4n -3m is as close as possible to 1.5, either 1 or 2.Let me try 4n -3m =1 and 4n -3m=2.Case 1: 4n -3m=1Then, 4n =3m +1 => n=(3m +1)/4Since n must be integer, 3m +1 must be divisible by 4. So, 3m ≡ -1 mod4 => 3m ≡3 mod4 => m≡1 mod4So, m=4k +1, then n=(3*(4k +1)+1)/4=(12k +3 +1)/4=(12k +4)/4=3k +1So, n=3k +1, m=4k +1Case 2:4n -3m=2Then, 4n=3m +2 =>n=(3m +2)/4So, 3m +2 must be divisible by4 =>3m≡2 mod4 =>3m≡2 mod4 => m≡2 mod4 (since 3*2=6≡2 mod4)So, m=4k +2, then n=(3*(4k +2)+2)/4=(12k +6 +2)/4=(12k +8)/4=3k +2So, n=3k +2, m=4k +2So, these are the two cases where 4n -3m is either 1 or 2.Now, I need to find k such that m(m +1) +n² ≤2015.Let me first consider Case1: m=4k +1, n=3k +1Compute m(m +1) +n²:m=4k +1, so m +1=4k +2Thus, m(m +1)=(4k +1)(4k +2)=16k² +12k +2n=3k +1, so n²=9k² +6k +1Total sum:16k² +12k +2 +9k² +6k +1=25k² +18k +3Set this ≤2015:25k² +18k +3 ≤2015 =>25k² +18k ≤2012Let me solve 25k² +18k -2012 ≤0Using quadratic formula:k = [-18 ±sqrt(18² +4*25*2012)]/(2*25)Compute discriminant:18²=3244*25*2012=100*2012=201200Total discriminant=324 +201200=201524sqrt(201524)=449 (since 449²=201601, which is a bit more, so sqrt(201524)=449 - (201601 -201524)/ (2*449)=449 -77/898≈449 -0.086≈448.914So, k=( -18 +448.914)/50≈430.914/50≈8.618So, k≤8.618, so maximum integer k=8So, for k=8:m=4*8 +1=33n=3*8 +1=25Compute total sum:25k² +18k +3=25*64 +18*8 +3=1600 +144 +3=1747 ≤2015So, that's valid.Now, let's check k=9:m=4*9 +1=37n=3*9 +1=28Compute total sum:25*81 +18*9 +3=2025 +162 +3=2190>2015Too big.So, maximum k=8, giving m=33, n=25.Compute 4m +3n=4*33 +3*25=132 +75=207Case2: m=4k +2, n=3k +2Compute m(m +1) +n²:m=4k +2, m +1=4k +3So, m(m +1)=(4k +2)(4k +3)=16k² +20k +6n=3k +2, n²=9k² +12k +4Total sum:16k² +20k +6 +9k² +12k +4=25k² +32k +10Set this ≤2015:25k² +32k +10 ≤2015 =>25k² +32k ≤2005Solve 25k² +32k -2005 ≤0Quadratic formula:k = [-32 ±sqrt(32² +4*25*2005)]/(2*25)Compute discriminant:32²=10244*25*2005=100*2005=200500Total discriminant=1024 +200500=201524Same as before, sqrt(201524)=449 approximatelySo, k=( -32 +449)/50≈417/50≈8.34So, maximum integer k=8For k=8:m=4*8 +2=34n=3*8 +2=26Compute total sum:25*64 +32*8 +10=1600 +256 +10=1866 ≤2015Valid.Check k=9:m=4*9 +2=38n=3*9 +2=29Compute total sum:25*81 +32*9 +10=2025 +288 +10=2323>2015Too big.So, maximum k=8, giving m=34, n=26Compute 4m +3n=4*34 +3*26=136 +78=214So, in Case1, we got 207, and in Case2, 214. So, 214 is higher.But wait, maybe we can go higher by not following these cases strictly, but adjusting m and n a bit.Because in the Lagrangian method, we found that the optimal point is where 4n -3m=1.5, which is not possible for integers, but maybe by adjusting m and n slightly, we can get a better value.Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find m and n such that 4m +3n is as large as possible, while keeping m(m +1) +n² ≤2015.Let me try to set up an equation:Let me denote S = m(m +1) +n² ≤2015I need to maximize 4m +3n.Let me express n in terms of m:n² ≤2015 -m(m +1)So, n ≤sqrt(2015 -m(m +1))But since n must be integer, n ≤floor(sqrt(2015 -m(m +1)))But this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can fix m and compute the maximum n, then compute 4m +3n, and see which gives the maximum.But this would be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.Alternatively, let me consider that for a given m, the maximum n is floor(sqrt(2015 -m(m +1)))So, 4m +3n is maximized when n is as large as possible for a given m.So, perhaps I can write a function f(m)=4m +3*floor(sqrt(2015 -m(m +1)))And find the m that maximizes f(m).But since I can't compute this for all m, maybe I can estimate.Let me approximate.Assume that n² ≈2015 -m² -mSo, n≈sqrt(2015 -m² -m)Then, 4m +3n ≈4m +3*sqrt(2015 -m² -m)To maximize this, take derivative with respect to m.Let me set f(m)=4m +3*sqrt(2015 -m² -m)Compute derivative:f’(m)=4 +3*(1/(2*sqrt(2015 -m² -m)))*(-2m -1)Set derivative to zero:4 +3*(-2m -1)/(2*sqrt(2015 -m² -m))=0Multiply both sides by 2*sqrt(2015 -m² -m):8*sqrt(2015 -m² -m) -3*(2m +1)=0So,8*sqrt(2015 -m² -m)=3*(2m +1)Square both sides:64*(2015 -m² -m)=9*(4m² +4m +1)Compute:64*2015=128, 64*2000=128,000, 64*15=960, so total=128,960So, 128,960 -64m² -64m=36m² +36m +9Bring all terms to left:128,960 -64m² -64m -36m² -36m -9=0Combine like terms:-100m² -100m +128,951=0Multiply both sides by -1:100m² +100m -128,951=0Divide by 100:m² +m -1289.51=0Solutions:m = [-1 ±sqrt(1 +4*1289.51)]/2Compute discriminant:1 +4*1289.51=1 +5158.04=5159.04sqrt(5159.04)=71.8 (since 71²=5041, 72²=5184, so sqrt(5159.04)=71.8)So,m=(-1 +71.8)/2≈70.8/2≈35.4So, m≈35.4So, around m=35, let's check m=35.Compute n:n² ≤2015 -35*36=2015 -1260=755So, n≤floor(sqrt(755))=27 (since 27²=729, 28²=784>755)So, n=27Compute 4m +3n=4*35 +3*27=140 +81=221Now, check m=36:n² ≤2015 -36*37=2015 -1332=683n≤floor(sqrt(683))=26 (26²=676, 27²=729>683)So, n=26Compute 4m +3n=4*36 +3*26=144 +78=222Wait, that's higher than 221.But wait, m=36, n=26: sum is 36*37 +26²=1332 +676=2008 ≤2015Yes, that's valid.But wait, 4m +3n=222But earlier, in Case2, with k=8, m=34, n=26, 4m +3n=214So, 222 is higher.Wait, but when m=36, n=26, sum is 2008, which is less than 2015. So, maybe we can increase n by 1.Wait, n=27:n²=729Sum would be 36*37 +27²=1332 +729=2061>2015Too big.So, n=26 is maximum.So, 4m +3n=222.Wait, but earlier, when m=35, n=27, sum=35*36 +27²=1260 +729=1989, which is less than 2015.So, we have 2015 -1989=26 left.So, can we adjust the numbers to use up the remaining 26?Because the initial assumption was using the smallest m even and n odd numbers, but maybe we can increase some of them to use up the remaining sum.So, for m=35, n=27, sum=1989, remaining=26.We can distribute this 26 among the numbers, but keeping them distinct.Since the even numbers are 2,4,...,70, sum=1260.The odd numbers are 1,3,...,53, sum=729.Total=1989.We have 26 left. So, we can add 26 to the largest number, making it 70 +26=96, but we need to ensure that all numbers remain distinct.Wait, but if we add 26 to the largest even number, which is 70, making it 96, but we have to check if 96 is already in the odd numbers. Since all odd numbers are up to 53, 96 is even and larger than 70, so it's fine.So, the even numbers would be 2,4,...,70, but the last one is 96 instead of 70.Wait, but 96 is 2*48, but we only have 35 even numbers. So, the even numbers would be 2,4,...,70, but replacing 70 with 96.But wait, 70 is the 35th even number (since 2*35=70). So, replacing 70 with 96, which is 2*48, but 48>35, so we are effectively adding a larger even number beyond the initial 35.But does that affect the count of m? Because m is the number of even numbers, which is still 35, but one of them is larger.So, the sum of even numbers becomes 1260 -70 +96=1260 +26=1286Sum of odd numbers remains 729Total sum=1286 +729=2015Perfect.So, in this case, m=35, n=27, and the sum is exactly 2015.So, 4m +3n=4*35 +3*27=140 +81=221But earlier, when m=36, n=26, sum=2008, which is less than 2015, but 4m +3n=222, which is higher.But wait, can we adjust m=36, n=26 to reach sum=2015?Sum=36*37 +26²=1332 +676=2008Remaining=2015 -2008=7So, we need to add 7 to the numbers.We can add 7 to the largest number, but need to keep them distinct.The even numbers are 2,4,...,72, sum=1332The odd numbers are 1,3,...,51, sum=676Total=2008Add 7 to the largest even number, 72, making it 79, but 79 is odd, which conflicts with the odd numbers.Alternatively, add 7 to the largest odd number, 51, making it 58, but 58 is even, which conflicts with the even numbers.Alternatively, add 7 to the second largest even number, 70, making it 77, which is odd, but 77 is already in the odd numbers? Wait, n=26, so the largest odd number is 51, so 77 is beyond that, so it's okay.Wait, but 77 is odd, and we have n=26 odd numbers up to 51, so 77 is a new odd number, but we already have 26 odd numbers. So, we can't add another one.Alternatively, maybe we can adjust multiple numbers.Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with m=35, n=27, which can reach the exact sum by adjusting one number.So, in that case, 4m +3n=221But earlier, with m=36, n=26, we have 4m +3n=222, but the sum is 2008, which is 7 less than 2015. So, maybe we can adjust some numbers to add 7 without violating the distinctness.Let me try:For m=36, n=26, sum=2008We need to add 7.Let me consider the even numbers: 2,4,...,72, sum=1332Odd numbers:1,3,...,51, sum=676Total=2008We need to add 7.One way is to increase the largest even number, 72, by 7, making it 79, which is odd. But 79 is not in the odd numbers (since n=26, largest odd is 51), so it's okay. But now, 79 is odd, so we have an extra odd number, but n=26, so we can't have 27 odd numbers.Alternatively, we can increase the largest even number by 7, making it 79, and remove the largest odd number, 51, and add 79 as an odd number. But then, n would become 27, m=36, but 4m +3n=4*36 +3*27=144 +81=225, which is higher.Wait, but does that work?Let me see:Original even numbers:2,4,...,72 (36 numbers), sum=1332Original odd numbers:1,3,...,51 (26 numbers), sum=676Total=2008We need to reach 2015, so add 7.If we replace the largest even number,72, with 79 (which is 72 +7), and remove the largest odd number,51, and add 79 as an odd number.But wait, 79 is larger than 51, so we can add it as a new odd number, making n=27.But then, m=36, n=27, but we have to check if the sum is correct.Sum of even numbers:1332 -72 +0=1260 (since we removed 72 and didn't add anything else even)Sum of odd numbers:676 -51 +79=676 +28=704Total sum=1260 +704=1964, which is less than 2015. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, no, actually, if we remove 72 from even numbers and add 79 as an odd number, the sum of even numbers becomes 1332 -72=1260, and the sum of odd numbers becomes 676 +79=755Total sum=1260 +755=2015Yes, that works.So, now, m=36 -1=35 (since we removed one even number), n=26 +1=27Wait, no, m was 36, but we removed one even number, so m=35, and n=27.Wait, but that's the same as the previous case.Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Wait, perhaps the correct way is:We have m=36, n=26, sum=2008We need to add 7.We can increase one of the even numbers by 7, making it 7 larger, but ensuring it doesn't conflict with the odd numbers.For example, increase 72 to 79, which is odd, but since we have n=26, we can't have another odd number. So, instead, maybe increase an even number that is not the largest.Wait, maybe increase 70 to 77, which is odd, but again, n=26, so we can't add another odd number.Alternatively, increase 68 to 75, which is odd, same problem.Hmm, seems tricky.Alternatively, maybe increase two even numbers by 3 and 4, making them 75 and 76, but 75 is odd, which conflicts.Wait, maybe it's not possible to adjust without increasing n, which would require decreasing m.So, perhaps the maximum 4m +3n is 221, achieved by m=35, n=27.But earlier, with m=36, n=26, we have 4m +3n=222, but the sum is 2008, which is 7 less than 2015, and we can't adjust without increasing n, which would require decreasing m.So, perhaps 221 is the maximum.Wait, but let me check m=34, n=28.Compute sum:m=34, m(m +1)=34*35=1190n=28, n²=784Total=1190 +784=1974 ≤2015Remaining=2015 -1974=41So, we can add 41 to the numbers.Let me try to adjust the largest even number.Even numbers:2,4,...,68, sum=1190Odd numbers:1,3,...,55, sum=784Total=1974Add 41 to the largest even number, 68, making it 109, which is odd, but n=28, so the largest odd number is 55, so 109 is beyond that.Alternatively, add 41 to the largest odd number,55, making it 96, which is even, but m=34, so the largest even number is 68, so 96 is beyond that.Alternatively, add 41 to the second largest even number,66, making it 107, which is odd, but again, n=28, so 107 is beyond.Alternatively, maybe distribute the 41 among multiple numbers.But this might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with m=35, n=27, which can reach the exact sum.So, in that case, 4m +3n=221But earlier, with m=36, n=26, we have 4m +3n=222, but the sum is 2008, which is 7 less than 2015, and we can't adjust without increasing n, which would require decreasing m.So, perhaps 221 is the maximum.Wait, but let me check m=37, n=25.Sum:m=37, m(m +1)=37*38=1406n=25, n²=625Total=1406 +625=2031>2015Too big.So, m=36, n=26: sum=2008m=35, n=27: sum=1989Wait, 1989 is less than 2008, but 4m +3n=221 vs 222.So, 222 is higher, but the sum is 2008, which is 7 less.But we can't adjust to reach 2015 without increasing n, which would require decreasing m.So, perhaps 221 is the maximum.Alternatively, maybe there's a way to adjust m=36, n=26 to reach sum=2015 by increasing some numbers without increasing n.Wait, let me think.If I have m=36, n=26, sum=2008I need to add 7.I can increase one of the even numbers by 7, making it 7 larger, but ensuring it doesn't conflict with the odd numbers.For example, increase 72 to 79, which is odd, but n=26, so 79 is beyond the current odd numbers.Alternatively, increase 70 to 77, which is odd, same problem.Alternatively, increase 68 to 75, which is odd.Same issue.Alternatively, increase two even numbers by 3 and 4, making them 75 and 76, but 75 is odd.Alternatively, maybe increase three even numbers by 2, 3, and 2, making them 74, 75, 76, but 75 is odd.Hmm, seems difficult.Alternatively, maybe increase the largest even number by 7, making it 79, and adjust the largest odd number to be 79, but that would require increasing n to 27, which would decrease m to 35.So, in that case, m=35, n=27, sum=2015, and 4m +3n=221So, 221 is the maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of 20m +15n=5*(4m +3n)=5*221=1105So, the answer is 1105."},{"question":"Hockey teams receive 3 points when they win and 2 points when they tie. In 1 season, a team won a championship with 85 points. They won 15 games more than they tied.

I'll start by defining the variables: let ( T ) represent the number of ties and ( W ) represent the number of wins.According to the problem, the team won 15 more games than they tied. This gives me the equation:[ W = T + 15 ]Next, I know that each win earns the team 3 points and each tie earns 2 points. The total points earned by the team is 85.

Then, the line ( AB ) passes through a fixed point. Find the coordinates of this fixed point.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Choose a point P on the line x = 3 and draw two tangents from P to the circle x² + (y - 2)² = 4, which touch the circle at points A and B. Then, the line AB passes through a fixed point. I need to find the coordinates of this fixed point.Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. There's a circle centered at (0, 2) with a radius of 2, right? Because the equation is x² + (y - 2)² = 4. So, the center is at (0, 2) and radius 2. Then, there's a vertical line x = 3. Point P is somewhere on this vertical line, so its coordinates are (3, y₀), where y₀ can be any real number.From point P, we draw two tangents to the circle. These tangents touch the circle at points A and B. Then, if we draw the line connecting A and B, it's supposed to pass through a fixed point, regardless of where P is on the line x = 3. So, no matter where I choose P on x = 3, the line AB will always pass through this fixed point. I need to find that point.Okay, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that for a circle, the tangent from an external point has some properties. Maybe I can use the equation of the tangent to the circle from point P.First, let me recall the general equation of a tangent to a circle. For a circle with center (h, k) and radius r, the equation of the tangent from an external point (x₁, y₁) is given by:[(x₁ - h)(x - h) + (y₁ - k)(y - k) = r²]Wait, no, that's not quite right. That's the equation of the tangent line, but actually, I think it's derived from the condition that the distance from the point to the line is equal to the radius.Alternatively, another formula for the tangent from an external point is:[(y - k) = m(x - h) pm rsqrt{1 + m²}]But I might be mixing things up. Maybe it's better to use the condition that the distance from the point to the circle is equal to the radius.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the tangent from point P will satisfy the condition that the distance from P to the tangent line is equal to the radius. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, I can use the parametric equations of the circle and find the points of tangency.Let me try to set up the problem step by step.Given point P(3, y₀). The circle is x² + (y - 2)² = 4. So, center at (0, 2), radius 2.I need to find the equations of the two tangents from P to the circle. Then, find the points A and B where these tangents touch the circle. Then, find the equation of line AB and see if it passes through a fixed point.So, first, let's find the equations of the tangents from P(3, y₀) to the circle x² + (y - 2)² = 4.I remember that the equation of a tangent to a circle can be written in the form:[xx₁ + (y - 2)(y₁ - 2) = 4]Wait, no. That's for the point of tangency (x₁, y₁). But I don't know the points of tangency yet.Alternatively, the equation of the tangent from an external point (x₀, y₀) to the circle x² + (y - 2)² = 4 can be found using the formula:[(x₀)x + (y₀ - 2)(y - 2) = 4]But I think that's only for the case when the tangent is at a specific point. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, another method is to use the fact that the tangent from point P will satisfy the condition that the distance from P to the tangent line is equal to the radius.But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use the condition that the line from P to the circle is tangent, so the system of equations (the line and the circle) will have exactly one solution.So, let me assume that the tangent line has a slope m. Then, the equation of the tangent line is:[y - y₀ = m(x - 3)]This line should touch the circle x² + (y - 2)² = 4 at exactly one point. So, substituting y from the line into the circle equation should give a quadratic equation with exactly one solution, meaning the discriminant is zero.Let me do that.Substitute y = m(x - 3) + y₀ into the circle equation:[x² + (m(x - 3) + y₀ - 2)² = 4]Let me expand this:First, expand the second term:[(m(x - 3) + y₀ - 2)² = m²(x - 3)² + 2m(x - 3)(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)²]So, the equation becomes:[x² + m²(x² - 6x + 9) + 2m(x - 3)(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² = 4]Now, let's expand all terms:First term: x²Second term: m²x² - 6m²x + 9m²Third term: 2m(x - 3)(y₀ - 2) = 2m(y₀ - 2)x - 6m(y₀ - 2)Fourth term: (y₀ - 2)²So, combining all terms:x² + m²x² - 6m²x + 9m² + 2m(y₀ - 2)x - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² = 4Now, let's collect like terms:x² terms: 1 + m²x terms: -6m² + 2m(y₀ - 2)constant terms: 9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)²So, the equation is:(1 + m²)x² + (-6m² + 2m(y₀ - 2))x + (9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² - 4) = 0Since this is a tangent, the discriminant should be zero.The discriminant D of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is D = b² - 4ac.So, let's compute D:D = [ -6m² + 2m(y₀ - 2) ]² - 4*(1 + m²)*(9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² - 4) = 0This looks complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.Let me denote some terms to make it manageable.Let me set A = 1 + m²B = -6m² + 2m(y₀ - 2)C = 9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² - 4So, D = B² - 4AC = 0Compute B²:B² = [ -6m² + 2m(y₀ - 2) ]² = ( -6m² )² + (2m(y₀ - 2))² + 2*(-6m²)*(2m(y₀ - 2))= 36m⁴ + 4m²(y₀ - 2)² - 24m³(y₀ - 2)Now, compute 4AC:4AC = 4*(1 + m²)*(9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² - 4)Let me compute the term inside the second parenthesis:9m² - 6m(y₀ - 2) + (y₀ - 2)² - 4Let me denote (y₀ - 2) as k for simplicity.So, it becomes:9m² - 6mk + k² - 4So, 4AC = 4*(1 + m²)*(9m² - 6mk + k² - 4)Now, let's compute 4AC:First, expand (1 + m²)*(9m² - 6mk + k² - 4):= 1*(9m² - 6mk + k² - 4) + m²*(9m² - 6mk + k² - 4)= 9m² - 6mk + k² - 4 + 9m⁴ - 6m³k + m²k² - 4m²Combine like terms:= 9m⁴ + (9m² - 4m²) + (-6m³k) + (-6mk) + (k² + m²k²) + (-4)= 9m⁴ + 5m² - 6m³k - 6mk + k² + m²k² - 4So, 4AC = 4*(9m⁴ + 5m² - 6m³k - 6mk + k² + m²k² - 4)= 36m⁴ + 20m² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² + 4m²k² - 16Now, going back to D = B² - 4AC = 0:B² - 4AC = 0So,36m⁴ + 4m²k² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² - [36m⁴ + 20m² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² + 4m²k² - 16] = 0Wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up. Let me write it correctly.Wait, D = B² - 4AC = 0So,[36m⁴ + 4m²k² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k²] - [36m⁴ + 20m² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² + 4m²k² - 16] = 0Now, let's subtract term by term:36m⁴ - 36m⁴ = 04m²k² - 4m²k² = 0-24m³k - (-24m³k) = 0-24mk - (-24mk) = 04k² - 4k² = 0Now, the remaining terms:-20m² - (-16) = -20m² + 16Wait, no. Wait, in the second expression, it's - [36m⁴ + 20m² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² + 4m²k² - 16]So, subtracting each term:-36m⁴ - 20m² + 24m³k + 24mk - 4k² - 4m²k² + 16So, combining with B²:36m⁴ + 4m²k² - 24m³k - 24mk + 4k² -36m⁴ -20m² +24m³k +24mk -4k² -4m²k² +16 = 0Now, let's combine like terms:36m⁴ -36m⁴ = 04m²k² -4m²k² = 0-24m³k +24m³k = 0-24mk +24mk = 04k² -4k² = 0-20m² +16 = 0So, we have:-20m² + 16 = 0Thus,-20m² + 16 = 0Solving for m²:-20m² = -16m² = (-16)/(-20) = 16/20 = 4/5So, m² = 4/5Therefore, m = ±2/√5So, the slopes of the two tangents are 2/√5 and -2/√5.Okay, so now that we have the slopes, we can write the equations of the two tangent lines.Recall that the equation of the tangent line is:y - y₀ = m(x - 3)So, for m = 2/√5:y - y₀ = (2/√5)(x - 3)Similarly, for m = -2/√5:y - y₀ = (-2/√5)(x - 3)Now, these are the equations of the two tangents from P(3, y₀) to the circle.Now, we need to find the points of tangency A and B on the circle.To find points A and B, we can solve the system of the tangent line and the circle.Let me take the first tangent line: y = (2/√5)(x - 3) + y₀Substitute this into the circle equation:x² + (y - 2)² = 4So,x² + [(2/√5)(x - 3) + y₀ - 2]² = 4Let me expand this:First, let me denote (2/√5)(x - 3) + y₀ - 2 as the y-term.Let me compute this:(2/√5)x - 6/√5 + y₀ - 2So, the equation becomes:x² + [(2/√5)x - 6/√5 + y₀ - 2]² = 4Now, let's expand the square term:[(2/√5)x - 6/√5 + y₀ - 2]²= [(2/√5)x + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)]²= (2/√5 x + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5))²= (2/√5 x)² + 2*(2/√5 x)*(y₀ - 2 - 6/√5) + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)²= (4/5)x² + (4/√5)(y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)x + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)²So, the equation becomes:x² + (4/5)x² + (4/√5)(y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)x + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)² = 4Combine like terms:x² + 4/5 x² = (1 + 4/5)x² = 9/5 x²So,9/5 x² + (4/√5)(y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)x + (y₀ - 2 - 6/√5)² - 4 = 0Now, since this is a tangent, it should have exactly one solution, so the discriminant is zero.But wait, we already used that condition to find m. So, perhaps instead of solving this quadratic, which we know has one solution, we can find the point of tangency.Alternatively, since we know the slope of the tangent, we can find the point of tangency using the formula for the point of contact.I recall that for a circle centered at (h, k), the point of contact of the tangent with slope m is given by:[left( h - r frac{m}{sqrt{1 + m²}}, k + r frac{1}{sqrt{1 + m²}} right)]Wait, let me verify that.Actually, the formula for the point of contact can be derived from the fact that the radius at the point of contact is perpendicular to the tangent line.So, if the tangent has slope m, then the radius has slope -1/m.Given that, we can find the point of contact.Let me denote the center of the circle as C(0, 2). The point of contact A lies on the circle, and the line CA is perpendicular to the tangent line at A.So, the slope of CA is -1/m, where m is the slope of the tangent.Given that, we can write the equation of CA.But since CA passes through C(0, 2) and has slope -1/m, its equation is:y - 2 = (-1/m)(x - 0)So, y = (-1/m)x + 2Now, the point A lies on both the tangent line and the line CA.So, we can solve for A by solving the system:y = m(x - 3) + y₀andy = (-1/m)x + 2Set them equal:m(x - 3) + y₀ = (-1/m)x + 2Multiply both sides by m to eliminate the denominator:m²(x - 3) + m y₀ = -x + 2mBring all terms to one side:m²x - 3m² + m y₀ + x - 2m = 0Factor x:x(m² + 1) + (-3m² + m y₀ - 2m) = 0Solve for x:x = (3m² - m y₀ + 2m) / (m² + 1)Similarly, substitute back into y = (-1/m)x + 2:y = (-1/m)*(3m² - m y₀ + 2m)/(m² + 1) + 2Simplify:y = [ -3m + y₀ - 2 ] / (m² + 1) + 2= [ -3m + y₀ - 2 + 2(m² + 1) ] / (m² + 1)= [ -3m + y₀ - 2 + 2m² + 2 ] / (m² + 1)= [ 2m² - 3m + y₀ ] / (m² + 1)So, the coordinates of point A are:x = (3m² - m y₀ + 2m) / (m² + 1)y = (2m² - 3m + y₀) / (m² + 1)Similarly, for the other tangent with slope -m, we can find point B.But since m is 2/√5 and -2/√5, let's compute for m = 2/√5.First, compute x-coordinate of A:x = [3*(4/5) - (2/√5)*y₀ + 2*(2/√5)] / (4/5 + 1)Simplify denominator:4/5 + 1 = 9/5Numerator:3*(4/5) = 12/5- (2/√5)y₀+ 2*(2/√5) = 4/√5So, numerator:12/5 - (2/√5)y₀ + 4/√5So, x = [12/5 + 4/√5 - (2/√5)y₀] / (9/5)Multiply numerator and denominator by 5 to eliminate denominators:x = [12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀] / 9Similarly, compute y-coordinate:y = [2*(4/5) - 3*(2/√5) + y₀] / (4/5 + 1)Simplify denominator: 9/5Numerator:2*(4/5) = 8/5- 3*(2/√5) = -6/√5+ y₀So, numerator:8/5 - 6/√5 + y₀Thus, y = [8/5 - 6/√5 + y₀] / (9/5)Multiply numerator and denominator by 5:y = [8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀] / 9So, point A is:( [12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀] / 9 , [8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀] / 9 )Similarly, for the other tangent with slope m = -2/√5, point B will have coordinates:x = [3*(4/5) - (-2/√5)*y₀ + 2*(-2/√5)] / (4/5 + 1)= [12/5 + (2/√5)y₀ - 4/√5] / (9/5)Multiply numerator and denominator by 5:x = [12 + 2√5 y₀ - 4√5] / 9Similarly, y-coordinate:y = [2*(4/5) - 3*(-2/√5) + y₀] / (4/5 + 1)= [8/5 + 6/√5 + y₀] / (9/5)Multiply numerator and denominator by 5:y = [8 + 6√5 + 5 y₀] / 9So, point B is:( [12 + 2√5 y₀ - 4√5] / 9 , [8 + 6√5 + 5 y₀] / 9 )Now, we have points A and B. Let's denote them as:A: ( (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)/9 , (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 )B: ( (12 - 4√5 + 2√5 y₀)/9 , (8 + 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 )Now, we need to find the equation of line AB.To find the equation of line AB, we can use the two-point form.First, let's find the slope of AB.Slope m_AB = (y_B - y_A) / (x_B - x_A)Compute y_B - y_A:[ (8 + 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 ] - [ (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 ] = [8 + 6√5 + 5 y₀ - 8 + 6√5 - 5 y₀]/9 = (12√5)/9 = (4√5)/3Similarly, x_B - x_A:[ (12 - 4√5 + 2√5 y₀)/9 ] - [ (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)/9 ] = [12 - 4√5 + 2√5 y₀ -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀]/9 = (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀)/9So, slope m_AB = (4√5 / 3) / ( (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀)/9 )Simplify:= (4√5 / 3) * (9 / (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀))= (4√5 * 9) / (3 * (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀))= (36√5) / (3 * (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀))= (12√5) / (-8√5 + 4√5 y₀)Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 12√5Denominator: 4√5(-2 + y₀)So,m_AB = (12√5) / [4√5(-2 + y₀)] = (12√5) / [4√5(-2 + y₀)] = 3 / (-2 + y₀) = -3 / (y₀ - 2)So, the slope of AB is -3 / (y₀ - 2)Now, we can write the equation of AB using point A.Using point-slope form:y - y_A = m_AB (x - x_A)So,y - [ (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 ] = [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] [ x - (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)/9 ]This equation seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a fixed point that lies on this line regardless of y₀.To find a fixed point (h, k) that lies on AB for any y₀, we need to satisfy the equation for all y₀.So, substituting (h, k) into the equation:k - [ (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 ] = [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] [ h - (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)/9 ]This equation must hold for all y₀. Let's rearrange it.Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:9k - (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀) = [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] * [ 9h - (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀) ]Simplify the right side:= [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] * [ 9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀ ]Let me denote the numerator as:-3*(9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀) / (y₀ - 2)So, the equation becomes:9k -8 +6√5 -5 y₀ = [ -3*(9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀) ] / (y₀ - 2)Multiply both sides by (y₀ - 2):(9k -8 +6√5 -5 y₀)(y₀ - 2) = -3*(9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀)Now, expand the left side:= (9k -8 +6√5)(y₀ - 2) -5 y₀(y₀ - 2)= (9k -8 +6√5)y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5) -5 y₀² +10 y₀Similarly, expand the right side:= -3*9h + 3*12 + 3*4√5 - 3*2√5 y₀= -27h +36 +12√5 -6√5 y₀Now, let's write the equation:(9k -8 +6√5)y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5) -5 y₀² +10 y₀ = -27h +36 +12√5 -6√5 y₀Now, let's collect like terms:Left side:-5 y₀² + [ (9k -8 +6√5) +10 ] y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5)Right side:-27h +36 +12√5 -6√5 y₀Bring all terms to the left side:-5 y₀² + [ (9k -8 +6√5) +10 ] y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5) +27h -36 -12√5 +6√5 y₀ = 0Now, let's combine like terms:y₀² term: -5y₀ terms:(9k -8 +6√5 +10 +6√5) y₀ = (9k +2 +12√5) y₀Constant terms:-2*(9k -8 +6√5) +27h -36 -12√5= -18k +16 -12√5 +27h -36 -12√5= 27h -18k -20 -24√5So, the equation becomes:-5 y₀² + (9k +2 +12√5) y₀ +27h -18k -20 -24√5 = 0Since this equation must hold for all y₀, the coefficients of y₀², y₀, and the constant term must each be zero.So, we have the following system of equations:1. Coefficient of y₀²: -5 = 0 → This is impossible.Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake.Wait, no. Actually, the equation is:-5 y₀² + (9k +2 +12√5) y₀ +27h -18k -20 -24√5 = 0But this must hold for all y₀, which is only possible if the coefficients of y₀², y₀, and the constant term are all zero.But the coefficient of y₀² is -5, which cannot be zero. This suggests that our approach might be flawed.Alternatively, perhaps we made a mistake in the algebra.Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.When we set up the equation:k - [ (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀)/9 ] = [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] [ h - (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)/9 ]Then, multiplied both sides by 9:9k - (8 - 6√5 + 5 y₀) = [ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] * [9h - (12 + 4√5 - 2√5 y₀)]Yes, that's correct.Then, the right side is:[ -3 / (y₀ - 2) ] * [9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀]Yes.So, when we multiplied both sides by (y₀ - 2):(9k -8 +6√5 -5 y₀)(y₀ - 2) = -3*(9h -12 -4√5 + 2√5 y₀)Yes, that's correct.Then, expanding the left side:(9k -8 +6√5)(y₀ - 2) -5 y₀(y₀ - 2)= (9k -8 +6√5)y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5) -5 y₀² +10 y₀Yes.Right side:-3*9h + 3*12 + 3*4√5 - 3*2√5 y₀= -27h +36 +12√5 -6√5 y₀Yes.Bringing all terms to the left:-5 y₀² + [ (9k -8 +6√5) +10 ] y₀ - 2*(9k -8 +6√5) +27h -36 -12√5 +6√5 y₀ = 0Yes.Combining like terms:-5 y₀² + (9k +2 +12√5) y₀ +27h -18k -20 -24√5 = 0Yes.So, the coefficients must be zero:1. Coefficient of y₀²: -5 = 0 → Contradiction.This suggests that our assumption is wrong, or perhaps there is a mistake in the earlier steps.Wait, perhaps the fixed point is independent of y₀, so maybe we can find h and k such that the equation holds for all y₀.But since the coefficient of y₀² is -5, which is non-zero, this suggests that unless the equation is identically zero, which it isn't, there is no such fixed point. But the problem states that AB passes through a fixed point, so there must be a mistake in our approach.Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to find the equation of AB and then finding a fixed point, we can use properties of poles and polars.I recall that the polar line of point P with respect to the circle is the line AB. So, the polar of P is AB, and since P lies on x = 3, the polar line AB will pass through a fixed point.Wait, that might be a better approach.Let me recall that the polar line of a point P(x₀, y₀) with respect to the circle x² + (y - 2)² = 4 is given by:x x₀ + (y - 2)(y₀ - 2) = 4So, for point P(3, y₀), the polar line is:x*3 + (y - 2)(y₀ - 2) = 4Which simplifies to:3x + (y - 2)(y₀ - 2) = 4Now, this is the equation of line AB.We need to find a fixed point (h, k) that lies on this line for any y₀.So, substituting (h, k) into the equation:3h + (k - 2)(y₀ - 2) = 4This must hold for all y₀.So, rearranged:(k - 2)(y₀ - 2) + 3h - 4 = 0Since this must hold for all y₀, the coefficient of y₀ must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero.So,Coefficient of y₀: (k - 2) = 0 → k = 2Constant term: -2(k - 2) + 3h -4 = 0But since k = 2, substitute:-2(0) + 3h -4 = 0 → 3h -4 = 0 → h = 4/3Therefore, the fixed point is (4/3, 2)So, the coordinates of the fixed point are (4/3, 2)**Final Answer**The fixed point is boxed{left( dfrac{4}{3}, 2 right)}."},{"question":"For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister.

In 1990, a typical CPU contained about 500,!000 transistors. According to this law, how many transistors did a typical CPU contain in the year 2010?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of years between 1990 and 2010. Subtracting 1990 from 2010 gives me 20 years.Next, since the number of transistors triples every two years, I'll divide the total number of years by 2 to find out how many tripling periods there are. So, 20 years divided by 2 equals 10 tripling periods.Now, I'll calculate the number of transistors after 10 tripling periods. Starting with 500,000 transistors in 1990, I'll multiply this number by 3 raised to the power of 10. Calculating 3 to the power of 10 gives me 59,049.

If Betty had 60 marbles, how many marbles did Stuart have initially?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many marbles Stuart had initially. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.\\"Betty gave Stuart 40% of her marble collection, and after that, Stuart's collection increased to 80 marbles. If Betty had 60 marbles, how many marbles did Stuart have initially?\\"Alright, so Betty had 60 marbles, and she gave 40% of them to Stuart. After giving those marbles, Stuart's total became 80. I need to find out how many marbles Stuart had before Betty gave him any.First, let me break down the information:1. Betty's total marbles: 602. Percentage given to Stuart: 40%3. Stuart's total after receiving marbles: 80I think I need to find out how many marbles Betty gave to Stuart. Since she gave 40% of her collection, I can calculate that.So, 40% of 60 marbles is... hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle it. To find 40% of 60, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.40% as a decimal is 0.4. So, 0.4 times 60 equals... let me do the multiplication.0.4 * 60 = 24Okay, so Betty gave Stuart 24 marbles. Now, after receiving these 24 marbles, Stuart's total became 80. That means before receiving the marbles, Stuart must have had fewer marbles.To find out how many he had initially, I can subtract the 24 marbles he received from his final total of 80 marbles.So, 80 minus 24 equals... let me calculate that.80 - 24 = 56Therefore, Stuart must have had 56 marbles before Betty gave him any.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If Stuart started with 56 marbles and received 24 from Betty, then his total would be 56 + 24 = 80, which matches the problem statement. Also, 40% of Betty's 60 marbles is indeed 24, so that checks out too.I think I've got it right. Stuart initially had 56 marbles."},{"question":"A car takes 12 hours to cover a distance of 540 km. To cover the same distance in a fraction of the previous time, the speed in kmph should be maintained at 60.

Using the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time, I can calculate the original speed.Next, I know that the car should maintain a speed of 60 km/h to cover the same distance in a fraction of the previous time. Let's denote this fraction as x. Therefore, the new time taken would be 12x hours.Using the speed formula again for the new speed of 60 km/h, I can set up an equation to solve for x. By rearranging the equation, I can isolate x and find its value.Finally, after solving the equation, I will have the fraction of the previous time that the car should maintain to cover the distance at the new speed."},{"question":"Let U={x|x is a positive integer less than 9}, A={1,2,3}, B={3,4,5,6}. Find:<br/>(1)complement _{U}A;<br/>(2)complement _{U}B;<br/>(3)Bcap (complement _{U}A);<br/>(4)Acup (complement _{U}B).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find some complements and intersections and unions of sets. Let me try to understand what each part is asking for.First, the universal set U is defined as all positive integers less than 9. So that should be U = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. Got that down. Then, set A is {1,2,3} and set B is {3,4,5,6}. Cool, so A has the first three numbers and B has numbers from 3 to 6.Now, part (1) is asking for the complement of A with respect to U, which is written as complement_U A. I remember that the complement of a set A is all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. So, to find complement_U A, I need to take all elements in U and remove the ones that are in A.Let me write that out. U is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and A is {1,2,3}. So, removing 1,2,3 from U, what's left? That should be {4,5,6,7,8}. So, complement_U A is {4,5,6,7,8}. That seems straightforward.Moving on to part (2), it's asking for the complement of B with respect to U, which is complement_U B. Using the same logic as before, I need to take all elements in U and remove the ones that are in B. B is {3,4,5,6}, so removing these from U, which is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, leaves me with {1,2,7,8}. So, complement_U B should be {1,2,7,8}. That makes sense.Now, part (3) is a bit more complex: it's asking for the intersection of B and the complement of A. So, B ∩ complement_U A. I need to find elements that are in both B and in complement_U A.From part (1), complement_U A is {4,5,6,7,8}, and B is {3,4,5,6}. So, the intersection would be the elements that are common to both sets. Looking at both sets, the common elements are 4,5,6. So, B ∩ complement_U A is {4,5,6}. That seems right.Finally, part (4) is asking for the union of A and the complement of B, which is A ∪ complement_U B. I need to combine all elements from A and from complement_U B, making sure not to duplicate any elements.From part (2), complement_U B is {1,2,7,8}, and A is {1,2,3}. So, combining these, the union would be {1,2,3,7,8}. Wait, let me double-check that. A has 1,2,3 and complement_U B has 1,2,7,8. So, putting them together, we have 1,2,3,7,8. Yep, that looks correct.Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. complement_U A: U is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, remove A {1,2,3}, so {4,5,6,7,8}. Correct.2. complement_U B: U minus B {3,4,5,6}, so {1,2,7,8}. Correct.3. B ∩ complement_U A: B is {3,4,5,6}, complement_U A is {4,5,6,7,8}, so intersection is {4,5,6}. Correct.4. A ∪ complement_U B: A is {1,2,3}, complement_U B is {1,2,7,8}, so union is {1,2,3,7,8}. Correct.I think I've got all the parts right. Each step follows logically from the definitions of complement, intersection, and union. I didn't skip any steps, and my reasoning seems solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations or logic."},{"question":"In an election, three candidates competed for a position.

Find the lateral surface area of the cone.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the radius of the base of a cone is 3 cm, and the slant height is 10 cm. I need to find the lateral surface area of the cone. Hmm, lateral surface area... I think that's the area of the side of the cone, not including the base. Right?Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about cones. A cone has a circular base, and it tapers smoothly to a point called the apex or the vertex. The radius of the base is given as 3 cm, which is the distance from the center of the base to any point on the edge of the base. The slant height is given as 10 cm. Slant height is the distance from the apex to a point on the edge of the base, measured along the surface of the cone.Now, I need to find the lateral surface area. I remember there's a formula for the lateral surface area of a cone. Let me think... I believe it's something like π times the radius times the slant height. So, in symbols, it would be A = πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height. Yeah, that sounds right.Let me double-check that formula. If I imagine unwrapping the lateral surface of the cone, it forms a sector of a circle. The radius of that sector is the slant height of the cone, and the arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base is 2πr, which is 2π times 3 cm, so that's 6π cm. The area of the sector (which is the lateral surface area) can be calculated as (1/2) times the radius of the sector times the arc length. So, that would be (1/2) * l * (2πr). Simplifying that, the 2s cancel out, and we get πrl. Okay, so the formula is correct.Now, plugging in the values. The radius r is 3 cm, and the slant height l is 10 cm. So, A = π * 3 * 10. Let me calculate that. 3 times 10 is 30, so A = 30π cm². That seems straightforward.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other part of the cone's surface area that I need to consider? The problem specifically asks for the lateral surface area, which is just the side, not including the base. So, I don't need to calculate the area of the circular base, which would be πr². That's good because sometimes people confuse total surface area with lateral surface area.Also, I should confirm that the slant height is indeed 10 cm. Sometimes, problems give the height of the cone instead of the slant height, and you have to calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem. But in this case, the problem directly provides the slant height, so I don't need to worry about that step.Just to recap, the formula for lateral surface area is πrl. Plugging in r = 3 cm and l = 10 cm, we get π * 3 * 10 = 30π cm². That should be the answer.I think I've covered all the bases here. I've recalled the formula, verified it by thinking about the geometry of the cone, double-checked that I'm using the correct values, and made sure I'm answering the specific question about lateral surface area. So, I feel confident that 30π cm² is the correct answer."},{"question":"Find the equation of the line that passes through the origin and also through the intersection point of l_1:x-2y+2=0 and l_2:2x-y-2=0.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the equation of a line that passes through the origin and also goes through the intersection point of two other lines, l₁ and l₂. The equations of these lines are given as l₁: x - 2y + 2 = 0 and l₂: 2x - y - 2 = 0. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that to find the equation of a line, I usually need two things: a point that the line passes through and its slope. In this case, the line we're looking for passes through the origin, which is the point (0, 0). So that's one point. The other point it needs to pass through is the intersection point of l₁ and l₂. So, I need to find where l₁ and l₂ intersect.To find the intersection point of l₁ and l₂, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously. That means finding the values of x and y that satisfy both equations at the same time. So, let's write down the equations again:1. x - 2y + 2 = 02. 2x - y - 2 = 0I can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here because the coefficients are manageable. Let me try that.Looking at the two equations, I notice that if I can make the coefficients of y or x the same in both equations, I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate that variable. Let's try to eliminate y first. In the first equation, the coefficient of y is -2, and in the second equation, it's -1. If I multiply the second equation by 2, then the coefficient of y will become -2, which will match the first equation. Let's do that:Multiply equation 2 by 2:2*(2x - y - 2) = 0Which gives:4x - 2y - 4 = 0Now, our system of equations looks like this:1. x - 2y + 2 = 02. 4x - 2y - 4 = 0Now, if I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, I can eliminate y:(4x - 2y - 4) - (x - 2y + 2) = 0 - 0Let's compute that:4x - 2y - 4 - x + 2y - 2 = 0Simplify like terms:(4x - x) + (-2y + 2y) + (-4 - 2) = 0Which simplifies to:3x + 0y - 6 = 0So, 3x - 6 = 0Now, solve for x:3x = 6x = 6 / 3x = 2Okay, so x is 2. Now, I can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use equation 1 because it looks simpler:x - 2y + 2 = 0Substitute x = 2:2 - 2y + 2 = 0Combine like terms:(2 + 2) - 2y = 04 - 2y = 0Now, solve for y:-2y = -4y = (-4)/(-2)y = 2So, the intersection point of l₁ and l₂ is (2, 2). Great, now I have two points that the desired line passes through: the origin (0, 0) and (2, 2). Now, to find the equation of the line passing through these two points, I can use the slope-intercept form of a line, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through the origin, when x = 0, y = 0. Plugging that into the equation gives 0 = m*0 + b, which simplifies to 0 = 0 + b, so b = 0. That means the equation simplifies to y = mx.Now, I just need to find the slope m. The slope between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is given by m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Using the points (0, 0) and (2, 2), let's compute the slope:m = (2 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 2/2 = 1So, the slope m is 1. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = 1*x + 0, which simplifies to y = x.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the system of equations:1. x - 2y + 2 = 02. 2x - y - 2 = 0I multiplied equation 2 by 2 to get:4x - 2y - 4 = 0Subtracting equation 1 from this gives:3x - 6 = 0 => x = 2Substituting x = 2 into equation 1:2 - 2y + 2 = 0 => 4 - 2y = 0 => y = 2So, the intersection point is indeed (2, 2). Then, the slope between (0, 0) and (2, 2) is (2 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 1. Therefore, the equation is y = x. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me verify if the point (2, 2) lies on the line y = x. Plugging in x = 2, y should be 2, which it is. Also, the origin (0, 0) is on the line y = x because when x = 0, y = 0. So, everything checks out. The equation of the line that passes through the origin and the intersection point of l₁ and l₂ is y = x."},{"question":"Given the quadratic equation in x: x^{2}-(k+4)x+4k=0.  (1) Prove that this equation always has two real roots.  (2) If the equation has one root less than 2, find the range of values for k.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 - (k + 4)x + 4k = 0 ). There are two parts to this problem. The first part asks me to prove that this equation always has two real roots. The second part is about finding the range of values for ( k ) if the equation has one root less than 2. Starting with part (1), I remember that for any quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the discriminant ( Delta ) determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is given by ( Delta = b^2 - 4ac ). If ( Delta > 0 ), there are two distinct real roots; if ( Delta = 0 ), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root); and if ( Delta < 0 ), there are no real roots, meaning the roots are complex.So, for the given equation ( x^2 - (k + 4)x + 4k = 0 ), the coefficients are ( a = 1 ), ( b = -(k + 4) ), and ( c = 4k ). Let me compute the discriminant:[Delta = [-(k + 4)]^2 - 4 times 1 times 4k]Simplifying this:[Delta = (k + 4)^2 - 16k]Expanding ( (k + 4)^2 ):[(k + 4)^2 = k^2 + 8k + 16]So,[Delta = k^2 + 8k + 16 - 16k = k^2 - 8k + 16]Hmm, this simplifies to:[Delta = k^2 - 8k + 16]Wait, this looks like a perfect square. Let me check:[k^2 - 8k + 16 = (k - 4)^2]Yes, that's correct. So, ( Delta = (k - 4)^2 ). Since any square is always non-negative, ( (k - 4)^2 geq 0 ) for all real numbers ( k ). Therefore, the discriminant is always non-negative, which means the quadratic equation always has two real roots (they could be equal if ( Delta = 0 ), but they are still real). So, part (1) is proven.Moving on to part (2): If the equation has one root less than 2, find the range of values for ( k ).First, let's recall that a quadratic equation has two roots. If one root is less than 2, the other root could be either greater than or equal to 2. But since the problem specifies that one root is less than 2, we need to find the values of ( k ) for which this condition holds.One approach is to factor the quadratic equation if possible. Let me try factoring ( x^2 - (k + 4)x + 4k ).Looking for two numbers that multiply to ( 4k ) and add up to ( -(k + 4) ). Hmm, let's see:The equation is ( x^2 - (k + 4)x + 4k ). Let me rewrite it:[x^2 - (k + 4)x + 4k = 0]I can try to factor this as ( (x - a)(x - b) = 0 ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the roots. Then, ( a + b = k + 4 ) and ( ab = 4k ).Let me see if I can find such ( a ) and ( b ). Let's assume ( a = 4 ) and ( b = k ). Then:( a + b = 4 + k ), which is equal to ( k + 4 ), which matches the coefficient. Also, ( ab = 4k ), which matches the constant term. So, yes, the equation factors as:[(x - 4)(x - k) = 0]Therefore, the roots are ( x = 4 ) and ( x = k ).So, the two roots are 4 and ( k ). Now, the problem states that one root is less than 2. Since one of the roots is 4, which is greater than 2, the other root must be less than 2. Therefore, the root ( x = k ) must be less than 2.So, we have:[k < 2]Therefore, the range of values for ( k ) is all real numbers less than 2.Wait, let me double-check. If ( k < 2 ), then one root is ( k ) which is less than 2, and the other root is 4, which is greater than 2. That satisfies the condition that one root is less than 2.Is there any other condition I need to consider? For example, could both roots be less than 2? But since one root is 4, which is fixed, it can't be less than 2. So, only ( k ) can be less than 2.Therefore, the range of ( k ) is ( k < 2 ).I think that's it. So, summarizing:1. The discriminant is always non-negative, so the equation always has two real roots.2. For the equation to have one root less than 2, ( k ) must be less than 2."},{"question":"Given sets A={x|x^{2}-2x-3 lt 0} and B={x|2^{x-2} gt 1}, then Acap (complement _{R}B)=left(  right)A: {xleft|right.1 lt xleqslant 2}B: {xleft|right.2leqslant x lt 3}C: {xleft|right.-1 lt xleqslant 2}D: {xleft|right.1 lt x lt 3}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two sets, A and B, and I need to find the intersection of A with the complement of B in the real numbers. Hmm, let me take it step by step.First, let's figure out what set A is. The definition of A is all real numbers x such that x squared minus 2x minus 3 is less than zero. So, I need to solve the inequality x² - 2x - 3 < 0. I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, it's helpful to factor them if possible.Let me try factoring x² - 2x - 3. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1, right? So, the factored form should be (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0. Okay, so the product of (x - 3) and (x + 1) is less than zero. To find where this product is negative, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are x = -1 and x = 3. So, the number line is divided into three intervals: less than -1, between -1 and 3, and greater than 3. Testing a value in each interval:- For x < -1, say x = -2: (-2 - 3)(-2 + 1) = (-5)(-1) = 5, which is positive.- For -1 < x < 3, say x = 0: (0 - 3)(0 + 1) = (-3)(1) = -3, which is negative.- For x > 3, say x = 4: (4 - 3)(4 + 1) = (1)(5) = 5, which is positive.Since we're looking for where the product is less than zero, that's the interval where it's negative, which is between -1 and 3. So, set A is (-1, 3). Got that.Now, moving on to set B. The definition of B is all real numbers x such that 2^(x - 2) is greater than 1. Okay, so 2 raised to some power is greater than 1. I know that 2^0 = 1, and since 2 is a positive number greater than 1, the function 2^y increases as y increases. So, 2^y > 1 when y > 0.In this case, y is (x - 2). So, 2^(x - 2) > 1 implies that (x - 2) > 0. Solving for x, we get x > 2. So, set B is (2, ∞). That seems straightforward.Now, the problem asks for A intersected with the complement of B in the real numbers. So, first, I need to find the complement of B in R. The complement of B would be all real numbers not in B. Since B is (2, ∞), its complement is (-∞, 2]. So, complement of B is (-∞, 2].Now, I need to find the intersection of A and the complement of B. Set A is (-1, 3), and the complement of B is (-∞, 2]. The intersection of these two sets would be the overlap between them. So, let's visualize this.Set A is from -1 to 3, and the complement of B is everything up to 2. So, overlapping these, the intersection would be from -1 up to 2. But wait, set A starts at -1, and the complement of B goes up to 2, so the intersection is (-1, 2]. Let me double-check that. So, A is (-1, 3), and complement of B is (-∞, 2]. The intersection is all x such that x is greater than -1 and less than or equal to 2. So, yes, that's (-1, 2].Looking back at the options given:A: {x | 1 < x ≤ 2}B: {x | 2 ≤ x < 3}C: {x | -1 < x ≤ 2}D: {x | 1 < x < 3}So, the set we found is {x | -1 < x ≤ 2}, which is option C. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Wait, in the original problem, set A is defined by x² - 2x - 3 < 0, which we solved as (-1, 3). Set B is x | 2^(x - 2) > 1, which is (2, ∞). So, the complement of B is (-∞, 2]. Therefore, the intersection of A and complement of B is (-1, 3) intersected with (-∞, 2], which is indeed (-1, 2]. So, yes, option C is correct. But just to be thorough, let me check if I interpreted the inequalities correctly. For set A, x² - 2x - 3 < 0, which factors to (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0. The solution is between -1 and 3, which is correct. For set B, 2^(x - 2) > 1, which simplifies to x - 2 > 0, so x > 2, correct. Therefore, the complement of B is everything less than or equal to 2, and intersecting that with A gives us (-1, 2]. So, option C is the right answer."},{"question":"Part of the graph of   f(x) equal{} x^3 plus{} bx^2 plus{} cx plus{} d  is shown.

First, I remember that the roots of a polynomial function are the x-values where the function crosses the x-axis. So, seeing the points ((-1, 0)) and ((1, 0)) tells me that ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 1 ) are roots of the function.

Let me try that.Starting with the factored form:[f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x - r)]First, I'll multiply ( (x + 1)(x - 1) ) which is a difference of squares:[(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1]So now, the function becomes:[f(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x - r)]Next, I'll distribute ( (x^2 - 1) ) over ( (x - r) ):[f(x) = x^3 - r x^2 - x + r]So, expanding it out, I have:[f(x) = x^3 - r x^2 - x + r]Now, comparing this to the general form ( f(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ), I can match the coefficients:- The coefficient of ( x^3 ) is 1 in both, so that's consistent.- The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is ( -r ) in the expanded form and ( b ) in the general form. So, ( b = -r ).- The coefficient of ( x ) is ( -1 ) in the expanded form and ( c ) in the general form. So, ( c = -1 ).- The constant term is ( r ) in the expanded form and ( d ) in the general form. So, ( d = r ).Okay, so now I have expressions for ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ) in terms of ( r ). But I need to find ( b ), so I need to figure out what ( r ) is. Looking back at the graph, I notice another point: ( (0, 2) ). This is the y-intercept of the function because it's where ( x = 0 ). The y-intercept occurs when ( x = 0 ), so plugging that into the function:[f(0) = (0)^3 + b(0)^2 + c(0) + d = d]But from the point ( (0, 2) ), we know ( f(0) = 2 ), so ( d = 2 ).Earlier, I found that ( d = r ), so ( r = 2 ). Now, going back to the expression for ( b ), which is ( b = -r ), and since ( r = 2 ), this gives:[b = -2]Wait, let me double-check that. If ( r = 2 ), then the function is ( f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 2) ). Let me expand this to make sure it matches the general form.First, multiply ( (x + 1)(x - 1) ) as before:[(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1]Then, multiply by ( (x - 2) ):[(x^2 - 1)(x - 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2]So, the expanded form is:[f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2]Comparing this to ( f(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ), we can see that:- ( b = -2 )- ( c = -1 )- ( d = 2 )Yes, that matches. So, ( b = -2 ) is correct.I think that's it. I used the given points to factor the polynomial, expanded it, and compared coefficients to find ( b ). It all checks out.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"From a pack of some cards, two cards are drawn together at random. The probability of one being a spade and one being a heart is 0.12745098039215685. How many cards are in the pack?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of cards in the pack, denoted as ( N ). In a standard deck, there are four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, each containing ( frac{N}{4} ) cards.When two cards are drawn at random, the total number of possible combinations is given by the combination formula ( C(N, 2) ), which simplifies to ( frac{N(N-1)}{2} ).The number of ways to draw one spade and one heart is the product of the number of spades and hearts, which is ( frac{N}{4} times frac{N}{4} ).The probability of drawing one spade and one heart is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:[frac{frac{N}{4} times frac{N}{4}}{frac{N(N-1)}{2}} = 0.12745098039215685]Simplifying the equation:[frac{N^2}{16} div frac{N(N-1)}{2} = 0.12745098039215685][frac{N^2}{8} = 0.12745098039215685 times N(N-1)][N^2 = 1.0196078431372548 times N(N-1)]Dividing both sides by ( N ):[N = 1.0196078431372548 times (N-1)][N = 1.0196078431372548N - 1.0196078431372548][N - 1.0196078431372548N = -1.0196078431372548][-0.0196078431372548N = -1.0196078431372548][N = frac{-1.0196078431372548}{-0.0196078431372548}][N = 52]Therefore, the total number of cards in the pack is 52."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate plane, the set excluding the two points A(1,1) and B(2,-2) can be represented as ( ).A: {left(x,yright)left|right.xneq 1,yneq 1,xneq 2,yneq -2}B: {left(x,yright)|left{begin{array}{l}x≠1 y≠1end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}x≠2 y≠-2end{array}right.}C: {left(x,yright)|[left(x-1right)^{2}+left(y-1right)^{2}][left(x-2right)^{2}+left(y+2right)^{2}]neq 0}D: {left(x,yright)|[left(x-1right)^{2}+left(y-1right)^{2}]+[left(x-2right)^{2}+left(y+2right)^{2}]neq 0}","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about representing a set in the Cartesian coordinate plane that excludes two specific points, A(1,1) and B(2,-2). There are four options given, labeled A through D. I need to figure out which one correctly represents the set excluding just these two points.First, let me understand what the question is asking. It's about excluding two points from the entire plane. So, the set should include all points except A and B. That means any point (x,y) in the plane, except when (x,y) is exactly (1,1) or (2,-2).Looking at the options, they all define sets with certain conditions. I need to analyze each condition to see if it correctly excludes only those two points.Starting with **Option A**: It says { (x,y) | x ≠ 1, y ≠ 1, x ≠ 2, y ≠ -2 }. So, this set includes all points where x is not 1, y is not 1, x is not 2, and y is not -2. Hmm, this seems like it's excluding more than just the two points. If x ≠ 1 and x ≠ 2, that excludes all points where x is 1 or 2, which are entire vertical lines. Similarly, y ≠ 1 and y ≠ -2 excludes entire horizontal lines. So, this set is excluding four lines, not just two points. That's way too much. So, Option A is not correct.Moving on to **Option B**: It says { (x,y) | { x ≠ 1; y ≠ 1 } or { x ≠ 2; y ≠ -2 } }. This is a bit confusingly written, but it seems to be saying that either x is not 1 and y is not 1, or x is not 2 and y is not -2. Wait, so if I interpret this correctly, it's saying that for a point to be in the set, it needs to satisfy either the first condition (x ≠ 1 and y ≠ 1) or the second condition (x ≠ 2 and y ≠ -2). But actually, this is a bit tricky. Because if a point satisfies either of these, it means that it's not both (1,1) or (2,-2). But actually, no, because if a point is (1,2), it satisfies x ≠ 2 and y ≠ -2, so it would be included. Similarly, a point like (3,1) would satisfy x ≠ 1 and y ≠ -2, so it would also be included. Wait, but actually, this might not be excluding just the two points. Let me think again.If I consider the logical \\"or\\" here, it's saying that as long as a point is not (1,1) or not (2,-2), it's included. But actually, that's not quite right. Because the way it's written, it's two separate conditions connected by \\"or.\\" So, if a point is not (1,1), it's included, or if it's not (2,-2), it's included. But actually, all points except (1,1) and (2,-2) would satisfy at least one of these conditions. Wait, is that true?Let me test it. Take the point (1,1). For this point, x = 1 and y = 1, so x ≠ 1 is false and y ≠ 1 is false. Similarly, x ≠ 2 is true and y ≠ -2 is true, so the second condition is true. Wait, so (1,1) would satisfy the second condition because x ≠ 2 and y ≠ -2 are both true. So, (1,1) would actually be included in the set, which is not what we want. Similarly, (2,-2) would satisfy the first condition because x ≠ 1 and y ≠ 1 are both true, so it would also be included. That's the opposite of what we need. So, Option B is incorrect because it includes the points we want to exclude.Now, **Option C**: It says { (x,y) | [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2][(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2] ≠ 0 }. Okay, this looks like a product of two expressions. Let me break it down. The first part, (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2, is the square of the distance from the point (x,y) to the point A(1,1). Similarly, the second part, (x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2, is the square of the distance from (x,y) to B(2,-2). So, the product of these two distances squared is not equal to zero.When would this product be zero? It would be zero only if either of the distances is zero, meaning if (x,y) is exactly A or exactly B. So, if we exclude points where this product is zero, we're excluding exactly A and B. Therefore, this set includes all points except A and B, which is exactly what we need. So, Option C seems correct.But let me check **Option D** just to be thorough. It says { (x,y) | [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2] + [(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2] ≠ 0 }. This is the sum of the squared distances from (x,y) to A and to B. When would this sum be zero? Well, each squared distance is always non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is zero only if both are zero. So, this sum is zero only if both (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 0 and (x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 0. But that would require (x,y) to be both A and B simultaneously, which is impossible. So, actually, this sum is never zero for any point in the plane. Therefore, the condition [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2] + [(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2] ≠ 0 is always true, meaning the set includes all points in the plane. That's not what we want because we need to exclude A and B. So, Option D is incorrect.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check Option D. If the sum is never zero, then the condition is always true, so the set is the entire plane. That means it doesn't exclude anything, which is definitely not what we want. So, Option D is out.Going back to Option C, it's clear that it correctly excludes only A and B because the product of the distances is zero only at those points. So, Option C is the correct representation.Just to recap:- Option A excludes entire lines, which is too much.- Option B incorrectly includes the points we want to exclude.- Option C correctly excludes only A and B.- Option D doesn't exclude anything because the sum is always non-zero.Therefore, the correct answer is Option C."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If overrightarrow{OB} = a_1 overrightarrow{OA} + a_{200} overrightarrow{OC}, and points A, B, C are collinear (the line does not pass through the origin O), then S_{200}= _____A: 100B: 101C: 200D: 201","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about an arithmetic sequence and some vectors. Let me try to unpack it step by step.First, the problem says: Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n. Then, it gives a vector equation: vector OB equals a1 times vector OA plus a200 times vector OC. Also, points A, B, C are collinear, and the line doesn't pass through the origin O. We need to find S200, which is the sum of the first 200 terms of the arithmetic sequence.Okay, so let's break this down. I know that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus a common difference. So, a_n = a1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * (a1 + a_n). That's the formula I remember.Now, the vector part: vector OB = a1 * vector OA + a200 * vector OC. Hmm, vectors OA, OB, and OC. Points A, B, C are collinear, so they lie on the same straight line. Also, the line doesn't pass through the origin O. So, O is not on that line.I remember that if three points are collinear, the vectors representing them can be expressed as a linear combination where the coefficients add up to 1. So, if vector OB = k * vector OA + m * vector OC, then k + m = 1. Is that right? Let me think. Yeah, that makes sense because if you have two points on a line, any other point on the line can be expressed as a weighted average of those two points, and the weights should add up to 1.So, in this case, vector OB is expressed as a1 * vector OA + a200 * vector OC. Therefore, the coefficients a1 and a200 must add up to 1. That gives us the equation a1 + a200 = 1.Okay, so that's one equation. Now, since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, we can express a200 in terms of a1 and the common difference d. As I mentioned earlier, a_n = a1 + (n-1)d. So, a200 = a1 + (200 - 1)d = a1 + 199d.So, substituting back into the equation a1 + a200 = 1, we get:a1 + (a1 + 199d) = 1Simplify that:2a1 + 199d = 1Hmm, so that's one equation with two variables, a1 and d. I need another equation to solve for both, but I don't have any more information. Wait, maybe I don't need to find a1 and d individually. The question is asking for S200, the sum of the first 200 terms.Let me recall the formula for S_n: S_n = n/2 * (a1 + a_n). So, S200 = 200/2 * (a1 + a200) = 100 * (a1 + a200). But from earlier, we have a1 + a200 = 1. So, substituting that in, S200 = 100 * 1 = 100.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is the answer 100? Let me double-check.We have vector OB = a1 OA + a200 OC, and since A, B, C are collinear, the coefficients must add to 1. So, a1 + a200 = 1. Then, the sum S200 is 100*(a1 + a200) = 100*1 = 100. That seems correct.But let me think again if I missed something. The problem mentions that the line does not pass through the origin O. Does that affect anything? Hmm, if the line passes through O, then O would be a point on the line, but since it doesn't, O is not on the line. So, does that change the fact that the coefficients add to 1? I don't think so because the collinearity condition is about the points A, B, C, not about the origin. So, the condition a1 + a200 = 1 still holds.Another thing to consider: is the arithmetic sequence starting at n=1? Yes, because it's given as {a_n}, so a1 is the first term, a2 is the second, and so on. So, a200 is the 200th term.So, putting it all together, since a1 + a200 = 1, the sum S200 is 100*(1) = 100. So, the answer should be 100, which is option A.Wait, just to make sure, let me think about the vector equation again. Vector OB is a linear combination of vectors OA and OC. If A, B, C are collinear, then B lies on the line AC. So, vector OB can be expressed as a linear combination of OA and OC with coefficients adding to 1. That's the affine combination concept. So, that's why a1 + a200 = 1.Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think my reasoning is solid. Therefore, S200 is 100.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Compute (i^{603} + i^{602} + cdots + i + 1), where (i^2 = -1).","answer":"First, I need to understand the pattern of the powers of (i). I know that (i^2 = -1), and by calculating higher powers, I can observe that the powers of (i) repeat every four terms: (i^1 = i), (i^2 = -1), (i^3 = -i), and (i^4 = 1).Next, I notice that the series (i^{603} + i^{602} + cdots + i + 1) can be broken down into groups of four terms each, since the pattern repeats every four powers. This means that from (i^1) to (i^{600}), there are 150 complete groups of four terms.Each group of four terms sums up to zero: (i + (-1) + (-i) + 1 = 0). Therefore, the sum of all 150 groups is (150 times 0 = 0).Now, I need to handle the remaining terms (i^{601}), (i^{602}), and (i^{603}) separately. Calculating these:- (i^{601} = i)- (i^{602} = -1)- (i^{603} = -i)Adding these together: (i + (-1) + (-i) = -1).Finally, I include the constant term (1) at the end of the series. Adding this to the previous result: (-1 + 1 = 0).Therefore, the total sum of the series is zero."},{"question":"The vertex of the parabola described by the equation y=-3x^2-30x-81 is (m,n). What is n?","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation of a parabola: y equals negative three x squared minus thirty x minus eighty-one. I need to find the vertex, which is given as (m, n), and specifically, I need to figure out what n is. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that the vertex form of a parabola is useful for identifying the vertex directly. The standard form is y equals a times (x minus h) squared plus k, where (h, k) is the vertex. So, I think I need to convert the given equation into this vertex form.First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: y equals negative three x squared minus thirty x minus eighty-one. Alright, so it's a quadratic equation in standard form, which is y equals ax squared plus bx plus c. In this case, a is negative three, b is negative thirty, and c is negative eighty-one.I recall that one way to find the vertex is by completing the square. Completing the square can help me rewrite the quadratic in vertex form. Let me try that. So, starting with the equation:y = -3x² - 30x - 81I think the first step is to factor out the coefficient of x squared from the first two terms. That would be factoring out negative three from the x squared and x terms. Let me do that:y = -3(x² + 10x) - 81Wait, let me check that. If I factor out negative three from -3x², I get x squared, and from -30x, I get plus ten x, right? So, yes, that looks correct. So now, inside the parentheses, I have x squared plus ten x, and then I have minus eighty-one outside.Now, to complete the square, I need to take the coefficient of x, which is ten, divide it by two to get five, and then square that to get twenty-five. So, I need to add and subtract twenty-five inside the parentheses to complete the square. But wait, since I'm adding twenty-five inside the parentheses, and there's a factor of negative three outside, I have to remember that adding twenty-five inside is actually adding negative three times twenty-five, which is negative seventy-five. So, I need to balance that by adding seventy-five outside to keep the equation equivalent.Let me write that down step by step:y = -3(x² + 10x) - 81To complete the square, add and subtract (10/2)² = 25 inside the parentheses:y = -3[(x² + 10x + 25 - 25)] - 81This simplifies to:y = -3[(x + 5)² - 25] - 81Now, distribute the negative three across the terms inside the brackets:y = -3(x + 5)² + 75 - 81Combine the constants:75 minus 81 is negative six, so:y = -3(x + 5)² - 6Now, this is in vertex form, where the vertex is at (h, k). In this case, h is negative five because it's x plus five, which is x minus (-5), and k is negative six. So, the vertex is at (-5, -6). Therefore, n, which is the y-coordinate of the vertex, is negative six.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation, factoring out negative three correctly, completing the square by adding and subtracting twenty-five, distributing the negative three, and then combining the constants. Yeah, that seems right. So, the vertex is indeed at (-5, -6), so n is -6.Alternatively, I remember there's a formula to find the vertex directly from the standard form without completing the square. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a). Let me try that method to confirm.Given the equation y = -3x² - 30x - 81, a is -3, b is -30. So, plugging into the formula:m = -b/(2a) = -(-30)/(2*(-3)) = 30/(-6) = -5So, m is -5, which matches what I found earlier. Now, to find n, which is the y-coordinate, I can plug m back into the original equation.So, n = y = -3(-5)² - 30*(-5) - 81Calculating each term:-3*(-5)² = -3*(25) = -75-30*(-5) = 150So, adding them up:-75 + 150 - 81 = (75) - 81 = -6Yes, that confirms it. So, n is indeed -6.I think both methods lead me to the same answer, so I'm confident that n is -6."},{"question":"The base of a triangular field is three times its altitude.

The sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. There are four statements, A to D, and I need to figure out which ones are correct. Let me take them one by one.Starting with Statement A: It says that a over sin A equals (a + b + c) over (sin A + sin B + sin C). Hmm, I remember something about the Law of Sines. It states that in any triangle, a over sin A equals b over sin B equals c over sin C. So, if all these ratios are equal, then adding them up should maintain the proportion, right? So, if a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C, then adding the numerators and denominators should still keep the equality. That means (a + b + c)/(sin A + sin B + sin C) should also equal a/sin A. So, I think Statement A is correct.Moving on to Statement B: It says that if triangle ABC is an oblique triangle, then tan A + tan B + tan C equals tan A tan B tan C. An oblique triangle is just a triangle that isn't right-angled, so all angles are either acute or obtuse. I recall that in any triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees, so A + B + C = π radians. There's a trigonometric identity that says tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C when A + B + C = π. Since in an oblique triangle, this condition holds, Statement B should be correct too.Now, Statement C: If the dot product of vectors AC and CB is greater than zero, then triangle ABC is an acute triangle. Let me think about vectors. The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them. So, AC · CB = |AC||CB|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between vectors AC and CB. But in triangle ABC, the angle at point C is between sides AC and CB. Wait, actually, vectors AC and CB are going from C to A and from C to B, so the angle between them is actually the angle at C, which is angle C. But the dot product formula uses the angle between the vectors, which in this case is angle C. So, AC · CB = |AC||CB|cos(angle C). But the problem says AC · CB > 0. That would mean that cos(angle C) > 0, which implies that angle C is acute because cosine is positive in the first quadrant (0 to 90 degrees). However, just because angle C is acute doesn't necessarily mean the entire triangle is acute. The other angles could still be right or obtuse. So, this statement might not necessarily be true. I think Statement C is incorrect.Finally, Statement D: If a over cos A equals b over cos B equals c over cos C, then triangle ABC is definitely an equilateral triangle. Let me unpack this. If a/cos A = b/cos B = c/cos C, then all these ratios are equal. Let's denote this common ratio as k. So, a = k cos A, b = k cos B, c = k cos C. From the Law of Sines, we know that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. So, if a = k cos A and a = (k cos A) = (k sin A)/sin A * sin A, wait, maybe I should relate a and b differently. If a = k cos A and a = (some multiple) sin A, then perhaps we can set up equations.Alternatively, since a = k cos A and a = (from Law of Sines) 2R sin A, where R is the circumradius. So, 2R sin A = k cos A, which implies tan A = k/(2R). Similarly, tan B = k/(2R) and tan C = k/(2R). So, tan A = tan B = tan C. Since all angles are between 0 and π, and their sum is π, the only way their tangents are equal is if all angles are equal, meaning each angle is 60 degrees. Therefore, the triangle must be equilateral. So, Statement D is correct.Wait, but let me double-check Statement C. If the dot product is positive, angle C is acute, but does that make the whole triangle acute? Suppose angle C is acute, but angles A or B could be obtuse. For example, in a triangle with angles 100, 40, 40 degrees, angle C is 40, which is acute, but the triangle is obtuse because of angle A.

Hmm, okay.First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio, r. So, if the first term is a, then the sequence goes a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, and so on. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), right? Or if r is 1, it's just S_n = a*n. But since they're giving me S_2 and S_4, I can probably set up some equations to solve for a and r.Let me write down the given information:S_2 = 3S_4 = 15So, using the sum formula:For S_2: a(1 - r^2)/(1 - r) = 3For S_4: a(1 - r^4)/(1 - r) = 15Hmm, okay. So I have two equations here with two variables, a and r. Maybe I can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate a. Let's try that.Divide S_4 by S_2:[a(1 - r^4)/(1 - r)] / [a(1 - r^2)/(1 - r)] = 15/3Simplify this:(1 - r^4)/(1 - r^2) = 5Hmm, I can factor the numerator:1 - r^4 = (1 - r^2)(1 + r^2)So, substituting that in:(1 - r^2)(1 + r^2)/(1 - r^2) = 5The (1 - r^2) terms cancel out, assuming r ≠ 1, which makes sense because if r were 1, the sum would just be 2a = 3, so a = 1.5, and S_4 would be 4a = 6, but they say S_4 is 15, so r can't be 1. So, we're safe to cancel.So, we get:1 + r^2 = 5Therefore, r^2 = 4, so r = 2 or r = -2.Okay, so r is either 2 or -2. Let's consider both possibilities.First, let's take r = 2.Then, from S_2 = 3:a(1 - 2^2)/(1 - 2) = 3Simplify numerator and denominator:a(1 - 4)/(-1) = 3a(-3)/(-1) = 3a*3 = 3So, a = 1.Okay, so if r = 2, then a = 1.Let me check S_4 with these values:S_4 = 1*(1 - 2^4)/(1 - 2) = (1 - 16)/(-1) = (-15)/(-1) = 15. Perfect, that matches.Now, let's check r = -2.From S_2 = 3:a(1 - (-2)^2)/(1 - (-2)) = 3Simplify numerator and denominator:a(1 - 4)/(1 + 2) = 3a*(-3)/3 = 3a*(-1) = 3So, a = -3.Let me check S_4 with a = -3 and r = -2:S_4 = -3*(1 - (-2)^4)/(1 - (-2)) = -3*(1 - 16)/(1 + 2) = -3*(-15)/3 = (-3)*(-5) = 15. That also works.So, we have two possibilities: either a = 1 and r = 2, or a = -3 and r = -2.Now, we need to find S_6. Let's compute it for both cases.First case: a = 1, r = 2.S_6 = 1*(1 - 2^6)/(1 - 2) = (1 - 64)/(-1) = (-63)/(-1) = 63.Second case: a = -3, r = -2.S_6 = -3*(1 - (-2)^6)/(1 - (-2)) = -3*(1 - 64)/(1 + 2) = -3*(-63)/3 = (-3)*(-21) = 63.Wow, both cases give S_6 = 63. So regardless of whether r is 2 or -2, S_6 is 63.So, the answer is 63.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_6 ) is boxed{63}."},{"question":"How many positive integers n less than 200 have a corresponding integer m divisible by 4 such that the roots of x^2-nx+m=0 are consecutive even integers?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: \\"How many positive integers ( n ) less than 200 have a corresponding integer ( m ) divisible by 4 such that the roots of ( x^2 - nx + m = 0 ) are consecutive even integers?\\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that for a quadratic equation ( x^2 - nx + m = 0 ), the sum of the roots is ( n ) and the product of the roots is ( m ). That's from Vieta's formulas, right? So if the roots are consecutive even integers, I can represent them as ( 2k ) and ( 2k + 2 ) where ( k ) is an integer. That makes sense because consecutive even integers differ by 2.So, let's denote the roots as ( 2k ) and ( 2k + 2 ). Then, according to Vieta's formulas:1. **Sum of the roots**: ( 2k + (2k + 2) = 4k + 2 ). This sum should equal ( n ). So, ( n = 4k + 2 ).2. **Product of the roots**: ( 2k times (2k + 2) = 4k^2 + 4k ). This product should equal ( m ). So, ( m = 4k^2 + 4k ).Now, the problem states that ( m ) must be divisible by 4. Looking at the expression for ( m ), which is ( 4k^2 + 4k ), I can factor out a 4: ( m = 4(k^2 + k) ). Since ( k^2 + k ) is an integer (because ( k ) is an integer), ( m ) is indeed divisible by 4. So, that condition is automatically satisfied for any integer ( k ).Next, I need to find how many positive integers ( n ) less than 200 satisfy this condition. From the sum of the roots, we have ( n = 4k + 2 ). So, I need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( n < 200 ) and ( n = 4k + 2 ) for some integer ( k ).Let me solve for ( k ) in terms of ( n ):( n = 4k + 2 )Subtract 2 from both sides:( n - 2 = 4k )Divide both sides by 4:( k = frac{n - 2}{4} )Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( n - 2 ) must be divisible by 4. In other words, ( n ) must be congruent to 2 modulo 4. So, ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} ).Now, I need to find all positive integers ( n ) less than 200 that satisfy ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} ). These numbers form an arithmetic sequence starting from 2, with a common difference of 4: 2, 6, 10, 14, ..., up to the largest number less than 200.To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d )Where:- ( a_n ) is the nth term,- ( a_1 ) is the first term,- ( d ) is the common difference,- ( n ) is the number of terms.In this case:- ( a_1 = 2 ),- ( d = 4 ),- ( a_n < 200 ).Plugging in the values:( 2 + (n - 1) times 4 < 200 )Simplify:( 2 + 4n - 4 < 200 )Combine like terms:( 4n - 2 < 200 )Add 2 to both sides:( 4n < 202 )Divide both sides by 4:( n < 50.5 )Since ( n ) must be an integer, the largest possible value for ( n ) is 50. Therefore, there are 50 terms in this sequence.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If ( n = 50 ), then ( a_n = 2 + (50 - 1) times 4 = 2 + 49 times 4 = 2 + 196 = 198 ), which is indeed less than 200. If ( n = 51 ), then ( a_n = 2 + 50 times 4 = 2 + 200 = 202 ), which is greater than 200. So, yes, 50 terms.But wait, let's think about ( k ). Earlier, I had ( k = frac{n - 2}{4} ). So, ( k ) must also be an integer. Since ( n ) is positive, ( k ) can be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to some maximum value.From ( n = 4k + 2 < 200 ), we have:( 4k + 2 < 200 )Subtract 2:( 4k < 198 )Divide by 4:( k < 49.5 )Since ( k ) must be an integer, the maximum value ( k ) can take is 49. Therefore, ( k ) can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 49, which is 50 values in total.So, that confirms it. There are 50 possible values of ( k ), each corresponding to a unique ( n ) less than 200, where ( m ) is divisible by 4 and the roots are consecutive even integers.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let's recap:1. The roots are consecutive even integers: ( 2k ) and ( 2k + 2 ).2. Sum of roots: ( 4k + 2 = n ).3. Product of roots: ( 4k^2 + 4k = m ), which is divisible by 4.4. ( n < 200 ) implies ( k < 49.5 ), so ( k ) can be 0 to 49.5. Therefore, 50 possible values of ( n ).Yes, that all adds up. I think I've covered all the bases here. So, the final answer should be 50.**Final Answer**The number of positive integers ( n ) less than 200 is boxed{50}."},{"question":"Find the relationship between arcsin(cos(arcsin(x))) and arccos(sin(arccos(x))).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the relationship between two expressions: arcsin(cos(arcsin(x))) and arccos(sin(arccos(x))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, let me try to understand what each part means. Starting with arcsin(x). I know that arcsin(x) gives me an angle whose sine is x. The range of arcsin(x) is from -π/2 to π/2, but since we're dealing with cosine and sine functions, which are positive in certain quadrants, maybe I can assume x is between -1 and 1, which is the domain for both arcsin and arccos.So, let's define α = arcsin(cos(arcsin(x))). Let me write that down:α = arcsin(cos(arcsin(x)))Since α is the arcsin of something, it must be between -π/2 and π/2. But since cosine of any angle is between -1 and 1, and arcsin(x) is between -π/2 and π/2, cos(arcsin(x)) will be between 0 and 1 because cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, which correspond to the range of arcsin(x). So, cos(arcsin(x)) is between 0 and 1, meaning α is between 0 and π/2.Similarly, let's define β = arccos(sin(arccos(x))). So,β = arccos(sin(arccos(x)))Since β is the arccos of something, it must be between 0 and π. But sin(arccos(x)) is between 0 and 1 because arccos(x) is between 0 and π, and sine is positive in the first and second quadrants. So, sin(arccos(x)) is between 0 and 1, meaning β is between 0 and π/2.Now, I need to find the relationship between α and β. Maybe I can express both in terms of x and then see if they add up to something or subtract to something.Starting with α:α = arcsin(cos(arcsin(x)))Let me let θ = arcsin(x). Then, x = sin(θ), and θ is between -π/2 and π/2. Then, cos(arcsin(x)) becomes cos(θ). So,α = arcsin(cos(θ)) = arcsin(√(1 - sin²θ)) because cos(θ) = √(1 - sin²θ) when θ is in the first or fourth quadrant.But since θ is between -π/2 and π/2, cos(θ) is positive, so we can write:α = arcsin(√(1 - x²))Similarly, for β:β = arccos(sin(arccos(x)))Let me let φ = arccos(x). Then, x = cos(φ), and φ is between 0 and π. Then, sin(arccos(x)) becomes sin(φ). So,β = arccos(sin(φ)) = arccos(√(1 - cos²φ)) because sin(φ) = √(1 - cos²φ) when φ is between 0 and π.But since φ is between 0 and π, sin(φ) is non-negative, so we can write:β = arccos(√(1 - x²))Now, I have:α = arcsin(√(1 - x²))β = arccos(√(1 - x²))I need to find the relationship between α and β. Let me consider that both α and β are functions of √(1 - x²). Maybe I can relate them through a trigonometric identity.I know that arcsin(z) + arccos(z) = π/2 for any z between -1 and 1. Let me check if that applies here.If I let z = √(1 - x²), then:arcsin(z) + arccos(z) = π/2But in our case, α = arcsin(z) and β = arccos(z). So,α + β = π/2Wow, that seems to be the relationship! Let me verify this with an example to make sure.Let's take x = 0. Then,arcsin(0) = 0, so cos(arcsin(0)) = cos(0) = 1, and arcsin(1) = π/2.On the other hand, arccos(0) = π/2, so sin(arccos(0)) = sin(π/2) = 1, and arccos(1) = 0.So, α = π/2 and β = 0. Their sum is π/2, which matches our conclusion.Another example: x = 1/2.arcsin(1/2) = π/6, so cos(π/6) = √3/2, and arcsin(√3/2) = π/3.arccos(1/2) = π/3, so sin(π/3) = √3/2, and arccos(√3/2) = π/6.So, α = π/3 and β = π/6. Their sum is π/2, which again matches.One more example: x = √2/2.arcsin(√2/2) = π/4, so cos(π/4) = √2/2, and arcsin(√2/2) = π/4.arccos(√2/2) = π/4, so sin(π/4) = √2/2, and arccos(√2/2) = π/4.So, α = π/4 and β = π/4. Their sum is π/2, which still holds.Okay, it seems consistent across different values. Therefore, the relationship between α and β is that their sum is π/2."},{"question":"Let [f(x) = left{begin{array}{cl}2x + 7 & text{if } x < -2, -x^2 - x + 1 & text{if } x ge -2.end{array}right.]Find the sum of all values of x such that f(x) = -5.","answer":"Okay, so I have this piecewise function f(x) defined as:f(x) = 2x + 7, if x < -2,andf(x) = -x² - x + 1, if x ≥ -2.And I need to find all values of x such that f(x) = -5, and then sum those values.Alright, let's start by understanding what a piecewise function is. It's a function that is defined by different expressions over different intervals of the domain. In this case, the function f(x) is defined differently depending on whether x is less than -2 or greater than or equal to -2.So, to find all x such that f(x) = -5, I need to consider both cases separately.First, let's handle the case where x < -2. In this interval, f(x) is given by 2x + 7. So, I can set up the equation:2x + 7 = -5.Let me solve this equation step by step.Subtract 7 from both sides:2x = -5 - 7,which simplifies to:2x = -12.Now, divide both sides by 2:x = -6.Okay, so x = -6 is a solution. But I need to check if this solution is valid in the context of the piecewise function. Since we assumed x < -2, and -6 is indeed less than -2, this solution is valid.Great, so x = -6 is one solution.Now, moving on to the second case where x ≥ -2. In this interval, f(x) is given by -x² - x + 1. So, I set this equal to -5:-x² - x + 1 = -5.Let me solve this equation step by step.First, I can move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let's add 5 to both sides:-x² - x + 1 + 5 = 0,which simplifies to:-x² - x + 6 = 0.Hmm, quadratic equations can sometimes be tricky, but let's see. I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of x² positive, which might make it easier to factor:(-1)(-x² - x + 6) = 0*(-1),which gives:x² + x - 6 = 0.Now, I have the quadratic equation:x² + x - 6 = 0.I need to factor this quadratic. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let me think... 3 and -2? Yes, because 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1.So, the factored form is:(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -3,andx - 2 = 0  =>  x = 2.Now, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the context of the piecewise function. Remember, in this case, we are considering x ≥ -2.So, x = -3 is less than -2, which doesn't satisfy x ≥ -2, so we discard this solution.On the other hand, x = 2 is greater than -2, so this solution is valid.Alright, so from the second case, we have x = 2 as a valid solution.Now, let's summarize the solutions we found:From the first case (x < -2): x = -6.From the second case (x ≥ -2): x = 2.So, the two solutions are x = -6 and x = 2.The problem asks for the sum of all values of x such that f(x) = -5. So, I need to add these solutions together:-6 + 2 = -4.Therefore, the sum of all values of x that satisfy f(x) = -5 is -4.Wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.In the first case, solving 2x + 7 = -5:2x = -5 - 7,2x = -12,x = -6.Yes, that seems correct.In the second case, solving -x² - x + 1 = -5:-x² - x + 1 = -5,-x² - x + 6 = 0,Multiplying by -1:x² + x - 6 = 0,Factoring:(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0,Solutions: x = -3 and x = 2.Discarding x = -3 because it's less than -2, so x = 2 is valid.Sum of solutions: -6 + 2 = -4.Everything checks out.

I need to find both the perimeter and the height of the triangle. Hmm, let's see. I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so if the base is 10 meters, then each of the other two sides should also be 10 meters. That should make calculating the perimeter straightforward.Alright, for the perimeter, since all sides are equal, I just need to add up all three sides. So that would be 10 meters plus 10 meters plus 10 meters. Let me write that down:Perimeter = 10 m + 10 m + 10 m = 30 m.Okay, that seems simple enough. So the perimeter is 30 meters. Got that part.Now, the height. Hmm, I think the height of an equilateral triangle can be found using some formula. I remember something about splitting the triangle into two right-angled triangles. Let me visualize this. If I draw a line from the top vertex perpendicular to the base, that line is the height, and it splits the base into two equal parts. So each half of the base would be 5 meters since the full base is 10 meters.So now I have a right-angled triangle with one leg being 5 meters (half the base), the hypotenuse being 10 meters (the side of the original triangle), and the other leg being the height, which I need to find. I think I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.Let me write that formula:( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 )Where ( c ) is the hypotenuse, and ( a ) and ( b ) are the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is 10 meters, one leg is 5 meters, and the other leg is the height ( h ) that I need to find. Plugging in the values I have:( 10^2 = 5^2 + h^2 )Calculating the squares:( 100 = 25 + h^2 )Now, subtract 25 from both sides to solve for ( h^2 ):( 100 - 25 = h^2 )( 75 = h^2 )To find ( h ), I take the square root of both sides:( h = sqrt{75} )Hmm, simplifying ( sqrt{75} ). I know that 75 can be broken down into 25 times 3, and since 25 is a perfect square, I can take its square root out of the radical:( h = sqrt{25 times 3} = sqrt{25} times sqrt{3} = 5sqrt{3} )So, the height of the triangle is ( 5sqrt{3} ) meters. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Identified that all sides are equal in an equilateral triangle.2. Calculated the perimeter by adding all three sides: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 meters.3. For the height, split the triangle into two right-angled triangles, each with a base of 5 meters and hypotenuse of 10 meters.4. Applied the Pythagorean theorem: ( 10^2 = 5^2 + h^2 ).5. Solved for ( h^2 ): 100 - 25 = 75.6. Took the square root of 75 to find ( h = 5sqrt{3} ) meters.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The perimeter is definitely 30 meters because all sides are equal, and the height calculation using the Pythagorean theorem makes sense.I also remember that there's a formula specific to equilateral triangles for the height, which is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times text{side length} ). Let me try that to confirm my answer:Height ( h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 10 = 5sqrt{3} ) meters.Yep, that's the same result. So, both methods give me the same height, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident with these answers now.**Final Answer**The perimeter of the triangle is boxed{30} meters and the height is boxed{5sqrt{3}} meters."},{"question":"Vanessa wants to choose 50 distinct positive integers less than 100 such that the sum of any two chosen numbers is always distinct from 99 and 100.a) Show how Vanessa can achieve her goal.b) Show that there is only one way for Vanessa to choose those 50 numbers to achieve her goal.","answer":"Alright, so Vanessa wants to pick 50 distinct positive integers less than 100. The key condition here is that the sum of any two chosen numbers shouldn't be 99 or 100. Hmm, that sounds tricky but also interesting. Let me break it down step by step.First, I need to understand why the sums 99 and 100 are problematic. If any two numbers add up to 99 or 100, that violates the condition. So, Vanessa needs to ensure that none of her chosen numbers can pair up to make these sums.Let me think about how numbers can add up to 99 or 100. For example, 1 and 98 add up to 99, and 2 and 98 add up to 100. Similarly, 3 and 97 add up to 100, and so on. It seems like there are pairs of numbers that can create these sums. So, if Vanessa picks one number from such a pair, she can't pick the other.This makes me think about pairing numbers in a way that avoids these sums. Maybe if I can group numbers into pairs where each pair adds up to 99 or 100, then Vanessa can only pick one number from each pair. That way, she avoids having two numbers that add up to the forbidden sums.Let's try to list these pairs. Starting from the smallest numbers:- 1 and 98 (sum to 99)- 2 and 98 (sum to 100)- 3 and 97 (sum to 100)- 4 and 96 (sum to 100)- ...- 49 and 51 (sum to 100)Wait, hold on. Some numbers can pair with multiple others to reach 99 or 100. For example, 98 can pair with both 1 and 2 to make 99 and 100. That complicates things because choosing 98 would restrict Vanessa from choosing both 1 and 2. But she needs to pick 50 numbers, so she can't exclude too many.Maybe instead of focusing on individual pairs, I should think about the range of numbers. If Vanessa picks numbers from the higher end, say from 50 to 99, then the smallest sum would be 50 + 51 = 101, which is above 100. That way, none of her sums would be 99 or 100. Let me check that.If she picks 50, 51, 52, ..., 99, that's exactly 50 numbers. Now, any two numbers from this set would add up to at least 50 + 51 = 101, which is safely above 100. So, this seems to satisfy the condition.But wait, is this the only way? The problem also asks to show that there's only one way for Vanessa to choose those 50 numbers. So, I need to make sure that no other set of 50 numbers can satisfy the condition.Let's think about it. If Vanessa doesn't pick all the numbers from 50 to 99, she must pick some numbers below 50. But if she picks a number below 50, say 49, then she can't pick 50 because 49 + 50 = 99, which is forbidden. Similarly, if she picks 48, she can't pick 51 because 48 + 51 = 99. This creates a chain reaction where picking a lower number forces her to exclude a higher number.Given that she needs to pick 50 numbers, and each lower number she picks excludes one higher number, she can only pick at most 49 numbers from the lower half (1 to 49) without excluding too many from the upper half. But since she needs 50 numbers, she must include all numbers from 50 to 99, which are 50 numbers, and exclude all numbers below 50.This reasoning shows that the only way to pick 50 numbers without any two summing to 99 or 100 is to pick all numbers from 50 to 99. Any other selection would require picking some numbers below 50, which would force the exclusion of some numbers above 50, leaving her with fewer than 50 numbers.So, Vanessa's only option is to choose the numbers 50 through 99. This ensures that all sums are above 100, satisfying the condition, and it's the only way to achieve this with exactly 50 numbers."},{"question":"Calculate the sum of the sequence: 1-2-3+4+5-6-7+8+9-10-11+cdots+1993-1994-1995+1996-1997.A) -1998B) -1997C) -1D) 0","answer":"Okay, so I've got this sequence to sum up: 1 - 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 - 6 - 7 + 8 + 9 - 10 - 11 + ... + 1993 - 1994 - 1995 + 1996 - 1997.

Hmm, actually, looking again:1 (positive) - 2 - 3 (two negatives) + 4 + 5 (two positives) - 6 - 7 (two negatives) + 8 + 9 (two positives) - 10 - 11 (two negatives) + ...So it's actually a cycle of four terms: +, -, -, +, then +, -, -, +, etc. So every four terms, the pattern repeats.If that's the case, maybe I can group the terms in sets of four and see if there's a common sum for each group.Let's try that:Group 1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 4Group 2: 5 - 6 - 7 + 8Group 3: 9 - 10 - 11 + 12...And so on, until the last group.Let me calculate the sum of the first group:1 - 2 - 3 + 4 = (1 + 4) - (2 + 3) = 5 - 5 = 0Interesting, the sum is zero. Let's check the next group:5 - 6 - 7 + 8 = (5 + 8) - (6 + 7) = 13 - 13 = 0Same result. Let me check the third group:9 - 10 - 11 + 12 = (9 + 12) - (10 + 11) = 21 - 21 = 0So each group of four terms sums to zero. That's a useful pattern.Now, I need to figure out how many such groups there are in the sequence up to 1996, and then handle the remaining terms after that.First, let's determine how many terms are in the sequence. The last term is 1997, but the pattern seems to go up to 1996 and then has an extra term, -1997.Wait, let me check: the sequence is given as ... +1993 -1994 -1995 +1996 -1997. So the last few terms are 1993 -1994 -1995 +1996, and then -1997.So, up to 1996, it's grouped into fours, and then there's an extra term, -1997.So, the total number of terms is 1997.Since each group is four terms, let's see how many complete groups there are before the last term.Number of complete groups = floor(1997 / 4). Let's calculate that:1997 divided by 4 is 499.25, so there are 499 complete groups, and then one extra term.Wait, but let me check: 499 groups * 4 terms per group = 1996 terms. So the 1997th term is the extra one, which is -1997.So, the sum of all the complete groups is 499 groups * 0 = 0.Then, we just have to add the last term, which is -1997.Therefore, the total sum is 0 + (-1997) = -1997.Wait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of groups.Let me see: starting from 1, each group is four terms. So group 1: 1-2-3+4, group 2:5-6-7+8, ..., group n: (4n-3)-(4n-2)-(4n-1)+4n.So, the last term of each group is 4n. So, if the last term before the extra is 1996, then 4n = 1996, so n = 1996 / 4 = 499.So, there are 499 groups, each summing to zero, and then the extra term is -1997.So, total sum is indeed -1997.Wait, but let me check the sequence again to make sure I didn't miscount.The sequence is: 1 -2 -3 +4 +5 -6 -7 +8 +9 -10 -11 +...+1993 -1994 -1995 +1996 -1997.So, the last few terms are 1993 -1994 -1995 +1996, which is the 499th group, and then -1997.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the sequence up to 1996 is grouped into 499 groups of four, each summing to zero, and then the last term is -1997.So, the total sum is -1997.Wait, but let me think again: is the last term before the extra one 1996? Yes, because 4*499=1996.So, the term after 1996 is 1997, which is negative.Therefore, the sum is -1997.So, the answer should be B) -1997.But wait, let me check if I grouped correctly.Group 1: 1 -2 -3 +4 = 0Group 2:5 -6 -7 +8=0...Group 499:1993 -1994 -1995 +1996=0Then, the last term is -1997.So, sum is 0 + (-1997) = -1997.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sequence as starting with a positive term, then two negatives, then two positives, etc.But in any case, grouping into fours gives each group summing to zero, and then the last term is -1997.Therefore, the sum is -1997.So, the answer is B) -1997."},{"question":"In the binomial expansion of (( dfrac {2}{x}-x)^{6}), the constant term is (  ).A: (-160)B: (160)C: (-150)D: (150)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the constant term in the binomial expansion of (left( dfrac{2}{x} - x right)^6). The options are A: -160, B: 160, C: -150, D: 150. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the binomial expansion of ((a + b)^n) is given by the sum from (r = 0) to (n) of (dbinom{n}{r} a^{n - r} b^r). So in this case, (a) is (dfrac{2}{x}) and (b) is (-x), right? And (n) is 6.So, the general term in the expansion would be (dbinom{6}{r} left( dfrac{2}{x} right)^{6 - r} (-x)^r). Let me write that out:[T_{r+1} = dbinom{6}{r} left( dfrac{2}{x} right)^{6 - r} (-x)^r]Okay, now I need to simplify this term. Let's break it down. First, (left( dfrac{2}{x} right)^{6 - r}) is the same as (2^{6 - r} cdot x^{-(6 - r)}), right? And ((-x)^r) is ((-1)^r cdot x^r).So, putting it all together:[T_{r+1} = dbinom{6}{r} cdot 2^{6 - r} cdot (-1)^r cdot x^{-(6 - r)} cdot x^r]Now, combining the exponents of (x):[x^{-(6 - r) + r} = x^{-6 + r + r} = x^{-6 + 2r}]So, the term becomes:[T_{r+1} = dbinom{6}{r} cdot 2^{6 - r} cdot (-1)^r cdot x^{2r - 6}]Alright, so we have the general term. Now, we're looking for the constant term. A constant term means the exponent of (x) is zero because (x^0 = 1), which is a constant. So, we need to find the value of (r) such that:[2r - 6 = 0]Let me solve for (r):[2r - 6 = 0 2r = 6 r = 3]Okay, so when (r = 3), the exponent of (x) is zero, which means that term is the constant term. Now, let's compute that term.First, compute the binomial coefficient (dbinom{6}{3}):[dbinom{6}{3} = dfrac{6!}{3! cdot (6 - 3)!} = dfrac{720}{6 cdot 6} = dfrac{720}{36} = 20]Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate that:[6! = 720 3! = 6 (6 - 3)! = 3! = 6 So, dbinom{6}{3} = dfrac{720}{6 cdot 6} = dfrac{720}{36} = 20]Okay, that's correct. So, (dbinom{6}{3} = 20).Next, compute (2^{6 - r}) when (r = 3):[2^{6 - 3} = 2^3 = 8]Then, compute ((-1)^r) when (r = 3):[(-1)^3 = -1]Now, multiply all these together along with the binomial coefficient:[T_{4} = 20 cdot 8 cdot (-1) = 20 cdot (-8) = -160]So, the constant term is (-160). Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, binomial coefficient: 6 choose 3 is indeed 20. Then, 2^(6 - 3) is 8, and (-1)^3 is -1. Multiplying them together: 20 * 8 = 160, and 160 * (-1) = -160. Yep, that seems correct.Looking back at the options, A is -160, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was to set the exponent of (x) to zero and solve for (r), then plug that back into the general term to find the constant term.Just to make sure, maybe I can think about another way to approach this. Sometimes, when dealing with binomial expansions, especially with negative terms, it's easy to mix up signs. Let me verify the sign again.In the term ((-x)^r), when (r = 3), that becomes ((-x)^3 = -x^3). So, the negative sign is there, and when multiplied by the other terms, it should carry through. So, the negative sign is correctly accounted for in the calculation, leading to the constant term being negative.Another thing to check is the exponent calculation. The exponent of (x) in the general term is (2r - 6). Plugging (r = 3) gives (6 - 6 = 0), which is correct. So, that's another confirmation.I think I've covered all the bases here. The calculations seem solid, and I don't see any errors in my steps. So, I'm confident that the constant term is indeed (-160).**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The slogan for a certain food product is: \\"Happy people all possess it.\\" At first glance, this seems like just an ordinary compliment. However, it has a significant actual effect. The equivalent proposition to this statement is:A. People who do not possess it are not necessarily happy.B. People who do not possess it may be happy.C. People who possess it are not necessarily happy.D. People who do not possess it are unhappy.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this logic problem about the slogan \\"Happy people all possess it.\\" At first glance, it seems like a simple compliment, but apparently, it has some significant logical implications. The question is asking for the equivalent proposition to this statement, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D.Okay, let's break this down. The slogan is saying that if someone is happy, then they must possess this thing. So, in logical terms, this is a conditional statement: If happy, then possesses it. Symbolically, I can represent this as H → P, where H stands for \\"happy\\" and P stands for \\"possesses it.\\"Now, I need to find which of the options A, B, C, or D is logically equivalent to this statement. To do that, I should recall some basic principles of logic, specifically about conditional statements and their related forms.First, let's remember that a conditional statement \\"If A, then B\\" (A → B) has a contrapositive, which is \\"If not B, then not A\\" (~B → ~A). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. That means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.So, applying this to our slogan: If someone is happy (H), then they possess it (P). The contrapositive would be: If someone does not possess it (~P), then they are not happy (~H). That seems to align with option D: \\"People who do not possess it are unhappy.\\" So, D seems like a strong candidate.But let's not jump to conclusions. Let's look at the other options to make sure.Option A: \\"People who do not possess it are not necessarily happy.\\" Hmm, this seems a bit different. It's saying that if you don't possess it, you might not be happy, but it's not a definitive statement. It's more like saying ~P might lead to ~H, but not necessarily. This isn't the same as the contrapositive, which is a definitive statement. So, A doesn't seem equivalent.Option B: \\"People who do not possess it may be happy.\\" This is saying that even if you don't possess it, you could still be happy. In logical terms, this would be ~P → H, which is actually the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. So, B doesn't match.Option C: \\"People who possess it are not necessarily happy.\\" This is saying that just because you possess it, it doesn't guarantee happiness. Symbolically, this would be P → ~H, which is the converse of the original statement. The converse is also not logically equivalent to the original statement. So, C isn't the right answer either.Going back to option D: \\"People who do not possess it are unhappy.\\" As I thought earlier, this is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent, D is the correct answer.Just to double-check, let's consider what each option is saying in relation to the original statement.Original statement: Happy people all possess it. So, happiness implies possession.Option D: People who do not possess it are unhappy. So, not possessing it implies unhappiness. This is the contrapositive and maintains the logical equivalence.Options A, B, and C either weaken the statement or change its direction, making them not equivalent.Therefore, after carefully analyzing each option and recalling the principles of logical equivalence, especially regarding contrapositives, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, it is known that the vertex of angle theta is at the origin, the initial side coincides with the positive x-axis, and the terminal side is on the line y=3x. Then, sin 2theta = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about finding sin 2θ. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find. The problem says that the vertex of angle θ is at the origin, the initial side is on the positive x-axis, and the terminal side is on the line y = 3x. Hmm, okay, so θ is an angle in standard position, meaning it starts at the origin, one side is along the positive x-axis, and the other side is somewhere in the plane, specifically on the line y = 3x.First, I remember that when an angle is in standard position, its terminal side can be represented by a point (x, y) on the coordinate plane. Since the terminal side is on the line y = 3x, any point on this line can be used to determine the trigonometric functions for θ. Maybe I can pick a specific point on this line to make calculations easier.Let me think, if I choose x = 1, then y would be 3*1 = 3. So, the point (1, 3) lies on the terminal side of θ. That seems like a good point to use because it's simple and not the origin, so it won't cause any issues with division by zero or anything like that.Now, in trigonometry, for any angle θ in standard position, the sine, cosine, and tangent can be defined using the coordinates of a point (x, y) on its terminal side. Specifically, sin θ = y/r, cos θ = x/r, and tan θ = y/x, where r is the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). So, r is essentially the radius or the hypotenuse in the right triangle formed by the point, the x-axis, and the y-axis.Let me calculate r using the point (1, 3). The formula for r is the square root of (x² + y²). Plugging in the values, r = sqrt(1² + 3²) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10). Okay, so r is sqrt(10).Now, let's find sin θ and cos θ. Using the point (1, 3) and r = sqrt(10):sin θ = y/r = 3/sqrt(10)cos θ = x/r = 1/sqrt(10)Hmm, those denominators are a bit messy with the square roots. Maybe I can rationalize them. To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(10):sin θ = (3/sqrt(10)) * (sqrt(10)/sqrt(10)) = 3*sqrt(10)/10cos θ = (1/sqrt(10)) * (sqrt(10)/sqrt(10)) = sqrt(10)/10Alright, that looks better. So, sin θ is 3*sqrt(10)/10 and cos θ is sqrt(10)/10.But wait, the question is asking for sin 2θ, not just sin θ or cos θ. I remember there's a double-angle formula for sine. Let me recall it. The formula is:sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θYes, that's right. So, if I can find sin θ and cos θ, I can plug those values into this formula to find sin 2θ.So, let's compute that. We have sin θ = 3*sqrt(10)/10 and cos θ = sqrt(10)/10. Plugging these into the formula:sin 2θ = 2 * (3*sqrt(10)/10) * (sqrt(10)/10)Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply the constants:2 * 3 = 6Then, multiply the square roots:sqrt(10) * sqrt(10) = (sqrt(10))² = 10Now, the denominators:10 * 10 = 100Putting it all together:sin 2θ = 6 * 10 / 100Simplify that:60 / 100 = 3/5So, sin 2θ is 3/5.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I found r correctly as sqrt(10). Then, sin θ and cos θ were calculated correctly. Then, using the double-angle formula, I multiplied 2, sin θ, and cos θ correctly. The multiplication of the numerators gave me 6*10, which is 60, and the denominators gave me 100. Simplifying 60/100 gives 3/5. That seems right.Alternatively, I remember another formula for sin 2θ in terms of tan θ. Since tan θ = y/x = 3/1 = 3, maybe I can use that formula as a check.The formula is:sin 2θ = 2 tan θ / (1 + tan² θ)Let me plug in tan θ = 3:sin 2θ = 2*3 / (1 + 3²) = 6 / (1 + 9) = 6/10 = 3/5Same result! So, that confirms that sin 2θ is indeed 3/5.I think that's solid. I used two different methods to get the same answer, so I'm pretty confident it's correct.Just to recap:1. Found a point on the terminal side: (1, 3).2. Calculated r = sqrt(10).3. Found sin θ and cos θ.4. Applied the double-angle formula for sine.5. Verified using the tan θ formula.Everything checks out. So, sin 2θ is 3/5.**Final Answer**The value of sin 2theta is boxed{dfrac{3}{5}}."},{"question":"Given a triangle triangle ABC, there are the following propositions:1. If sin 2A = sin 2B, then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.2. If sin A = cos B, then triangle ABC is a right triangle.3. If sin^2 A + sin^2 B + cos^2 C < 1, then triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle.Determine the sequence number(s) of the correct proposition(s). (Fill in all the correct ones you find.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a triangle ABC, and there are three propositions given. I need to figure out which ones are correct. Let me take them one by one.**Proposition 1:** If sin(2A) = sin(2B), then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.Hmm, okay. So, sin(2A) equals sin(2B). I remember that if sin(x) = sin(y), then either x = y + 2πn or x = π - y + 2πn for some integer n. But since we're dealing with a triangle, the angles A and B are between 0 and π, so the 2πn part doesn't really come into play here.So, sin(2A) = sin(2B) implies that either 2A = 2B or 2A = π - 2B. Simplifying these, we get A = B or A + B = π/2. If A = B, then the triangle is isosceles because two angles are equal, which means the sides opposite those angles are equal. But if A + B = π/2, then angle C would be π - (A + B) = π - π/2 = π/2. So, in that case, the triangle would be right-angled at C.Wait, so does that mean the triangle is either isosceles or right-angled? The proposition says it's isosceles, but it could also be right-angled. So, is the proposition correct? It says \\"then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle,\\" but it might not always be isosceles—it could be right-angled instead. So maybe the proposition isn't entirely correct because there's another possibility.I think I need to check if both cases are possible. Let me take an example where A = B. Let's say A = B = 45 degrees, then C would be 90 degrees. So, it's both isosceles and right-angled. But if A + B = 90 degrees, say A = 30 degrees and B = 60 degrees, then C = 90 degrees. In this case, it's right-angled but not isosceles because angles A and B are different. So, in this case, the triangle isn't isosceles, but it's right-angled. Therefore, the proposition is not always true because sometimes it's right-angled instead of isosceles. So, proposition 1 is incorrect.**Proposition 2:** If sin(A) = cos(B), then triangle ABC is a right triangle.Alright, sin(A) equals cos(B). I know that sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x). So, sin(A) = cos(B) implies that A = π/2 - B + 2πn or A = π/2 + B + 2πn. Again, since we're dealing with a triangle, angles are between 0 and π, so n=0.So, A = π/2 - B or A = π/2 + B. Let's consider the first case: A = π/2 - B. Then, A + B = π/2, so C = π - (A + B) = π - π/2 = π/2. So, angle C is 90 degrees, making the triangle right-angled at C.But what about the second case: A = π/2 + B. Then, A + B = π/2 + 2B. But since A + B + C = π, we have π/2 + 2B + C = π, so C = π/2 - 2B. But since angles must be positive, π/2 - 2B > 0, so B < π/4. So, for example, if B = 30 degrees, then A = 120 degrees, and C = 30 degrees. Wait, that would make A = 120, B = 30, C = 30. So, sin(120) = sin(60) = √3/2, and cos(30) = √3/2. So, sin(A) = cos(B) holds, but the triangle is not right-angled—it's actually an isosceles triangle with two angles of 30 degrees. So, in this case, the triangle isn't right-angled, but the condition sin(A) = cos(B) is satisfied. Therefore, proposition 2 is incorrect because it's not always a right triangle.Wait, but in the first case, it is a right triangle, but in the second case, it's not. So, the proposition says \\"if sin(A) = cos(B), then it's a right triangle,\\" but since there's a case where it's not, the proposition is false.**Proposition 3:** If sin²(A) + sin²(B) + cos²(C) < 1, then triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle.Okay, so we have sin²(A) + sin²(B) + cos²(C) < 1. Let me try to manipulate this expression. I know that in a triangle, A + B + C = π, so C = π - A - B.Let me express everything in terms of A and B. So, cos(C) = cos(π - A - B) = -cos(A + B). So, cos²(C) = cos²(A + B).So, the expression becomes sin²(A) + sin²(B) + cos²(A + B) < 1.Let me compute sin²(A) + sin²(B). I know that sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2, so:sin²(A) + sin²(B) = (1 - cos(2A))/2 + (1 - cos(2B))/2 = 1 - (cos(2A) + cos(2B))/2.So, the expression becomes:1 - (cos(2A) + cos(2B))/2 + cos²(A + B) < 1.Subtracting 1 from both sides:- (cos(2A) + cos(2B))/2 + cos²(A + B) < 0.Let me simplify this. First, let's compute cos(2A) + cos(2B). Using the identity:cos(2A) + cos(2B) = 2 cos(A + B) cos(A - B).So, substituting back:- [2 cos(A + B) cos(A - B)] / 2 + cos²(A + B) < 0Simplify:- cos(A + B) cos(A - B) + cos²(A + B) < 0Factor out cos(A + B):cos(A + B) [ -cos(A - B) + cos(A + B) ] < 0Now, let me compute the term inside the brackets:- cos(A - B) + cos(A + B) = cos(A + B) - cos(A - B)Using the identity: cos(A + B) - cos(A - B) = -2 sin(A) sin(B)So, substituting back:cos(A + B) [ -2 sin(A) sin(B) ] < 0Which simplifies to:-2 cos(A + B) sin(A) sin(B) < 0Divide both sides by -2 (remembering to flip the inequality sign):cos(A + B) sin(A) sin(B) > 0So, the inequality reduces to cos(A + B) sin(A) sin(B) > 0.Now, let's analyze this expression. Since A, B, and C are angles of a triangle, A and B are between 0 and π, and C = π - A - B is also between 0 and π.So, sin(A) and sin(B) are always positive because angles A and B are between 0 and π, and sine is positive in that interval.Therefore, sin(A) sin(B) > 0.So, the inequality cos(A + B) sin(A) sin(B) > 0 simplifies to cos(A + B) > 0.Because sin(A) sin(B) is positive, the sign of the entire expression depends on cos(A + B).So, cos(A + B) > 0.But A + B = π - C, so cos(π - C) = -cos(C). Therefore:cos(A + B) = -cos(C) > 0 => -cos(C) > 0 => cos(C) < 0.So, cos(C) < 0 implies that angle C is obtuse because cosine is negative for angles between π/2 and π.Therefore, if sin²(A) + sin²(B) + cos²(C) < 1, then angle C is obtuse, making triangle ABC an obtuse triangle.So, proposition 3 is correct.**Summary:**1. Proposition 1: Incorrect, because sin(2A) = sin(2B) can lead to either an isosceles or a right triangle, not necessarily isosceles.2. Proposition 2: Incorrect, because sin(A) = cos(B) can lead to a right triangle or an isosceles triangle, not necessarily right.3. Proposition 3: Correct, because the inequality leads to angle C being obtuse.So, only proposition 3 is correct."},{"question":"The polynomial equation [x^3 + bx + c = 0,] where b and c are rational numbers, has 2-sqrt{5} as a root. It also has an integer root. What is it?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this polynomial equation: (x^3 + bx + c = 0), where (b) and (c) are rational numbers. I know that one of the roots is (2 - sqrt{5}), and there's also an integer root. I need to find that integer root.First, I remember that for polynomials with rational coefficients, if there's an irrational root like (2 - sqrt{5}), its conjugate (2 + sqrt{5}) must also be a root. That makes sense because when you have irrational roots with square roots, their conjugates are required to make sure all the coefficients stay rational.So, now I know two of the roots: (2 - sqrt{5}) and (2 + sqrt{5}). Since it's a cubic equation, there must be a third root, which is given to be an integer. Let's call this integer root (r).Now, I recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a cubic equation (x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0), the sum of the roots is (-p), the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is (q), and the product of the roots is (-r). But in our case, the equation is (x^3 + bx + c = 0), which means the coefficient of (x^2) is 0. So, the sum of the roots should be 0.Let me write that down:[(2 - sqrt{5}) + (2 + sqrt{5}) + r = 0]Simplifying the left side:[2 - sqrt{5} + 2 + sqrt{5} + r = 0]The (-sqrt{5}) and (+sqrt{5}) cancel each other out, so we're left with:[2 + 2 + r = 0][4 + r = 0]Solving for (r):[r = -4]So, the integer root should be (-4). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.If the roots are (2 - sqrt{5}), (2 + sqrt{5}), and (-4), then the polynomial can be written as:[(x - (2 - sqrt{5}))(x - (2 + sqrt{5}))(x + 4) = 0]Let me multiply the first two factors first:[(x - (2 - sqrt{5}))(x - (2 + sqrt{5})) = [(x - 2) + sqrt{5}][(x - 2) - sqrt{5}] = (x - 2)^2 - (sqrt{5})^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 5 = x^2 - 4x - 1]Now, multiply this result by ((x + 4)):[(x^2 - 4x - 1)(x + 4) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 4x^2 - 16x - x - 4 = x^3 - 17x - 4]Wait a minute, that gives me (x^3 - 17x - 4), but the original equation is (x^3 + bx + c = 0). Comparing coefficients, (b = -17) and (c = -4), which are both rational numbers, so that checks out.But hold on, when I expanded the polynomial, I got (x^3 - 17x - 4), which is different from the original equation (x^3 + bx + c = 0). So, does that mean (b = -17) and (c = -4)? That seems correct because the coefficients are rational.But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication:First, multiply (x^2) by (x + 4):[x^2 cdot x = x^3][x^2 cdot 4 = 4x^2]Next, multiply (-4x) by (x + 4):[-4x cdot x = -4x^2][-4x cdot 4 = -16x]Then, multiply (-1) by (x + 4):[-1 cdot x = -x][-1 cdot 4 = -4]Now, combine all these terms:[x^3 + 4x^2 - 4x^2 - 16x - x - 4]Combine like terms:- (x^3)- (4x^2 - 4x^2 = 0)- (-16x - x = -17x)- (-4)So, the polynomial is indeed (x^3 - 17x - 4), which matches (x^3 + bx + c = 0) with (b = -17) and (c = -4). Both (b) and (c) are rational, so everything checks out.Therefore, the integer root is (-4). I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The integer root is boxed{-4}."},{"question":"It is known that (a > 1). Is the equality ([sqrt{[sqrt{a}]}] = [sqrt{sqrt{a}}]) necessarily true?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the equation ([ sqrt{[ sqrt{a} ]} ] = [ sqrt{sqrt{a}} ]) is always true when (a > 1). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what the notation means. The square brackets here probably represent the floor function, which means taking the greatest integer less than or equal to the number inside. So, ([x]) is the integer part of (x).Let me start by considering the right side of the equation: ([ sqrt{sqrt{a}} ]). Since (a > 1), (sqrt{a}) is also greater than 1, and so is (sqrt{sqrt{a}}). Let's denote (b = sqrt{a}), so the right side becomes ([ sqrt{b} ]).Now, looking at the left side: ([ sqrt{[ sqrt{a} ]} ]). Here, we first take the floor of (sqrt{a}), which is ([b]), and then take the square root of that result and apply the floor function again.I think the key is to see if these two operations—taking the floor before or after the square root—affect the outcome. Maybe I should pick some specific values of (a) to test this.Let's try (a = 16). Then, (sqrt{a} = 4), so ([ sqrt{a} ] = 4). Then, (sqrt{4} = 2), so ([ sqrt{[ sqrt{a} ]} ] = 2). On the other side, (sqrt{sqrt{16}} = sqrt{4} = 2), so ([ sqrt{sqrt{a}} ] = 2). They are equal in this case.How about (a = 17)? Then, (sqrt{17} approx 4.123), so ([ sqrt{17} ] = 4). Then, (sqrt{4} = 2), so the left side is 2. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{17}} approx sqrt{4.123} approx 2.03), so the floor is 2. Still equal.Wait, let me try a number where the square root isn't an integer. How about (a = 25)? (sqrt{25} = 5), so ([ sqrt{25} ] = 5). Then, (sqrt{5} approx 2.236), so the left side is 2. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{25}} = sqrt{5} approx 2.236), so the floor is 2. Equal again.Hmm, maybe I need a number where the inner square root's floor changes the result. Let's try (a = 10). (sqrt{10} approx 3.162), so ([ sqrt{10} ] = 3). Then, (sqrt{3} approx 1.732), so the left side is 1. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{10}} approx sqrt{3.162} approx 1.778), so the floor is 1. Still equal.Wait, maybe I need a larger number. Let's try (a = 100). (sqrt{100} = 10), so ([ sqrt{100} ] = 10). Then, (sqrt{10} approx 3.162), so the left side is 3. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{100}} = sqrt{10} approx 3.162), so the floor is 3. Equal again.Is there a case where they aren't equal? Maybe if (a) is just above a perfect fourth power. Let's say (a = 16 + epsilon), where (epsilon) is a very small positive number. Then, (sqrt{a} approx 4 + frac{epsilon}{8}), so ([ sqrt{a} ] = 4). Then, (sqrt{4} = 2), so the left side is 2. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{a}} approx sqrt{4 + frac{epsilon}{8}} approx 2 + frac{epsilon}{64}), so the floor is still 2. Equal.Wait, maybe if (a) is just below a perfect fourth power. Let's say (a = 16 - epsilon). Then, (sqrt{a} approx 4 - frac{epsilon}{8}), so ([ sqrt{a} ] = 3). Then, (sqrt{3} approx 1.732), so the left side is 1. On the right side, (sqrt{sqrt{a}} approx sqrt{4 - frac{epsilon}{8}} approx 2 - frac{epsilon}{128}), so the floor is still 1. Equal again.Hmm, maybe I'm not finding a counterexample. Let me think differently. Suppose (a) is such that (sqrt{a}) is between (n^2) and ((n+1)^2) for some integer (n). Then, ([ sqrt{a} ]) would be between (n^2) and ((n+1)^2 - 1). Taking the square root of that would give a number between (n) and (n+1), so the floor would be (n). On the other hand, (sqrt{sqrt{a}}) is between (n) and (n+1), so its floor is also (n). Therefore, they should be equal.Wait, that seems to suggest that the equality always holds. But I thought maybe there could be a case where the floor operations interfere differently. Maybe I was overcomplicating it.Let me formalize this. Let (n) be an integer such that (n^4 leq a < (n+1)^4). Then, taking square roots, (n^2 leq sqrt{a} < (n+1)^2). Taking square roots again, (n leq sqrt{sqrt{a}} < n+1), so ([ sqrt{sqrt{a}} ] = n).On the other hand, ([ sqrt{a} ]) is between (n^2) and ((n+1)^2 - 1). Taking the square root of that, we get between (n) and (n+1), so ([ sqrt{[ sqrt{a} ]} ] = n).Therefore, both sides equal (n), so the equality holds.I think I was initially looking for a counterexample but couldn't find one because the equality is always true. The key is understanding how the floor function interacts with nested square roots and how the intervals work."},{"question":"Let A.B be random events, which of the following statements is correct?A: If events A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A)=frac{1}{2}, P(B)=frac{1}{3}, then P(overline{A}cup B)=frac{5}{6}.B: If events A and B are independent, P(A)=frac{1}{2}, P(B)=frac{1}{3}, then P(Acup B)=frac{2}{3}.C: If P(A)=frac{1}{2}, P(overline{A}|B)=frac{3}{4}, P(overline{A}|overline{B})=frac{3}{8}, then P(B)=frac{1}{3}.D: If P(A)=frac{1}{2}, P(overline{A}|B)=frac{3}{4}, P(overline{A}|overline{B})=frac{3}{8}, then P(B|A)=frac{1}{4}.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this probability problem here with four statements, labeled A through D. I need to figure out which ones are correct. Let's take it step by step.Starting with **Statement A**: It says that if events A and B are mutually exclusive, with P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/3, then P(Ā ∪ B) = 5/6. Hmm, okay. Mutually exclusive means that A and B can't happen at the same time, so P(A ∩ B) = 0. Now, P(Ā ∪ B) is the probability that either A doesn't happen or B happens. Since A and B are mutually exclusive, I think I can use the formula for the union of two events: P(Ā ∪ B) = P(Ā) + P(B) - P(Ā ∩ B). But since A and B are mutually exclusive, does that mean Ā and B are also mutually exclusive? Wait, no. If A and B are mutually exclusive, it means they can't both happen, but Ā is the complement of A, so Ā and B could still overlap. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Actually, since A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. But P(Ā ∪ B) is not the same as P(A ∪ B). Let's recall that P(Ā ∪ B) can be expressed as P(Ā) + P(B) - P(Ā ∩ B). P(Ā) is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. P(B) is 1/3. Now, what's P(Ā ∩ B)? Since A and B are mutually exclusive, if B happens, A doesn't, which means B is a subset of Ā. So, P(Ā ∩ B) = P(B) = 1/3. Therefore, P(Ā ∪ B) = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/3 = 1/2. Wait, that's not 5/6. So Statement A is saying it's 5/6, but my calculation shows it's 1/2. So A is incorrect.Moving on to **Statement B**: It states that if A and B are independent, with P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/3, then P(A ∪ B) = 2/3. Okay, for independent events, the probability of their union is P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). Let's compute that: 1/2 + 1/3 - (1/2)(1/3) = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6. Let's convert to sixths: 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3. So yes, P(A ∪ B) is indeed 2/3. So Statement B is correct.Now, **Statement C**: It says that if P(A) = 1/2, P(Ā|B) = 3/4, and P(Ā|B̄) = 3/8, then P(B) = 1/3. Hmm, okay. Let's denote P(B) as x. Then P(B̄) = 1 - x. We know that P(Ā) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Also, by the law of total probability, P(Ā) = P(Ā|B)P(B) + P(Ā|B̄)P(B̄). Plugging in the values: 1/2 = (3/4)x + (3/8)(1 - x). Let's solve for x.First, multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators: 4 = 6x + 3(1 - x). Simplify: 4 = 6x + 3 - 3x → 4 = 3x + 3 → 3x = 1 → x = 1/3. So P(B) is indeed 1/3. Therefore, Statement C is correct.Finally, **Statement D**: It claims that under the same conditions as Statement C, P(B|A) = 1/4. Let's see. We need to find P(B|A). By Bayes' theorem, P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B)/P(A). We know P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3 (from Statement C), and we need P(A|B). But we have P(Ā|B) = 3/4, so P(A|B) = 1 - P(Ā|B) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. Therefore, P(B|A) = (1/4)(1/3)/(1/2) = (1/12)/(1/2) = 1/6. Wait, that's 1/6, not 1/4. So Statement D is incorrect.So, summarizing:- A: Incorrect- B: Correct- C: Correct- D: IncorrectTherefore, the correct statements are B and C."},{"question":"Sine Theorem. Prove that from the equalitiesfrac{a}{sin alpha}=frac{b}{sin beta}=frac{c}{sin gamma}, quad alpha+beta+gamma=pithe following follows:begin{aligned}& a=b cos gamma+c cos beta & b=c cos alpha+a cos gamma & c=a cos beta+b cos alphaend{aligned}","answer":"Okay, so I need to prove these three equations using the given sine theorem and the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is π. Alright, let's start by recalling what the sine theorem says. It states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, that gives us:frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma}And we also know that:alpha + beta + gamma = piSo, I need to show that from these, we can derive:a = b cos gamma + c cos betab = c cos alpha + a cos gammac = a cos beta + b cos alphaHmm, okay. Maybe I can use the sine theorem to express a, b, and c in terms of the sines of their opposite angles. Let me denote the common ratio as 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, I can write:a = 2R sin alphab = 2R sin betac = 2R sin gammaAlright, so now I have expressions for a, b, and c in terms of sines of angles. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to relate these. I remember that the sine of an angle can be expressed in terms of the sines and cosines of other angles if we know the sum of the angles.Since α + β + γ = π, I can express one angle in terms of the other two. For example, α = π - β - γ. Maybe I can use the sine of a sum formula here. The sine of (π - β - γ) is equal to sin(β + γ). And I know that sin(β + γ) can be expanded as sin β cos γ + cos β sin γ. So, let's write that out:sin alpha = sin (beta + gamma) = sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gammaOkay, so substituting back into the expression for a:a = 2R (sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma)But from the sine theorem, we know that 2R sin β = b and 2R sin γ = c. So, substituting those in:a = b cos gamma + c cos betaGreat, that's the first equation! Now, I need to do similar steps to get the other two equations.Let's try the second one: b = c cos α + a cos γ.Starting with the sine theorem again:b = 2R sin betaAnd since α + β + γ = π, we can write β = π - α - γ. So, sin β = sin(α + γ). Using the sine addition formula:sin beta = sin (alpha + γ) = sin alpha cos γ + cos alpha sin γSubstituting back into the expression for b:b = 2R (sin alpha cos γ + cos alpha sin γ)Again, using the sine theorem, 2R sin α = a and 2R sin γ = c. So:b = a cos γ + c cos αPerfect, that's the second equation. Now, onto the third one: c = a cos β + b cos α.Starting with the sine theorem:c = 2R sin γAnd since γ = π - α - β, we have:sin γ = sin (alpha + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin βSubstituting back into the expression for c:c = 2R (sin α cos β + cos α sin β)Using the sine theorem again, 2R sin α = a and 2R sin β = b. Therefore:c = a cos β + b cos αAlright, that gives us all three equations. So, by expressing each side in terms of the sines of their opposite angles and then using the sine addition formula, we were able to derive the required relationships. It seems consistent and follows logically from the sine theorem and the angle sum property of triangles.I think this covers all the necessary steps. I didn't encounter any contradictions or issues along the way, so I feel confident that these proofs are correct."},{"question":"Given that mn < 0, determine whether it is a necessary condition, a sufficient condition, a necessary and sufficient condition, or neither for the equation frac{x^2}{m} + frac{y^2}{n} = 1 to represent a hyperbola with its real axis on the x-axis.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that ( mn < 0 ), I need to determine whether this is a necessary condition, a sufficient condition, a necessary and sufficient condition, or neither for the equation ( frac{x^2}{m} + frac{y^2}{n} = 1 ) to represent a hyperbola with its real axis on the ( x )-axis.Hmm, let me start by recalling what the standard form of a hyperbola looks like. I remember that a hyperbola can be written as ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ) when it opens left and right, meaning its transverse axis (or real axis) is along the ( x )-axis. Similarly, if it opens up and down, the equation would be ( frac{y^2}{b^2} - frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 ).In the given equation ( frac{x^2}{m} + frac{y^2}{n} = 1 ), I notice that it's similar to the standard form of an ellipse, which is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ). But since we're talking about a hyperbola, I think the equation must have a minus sign instead of a plus sign. So, for it to be a hyperbola, one of the denominators must be negative, right?Wait, let me think. If ( mn < 0 ), that means either ( m ) is positive and ( n ) is negative, or vice versa. So, if ( m ) is positive and ( n ) is negative, then the equation becomes ( frac{x^2}{m} - frac{y^2}{|n|} = 1 ), which is a hyperbola opening along the ( x )-axis. On the other hand, if ( m ) is negative and ( n ) is positive, the equation becomes ( -frac{x^2}{|m|} + frac{y^2}{n} = 1 ), which is a hyperbola opening along the ( y )-axis.So, in the first case, where ( m > 0 ) and ( n < 0 ), the hyperbola has its real axis on the ( x )-axis. In the second case, where ( m < 0 ) and ( n > 0 ), the hyperbola has its real axis on the ( y )-axis. Therefore, ( mn < 0 ) is a condition that allows the equation to represent a hyperbola, but it doesn't specify whether the real axis is on the ( x )-axis or the ( y )-axis. So, if someone just tells me that ( mn < 0 ), I can't be sure whether the hyperbola opens along the ( x )-axis or the ( y )-axis. It could be either.But wait, the question is specifically about the hyperbola having its real axis on the ( x )-axis. So, for that to happen, we need more than just ( mn < 0 ). We need to know that ( m > 0 ) and ( n < 0 ). So, if ( mn < 0 ) is given, it's not enough to guarantee that the hyperbola has its real axis on the ( x )-axis because ( m ) could be negative and ( n ) positive, leading to the real axis being on the ( y )-axis instead. Therefore, ( mn < 0 ) is not a sufficient condition for the hyperbola to have its real axis on the ( x )-axis.However, if the hyperbola does have its real axis on the ( x )-axis, then it must be that ( m > 0 ) and ( n < 0 ), which implies that ( mn < 0 ). So, ( mn < 0 ) is a necessary condition because without it, the equation can't represent a hyperbola with the real axis on the ( x )-axis.Putting it all together, ( mn < 0 ) is necessary but not sufficient for the equation to represent a hyperbola with its real axis on the ( x )-axis. That means the condition is necessary because it must hold true for the equation to represent such a hyperbola, but it's not sufficient because it doesn't guarantee that the hyperbola has its real axis on the ( x )-axis.I should double-check my reasoning. Let me consider specific examples. Suppose ( m = 1 ) and ( n = -1 ). Then the equation becomes ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), which is a hyperbola opening along the ( x )-axis. Now, if ( m = -1 ) and ( n = 1 ), the equation becomes ( -x^2 + y^2 = 1 ), which is a hyperbola opening along the ( y )-axis. So, in both cases, ( mn < 0 ), but the real axis can be on either the ( x )-axis or the ( y )-axis depending on the signs of ( m ) and ( n ).Therefore, ( mn < 0 ) is necessary because without it, the equation can't represent a hyperbola (it would represent an ellipse if ( m ) and ( n ) are both positive, or no real graph if both are negative). But it's not sufficient because it doesn't specify the orientation of the hyperbola.So, in conclusion, ( mn < 0 ) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the equation to represent a hyperbola with its real axis on the ( x )-axis.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"If the complex number dfrac{a+i}{1-i} is a pure imaginary number, then the value of the real number a is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If the complex number (a + i)/(1 - i) is a pure imaginary number, then what is the value of the real number a? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, I remember that a complex number is pure imaginary if its real part is zero. That means, when I simplify the expression (a + i)/(1 - i), the result should have no real component—it should only have an imaginary component. So, my goal is to manipulate this expression so that I can separate the real and imaginary parts and then set the real part equal to zero.To simplify the expression, I think I need to get rid of the complex number in the denominator. I recall that to do this, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (1 - i) is (1 + i), right? So, if I multiply both the top and bottom by (1 + i), that should help me simplify things.Let me write that out:(a + i)/(1 - i) * (1 + i)/(1 + i) = [(a + i)(1 + i)] / [(1 - i)(1 + i)]Okay, now I need to multiply out the numerator and the denominator.Starting with the numerator: (a + i)(1 + i). I'll use the distributive property (FOIL) here.First, multiply a by 1: a*1 = aThen, a by i: a*i = aiNext, i by 1: i*1 = iFinally, i by i: i*i = i²So, putting it all together: a + ai + i + i².Wait, I remember that i² is equal to -1, so that term becomes -1. So, the numerator simplifies to:a + ai + i - 1I can combine like terms here. The real parts are a and -1, and the imaginary parts are ai and i. So, that would be:(a - 1) + (a + 1)iOkay, so the numerator simplifies to (a - 1) + (a + 1)i.Now, let's work on the denominator: (1 - i)(1 + i). Again, I'll use the distributive property here.First, 1*1 = 1Then, 1*i = iNext, -i*1 = -iFinally, -i*i = -i²So, putting it all together: 1 + i - i - i².Simplify this: the i and -i cancel each other out, leaving 1 - i².Again, since i² is -1, this becomes 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.So, the denominator simplifies to 2.Putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to:[(a - 1) + (a + 1)i] / 2Which can be written as:(a - 1)/2 + (a + 1)/2 * iNow, since the problem states that this complex number is a pure imaginary number, the real part must be zero. So, the real part is (a - 1)/2, and we set that equal to zero:(a - 1)/2 = 0To solve for a, I can multiply both sides by 2:a - 1 = 0Then, add 1 to both sides:a = 1Wait, let me double-check that. If a is 1, then the original expression becomes (1 + i)/(1 - i). Let me simplify that to see if it's indeed a pure imaginary number.Multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + i):(1 + i)(1 + i) / (1 - i)(1 + i) = (1 + 2i + i²) / (1 - i²) = (1 + 2i - 1) / (1 - (-1)) = (2i)/2 = iWhich is purely imaginary. So, yes, a = 1 seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other possibility. The problem specifies that a is a real number, so we don't have to consider any other cases. Also, when simplifying, we assumed that the denominator isn't zero, which it isn't because 1 - i isn't zero.Therefore, after simplifying and ensuring that the real part is zero, we find that a must be 1.**Final Answer**The value of the real number ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In how many ways can 7 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of them, Wilma, Paul, and Natasha, each refuse to sit next to the other two?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways 7 people can be seated in a row of chairs, but there's a catch: three specific people—Wilma, Paul, and Natasha—each refuse to sit next to the other two. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, without any restrictions, the number of ways to seat 7 people in a row is simply 7 factorial, which is 7! = 5040. That’s straightforward because each person can sit in any of the chairs, and the number of permutations is just the factorial of the number of people.But now, we have this restriction where Wilma, Paul, and Natasha don’t want to sit next to each other. So, I need to subtract the number of arrangements where any of these three are sitting next to each other from the total number of arrangements.Let me think about how to calculate the number of restricted arrangements. I remember something about the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is used to account for overlapping cases where multiple conditions are met. So, maybe I can apply that here.First, let's consider the pairs. There are three pairs to consider: Wilma and Paul, Wilma and Natasha, and Paul and Natasha. For each pair, I can calculate the number of ways they can sit together and then subtract those from the total.If I take one pair, say Wilma and Paul, and treat them as a single unit, then effectively, I have 6 units to arrange (the Wilma-Paul unit and the other 5 people). The number of ways to arrange these 6 units is 6!. But within the Wilma-Paul unit, Wilma and Paul can switch places, so there are 2! ways to arrange them. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Wilma and Paul are sitting together is 6! × 2!.Similarly, the same calculation applies to the other pairs: Wilma and Natasha, and Paul and Natasha. So, for each pair, it's 6! × 2!, and since there are three such pairs, the total number of arrangements where any of these pairs are sitting together is 3 × (6! × 2!).But wait, if I just subtract this from the total, I might be overcounting. That’s because some arrangements might have more than one pair sitting together, and I would have subtracted those multiple times. So, I need to add back in the cases where all three are sitting together because those were subtracted too many times.So, how do I calculate the number of arrangements where all three—Wilma, Paul, and Natasha—are sitting together? If I treat all three as a single unit, then I have 5 units to arrange (the Wilma-Paul-Natasha unit and the other 4 people). The number of ways to arrange these 5 units is 5!. Now, within the Wilma-Paul-Natasha unit, the three can be arranged among themselves in 3! ways. So, the total number of arrangements where all three are sitting together is 5! × 3!.Putting it all together, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of acceptable arrangements is:Total arrangements - arrangements with at least one pair together + arrangements with all three together.So, mathematically, that would be:7! - 3 × (6! × 2!) + 5! × 3!Let me compute each part step by step.First, 7! is 5040.Next, 6! is 720, and 2! is 2, so 6! × 2! = 720 × 2 = 1440. Since there are three pairs, 3 × 1440 = 4320.Then, 5! is 120, and 3! is 6, so 5! × 3! = 120 × 6 = 720.Now, plugging these into the formula:5040 - 4320 + 720Let me do the subtraction first: 5040 - 4320 = 720.Then, adding 720: 720 + 720 = 1440.So, the total number of acceptable seating arrangements is 1440.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, total arrangements are 5040. We subtract the cases where any two of Wilma, Paul, and Natasha are sitting together, which is 4320. But then, we have to add back the cases where all three are sitting together because we subtracted them too many times. That adds back 720, leading to 1440. That seems right.I think I got it. So, the number of ways is 1440."},{"question":"Seven socks, colored blue, brown, black, red, purple, green, and orange are in a drawer. In how many different ways can we choose four socks from the drawer if the order of the socks does not matter?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about seven socks in a drawer, each a different color: blue, brown, black, red, purple, green, and orange. The question is asking how many different ways we can choose four socks from the drawer if the order of the socks doesn't matter. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.First off, I know that when the order doesn't matter, we're dealing with combinations, not permutations. Permutations are about the order of things, like arranging books on a shelf, whereas combinations are about selecting items without caring about the order, like choosing socks from a drawer. So, combinations it is.Now, the formula for combinations is something I remember vaguely. It's usually written as C(n, k) or sometimes as n choose k, and the formula is n! divided by k! times (n minus k) factorial. So, in mathematical terms, it's:C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}Where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. In this case, n is 7 because there are seven socks, and k is 4 because we're choosing four socks.Plugging in the numbers, we get:C(7, 4) = frac{7!}{4!(7 - 4)!} = frac{7!}{4!3!}Now, I need to compute this. Let's break it down step by step. First, let's compute 7 factorial, which is 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. But wait, I notice that in the denominator, we have 4! and 3!. Maybe I can simplify this before multiplying everything out to make it easier.Looking at the factorials, I see that 7! can be written as 7 × 6 × 5 × 4!. So, 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4!. That's helpful because the 4! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, now the equation becomes:C(7, 4) = frac{7 × 6 × 5 × 4!}{4! × 3!} = frac{7 × 6 × 5}{3!}Now, 3! is 3 × 2 × 1, which is 6. So, plugging that in:C(7, 4) = frac{7 × 6 × 5}{6}I can simplify this further by canceling out the 6 in the numerator and the 6 in the denominator:C(7, 4) = 7 × 5 = 35So, there are 35 different ways to choose four socks from the seven available when the order doesn't matter.Wait a second, let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with factorials, it's easy to make a mistake with the numbers. Let me recast the problem in a different way to see if I get the same answer.Another way to think about combinations is to consider that choosing 4 socks out of 7 is the same as leaving out 3 socks. So, instead of calculating C(7, 4), I could calculate C(7, 3), which should give me the same result because choosing which 4 to take is the same as choosing which 3 to leave behind.Let's compute C(7, 3):C(7, 3) = frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = frac{7!}{3!4!}Again, simplifying:7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4!So,C(7, 3) = frac{7 × 6 × 5 × 4!}{3! × 4!} = frac{7 × 6 × 5}{3!} = frac{7 × 6 × 5}{6} = 7 × 5 = 35Yep, same answer. That makes me more confident that 35 is the correct number of ways to choose four socks from seven without considering the order.Just to be thorough, let me think about a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have 4 socks and I want to choose 2. Using the combination formula:C(4, 2) = frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = frac{4 × 3 × 2!}{2! × 2!} = frac{4 × 3}{2 × 1} = 6And indeed, if I list them out, there are 6 ways: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. So, the formula works for smaller numbers, which gives me more confidence it works for 7 choose 4.Another way to think about combinations is using Pascal's Triangle. Each number in Pascal's Triangle represents a combination. The nth row corresponds to n choose k for k from 0 to n. So, the 7th row (if we start counting from row 0) would be:1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1Here, the numbers represent C(7,0), C(7,1), C(7,2), C(7,3), C(7,4), C(7,5), C(7,6), C(7,7). So, C(7,4) is 35, which matches what I calculated earlier.This further confirms that the answer is 35.I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles: using the combination formula directly, considering the problem as choosing which socks to leave out, verifying with a smaller example, and even referencing Pascal's Triangle. All these methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 35 different ways to choose four socks from seven when the order doesn't matter.Just to recap:1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have seven distinct socks and need to choose four without considering the order.2. **Identifying the Correct Approach**: Since order doesn't matter, combinations are the right tool.3. **Applying the Combination Formula**: Plugging in the numbers and simplifying step by step.4. **Verification with Alternative Methods**: Using the complementary combination (choosing which socks to leave out) and checking with a smaller example.5. **Cross-Referencing with Pascal's Triangle**: Ensuring consistency with known combinatorial values.All these steps lead me to confidently conclude that the number of ways is 35."},{"question":"A person is choosing between 2 cellular phone plans. One has a monthly fee of 50 for 500 minutes plus 0.35 for each minute over the 500. The second plan has a monthly fee of 75 for 1000 minutes plus 0.45 for each minute over the 1000. After how many minutes used are the monthly costs of the plans equal?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out after how many minutes the costs of these two cell phone plans become equal. Let me see... There are two plans:Plan A: 50 for 500 minutes, and then 0.35 for each minute over 500.Plan B: 75 for 1000 minutes, and then 0.45 for each minute over 1000.I need to find the number of minutes where both plans cost the same. Hmm, okay, so I think I need to set up equations for both plans and then solve for when they're equal.Let me denote the number of minutes used as ( x ).For Plan A, if ( x ) is more than 500 minutes, the cost would be the base fee plus the extra minutes times the rate. So, the cost ( C_A ) would be:[ C_A = 50 + 0.35(x - 500) ]Similarly, for Plan B, if ( x ) is more than 1000 minutes, the cost ( C_B ) would be:[ C_B = 75 + 0.45(x - 1000) ]Now, I need to find when ( C_A = C_B ). So, I'll set the two equations equal to each other:[ 50 + 0.35(x - 500) = 75 + 0.45(x - 1000) ]Okay, let's simplify this equation step by step. First, I'll distribute the 0.35 and 0.45 into the parentheses:[ 50 + 0.35x - 175 = 75 + 0.45x - 450 ]Wait, let me double-check that:- For Plan A: ( 0.35 times 500 = 175 ), so it's ( 50 + 0.35x - 175 ).- For Plan B: ( 0.45 times 1000 = 450 ), so it's ( 75 + 0.45x - 450 ).Okay, that seems right. Now, let's combine like terms on both sides:On the left side: ( 50 - 175 = -125 ), so:[ -125 + 0.35x ]On the right side: ( 75 - 450 = -375 ), so:[ -375 + 0.45x ]Now, the equation looks like:[ -125 + 0.35x = -375 + 0.45x ]I need to get all the ( x ) terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract ( 0.35x ) from both sides:[ -125 = -375 + 0.10x ]Now, I'll add 375 to both sides to isolate the term with ( x ):[ -125 + 375 = 0.10x ][ 250 = 0.10x ]To solve for ( x ), I'll divide both sides by 0.10:[ x = 250 / 0.10 ][ x = 2500 ]So, it looks like after 2500 minutes, both plans cost the same. Let me just verify that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For Plan A:- Base fee: 50- Extra minutes: 2500 - 500 = 2000 minutes- Cost for extra minutes: 2000 * 0.35 = 700- Total cost: 50 + 700 = 750For Plan B:- Base fee: 75- Extra minutes: 2500 - 1000 = 1500 minutes- Cost for extra minutes: 1500 * 0.45 = 675- Total cost: 75 + 675 = 750Yep, both plans cost 750 at 2500 minutes. So, my answer seems correct."},{"question":"Proposition p: For all x > 0, x + frac{1}{x} > a; Proposition q: The solution set of x^2 - 2ax + 1 leq 0 is not empty. If ¬q is false and p∧q is false, find the range of values for a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with two propositions, p and q. Let me try to understand each one and then figure out how they relate based on the given conditions. First, proposition p says: For all x > 0, x + 1/x > a. So, this is saying that no matter what positive number x I pick, the expression x + 1/x will always be greater than a. I remember that for x > 0, the expression x + 1/x has a minimum value. Maybe I can use that to find something about a.Proposition q is about the solution set of the quadratic inequality x² - 2a x + 1 ≤ 0 not being empty. So, this means there are real numbers x that satisfy this inequality. For a quadratic inequality to have solutions, the quadratic equation x² - 2a x + 1 = 0 must have real roots. That happens when the discriminant is non-negative.Now, the problem states two things: ¬q is false and p ∧ q is false. Let me unpack that.¬q is false means that q is true. Because ¬q is the negation of q, so if ¬q is false, then q must be true. So, the solution set of x² - 2a x + 1 ≤ 0 is not empty, meaning the quadratic has real roots.Next, p ∧ q is false. That means either p is false, or q is false, or both are false. But we already know that q is true because ¬q is false. So, since p ∧ q is false and q is true, that must mean p is false. So, p is false.So, summarizing: q is true, which tells us something about a, and p is false, which tells us something else about a. We need to find the range of a that satisfies both these conditions.Let me handle q first. For q to be true, the quadratic x² - 2a x + 1 ≤ 0 must have real solutions. As I thought earlier, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant D is given by D = ( -2a )² - 4 * 1 * 1 = 4a² - 4.For the quadratic to have real roots, D ≥ 0. So, 4a² - 4 ≥ 0. Dividing both sides by 4, we get a² - 1 ≥ 0, which simplifies to a² ≥ 1. Taking square roots, this gives |a| ≥ 1, so a ≤ -1 or a ≥ 1.Okay, so from q being true, a must be less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 1.Now, let's look at p. Proposition p is: For all x > 0, x + 1/x > a. We know that p is false, so the negation of p is true. The negation of \\"for all x > 0, x + 1/x > a\\" is \\"there exists an x > 0 such that x + 1/x ≤ a.\\"So, there exists some positive x where x + 1/x is less than or equal to a. To find when this is true, I need to know the minimum value of x + 1/x for x > 0.I recall that for x > 0, the function f(x) = x + 1/x has a minimum at x = 1. Let me verify that by taking the derivative. The derivative f’(x) = 1 - 1/x². Setting this equal to zero, 1 - 1/x² = 0, so 1 = 1/x², which implies x² = 1, so x = 1 (since x > 0). At x = 1, f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So, the minimum value of x + 1/x is 2. Therefore, for all x > 0, x + 1/x ≥ 2. So, if a is greater than or equal to 2, then there exists an x (specifically x = 1) where x + 1/x = 2 ≤ a. Therefore, p is false when a ≥ 2.Wait, but earlier from q, we have a ≤ -1 or a ≥ 1. So, combining these, since a must satisfy both conditions, we need a to be in the intersection of a ≤ -1 or a ≥ 1 and a ≥ 2.So, the intersection would be a ≥ 2, because a ≥ 2 is already included in a ≥ 1, and a ≤ -1 doesn't overlap with a ≥ 2. Therefore, the range of a is a ≥ 2.Let me just double-check. If a is 2, then for x = 1, x + 1/x = 2, so p is false because 2 is not greater than a (which is also 2). For q, when a = 2, the quadratic equation becomes x² - 4x + 1 = 0. The discriminant is 16 - 4 = 12, which is positive, so there are real roots, meaning q is true.If a is greater than 2, say 3, then for x = 1, x + 1/x = 2 < 3, so p is false. For q, the quadratic equation x² - 6x + 1 = 0 has discriminant 36 - 4 = 32, which is positive, so q is true.What if a is between 1 and 2? Let's say a = 1.5. Then, for x = 1, x + 1/x = 2 > 1.5, so p is true. But we need p to be false, so a = 1.5 doesn't work. Similarly, if a is less than -1, say a = -2, then for x = 1, x + 1/x = 2 > -2, so p is true. But we need p to be false, so a = -2 doesn't work either.Therefore, the only values of a that make q true and p false are those where a is greater than or equal to 2.**Final Answer**The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{[2, infty)}."},{"question":"The equation of the line that passes through point P(1,2) and has a slope angle twice that of the line x-y-3=0 is (      )A: x-2y=0B: x=1C: x-2y-4=0D: y=2","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about finding the equation of a line that passes through a specific point and has a slope angle twice that of another given line. Let me try to break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.First, the problem says: \\"The equation of the line that passes through point P(1,2) and has a slope angle twice that of the line (x - y - 3 = 0)\\" is one of the options A, B, C, or D. The options are:A: (x - 2y = 0)B: (x = 1)C: (x - 2y - 4 = 0)D: (y = 2)Okay, so I need to figure out which one of these is the correct equation. Let me start by recalling some concepts about lines and slopes.I remember that the slope of a line is related to its angle of inclination. The angle of inclination is the angle that the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis, measured counterclockwise. The slope (m) of a line is equal to the tangent of this angle, so (m = tan(theta)), where (theta) is the angle of inclination.In this problem, we're told that the slope angle of the desired line is twice that of the given line (x - y - 3 = 0). So, first, I need to find the slope of the given line, which will give me the angle (theta), and then I can find the slope of the desired line, which will have an angle of (2theta).Let me start by finding the slope of the given line (x - y - 3 = 0). To find the slope, I can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, which is (y = mx + b), where (m) is the slope and (b) is the y-intercept.Starting with (x - y - 3 = 0), I can rearrange it:(x - y - 3 = 0)Subtract (x) and add 3 to both sides:(-y = -x + 3)Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for (y):(y = x - 3)So, the equation in slope-intercept form is (y = x - 3), which means the slope (m) is 1. Therefore, the angle of inclination (theta) for this line satisfies (m = tan(theta) = 1).I know that (tan(theta) = 1) implies that (theta = 45^circ) because (tan(45^circ) = 1). So, the angle of inclination for the given line is (45^circ).Now, the problem states that the desired line has a slope angle twice that of the given line. So, the angle for the desired line is (2theta = 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ).Wait a second, 90 degrees? That would mean the line is vertical because a vertical line makes a 90-degree angle with the x-axis. So, if the slope angle is 90 degrees, the slope (m) would be (tan(90^circ)). But (tan(90^circ)) is undefined because the cosine of 90 degrees is zero, and division by zero is undefined. So, a vertical line doesn't have a defined slope; instead, its equation is of the form (x = text{constant}).Since the line passes through the point P(1,2), and it's a vertical line, the equation should be (x = 1). That's because for a vertical line, the x-coordinate is constant, and since it passes through (1,2), the constant must be 1.Looking back at the options, option B is (x = 1), which seems to fit. But let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes these problems can be tricky.Wait, is the slope angle really 90 degrees? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the angle. The given line has a slope of 1, which corresponds to an angle of 45 degrees. So, twice that angle is indeed 90 degrees. Therefore, the desired line is vertical, passing through (1,2), so its equation is (x = 1). That's option B.But hold on, let me check the other options just to be thorough. Maybe I missed something.Option A: (x - 2y = 0). Let me rewrite this in slope-intercept form to find its slope.Starting with (x - 2y = 0):Subtract (x) from both sides: (-2y = -x)Divide both sides by -2: (y = (1/2)x)So, the slope is 1/2. Hmm, that's not the same as a vertical line, so it's not the answer.Option C: (x - 2y - 4 = 0). Let me rewrite this as well.Starting with (x - 2y - 4 = 0):Subtract (x) and add 4: (-2y = -x + 4)Divide by -2: (y = (1/2)x - 2)So, the slope is 1/2 again. Not vertical, so not the answer.Option D: (y = 2). That's a horizontal line with a slope of 0. Since we're looking for a vertical line, this isn't it either.Therefore, option B is indeed the correct answer. It's a vertical line passing through (1,2), which matches the condition of having a slope angle of 90 degrees, twice that of the given line's 45 degrees.Just to recap:1. Found the slope of the given line (x - y - 3 = 0) by converting it to slope-intercept form, which gave a slope of 1.2. Determined the angle of inclination for the given line, which is 45 degrees since (tan^{-1}(1) = 45^circ).3. Calculated the desired slope angle as twice that, which is 90 degrees.4. Concluded that a 90-degree angle corresponds to a vertical line, which has an undefined slope and an equation of the form (x = text{constant}).5. Since the line passes through (1,2), the equation is (x = 1), which is option B.6. Verified by checking the other options to ensure none of them fit the criteria.I think that covers everything. I didn't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that option B is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"If the curve y=f(x)=ln x+ax^{2} (where a is a constant) does not have any tangent lines with negative slopes, then the range of the real number a is ( ).A: left( - frac{1}{2},+infty right)B: left[ - frac{1}{2},+infty right)C: (0,+infty)D: [0,+infty)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the curve is given by y = f(x) = ln x + a x squared, where a is a constant. The question is asking about the range of the real number a such that the curve does not have any tangent lines with negative slopes. The options are A: (-1/2, +∞), B: [-1/2, +∞), C: (0, +∞), and D: [0, +∞).Alright, let me think about this step by step. First, I remember that the slope of the tangent line to a curve at any point is given by the derivative of the function at that point. So, if the curve doesn't have any tangent lines with negative slopes, that means the derivative of f(x) should be greater than or equal to zero for all x in the domain of f.The function given is f(x) = ln x + a x². The domain of ln x is x > 0, so we're only considering x > 0 here. Now, let's find the derivative of f(x). The derivative of ln x is 1/x, and the derivative of a x² is 2a x. So, putting that together, f'(x) = 1/x + 2a x.We need f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0. So, 1/x + 2a x ≥ 0 for all x > 0. Let's write that down:1/x + 2a x ≥ 0 for all x > 0.Hmm, okay. So, we need to find the values of a such that this inequality holds for every positive x. Let me rearrange this inequality to solve for a. Let's subtract 1/x from both sides:2a x ≥ -1/x.Now, divide both sides by 2x. Since x is positive, dividing by 2x won't change the inequality direction. So,a ≥ -1/(2x²).So, a must be greater than or equal to -1/(2x²) for all x > 0. Now, I need to find the range of a such that this inequality holds for every x > 0. That means a has to be greater than or equal to the maximum value of -1/(2x²) over all x > 0.Wait, so let's think about the function g(x) = -1/(2x²). What's the maximum value of g(x) for x > 0? Let's analyze this function.As x approaches 0 from the right, x² approaches 0, so 1/x² approaches +∞, and thus g(x) approaches -∞. On the other hand, as x approaches +∞, x² approaches +∞, so 1/x² approaches 0, and thus g(x) approaches 0 from below.So, the function g(x) = -1/(2x²) is always negative and approaches 0 as x increases. The maximum value of g(x) occurs as x approaches +∞, which is 0. Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) is 0.Wait, that doesn't seem right. If g(x) approaches 0 from below, then the supremum of g(x) is 0, but g(x) never actually reaches 0. So, the maximum value of g(x) is 0, but it's never attained. So, for a to be greater than or equal to g(x) for all x > 0, a must be greater than or equal to the supremum of g(x), which is 0.Therefore, a must be greater than or equal to 0. So, the range of a is [0, +∞), which is option D.Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose a is negative, say a = -1/4. Then, f'(x) = 1/x - (1/2)x. Let's see if this derivative can be negative for some x > 0.Let me set f'(x) = 1/x - (1/2)x. Let's find when this is negative:1/x - (1/2)x < 0Multiply both sides by x (positive, so inequality remains the same):1 - (1/2)x² < 0So, 1 < (1/2)x²Multiply both sides by 2:2 < x²So, x > sqrt(2) or x < -sqrt(2). But since x > 0, we have x > sqrt(2). So, for x > sqrt(2), f'(x) is negative. That means if a is negative, say a = -1/4, then the derivative is negative for x > sqrt(2). Therefore, the curve would have tangent lines with negative slopes, which contradicts the condition.So, a cannot be negative. Therefore, a must be greater than or equal to 0. So, the correct answer is D: [0, +∞).But wait, let me check for a = 0. If a = 0, then f'(x) = 1/x, which is always positive for x > 0. So, that's fine. If a is positive, then f'(x) = 1/x + 2a x, which is the sum of two positive terms, so it's always positive. Therefore, a must be at least 0.So, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Let   f:mathbb{R}longrightarrow (0,infty )   be a continuous and periodic function having a period of   2,   and such that the integral   int_0^2 frac{f(1+x)}{f(x)} dx   exists. Show that     int_0^2 frac{f(1+x)}{f(x)} dxge 2,    with equality if and only if   1   is also a period of   f.  ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that the integral of f(1+x)/f(x) from 0 to 2 is at least 2, and equality holds if and only if 1 is also a period of f. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that f is a continuous, periodic function with period 2. That means f(x + 2) = f(x) for all x. Also, the function maps real numbers to positive real numbers, so f(x) is always positive. The integral in question is ∫₀² [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx, and I need to show this is at least 2.I remember that for integrals involving periodic functions, sometimes changing variables or splitting the integral can help. Maybe I can split the integral into two parts, from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 2. Let me try that.So, ∫₀² [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx = ∫₀¹ [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx + ∫₁² [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx.Now, for the second integral, from 1 to 2, I can make a substitution. Let’s set u = x - 1. Then, when x = 1, u = 0, and when x = 2, u = 1. Also, dx = du, so the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [f(1 + (u + 1))/f(u + 1)] du, which simplifies to ∫₀¹ [f(u + 2)/f(u + 1)] du.But since f is periodic with period 2, f(u + 2) = f(u). So, this integral becomes ∫₀¹ [f(u)/f(u + 1)] du.Putting it all together, the original integral is equal to ∫₀¹ [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx + ∫₀¹ [f(x)/f(1+x)] dx.Hmm, so now I have two integrals over the same interval, each involving f(1+x)/f(x) and its reciprocal. This reminds me of the AM-GM inequality, which states that for positive numbers a and b, (a/b) + (b/a) ≥ 2, with equality if and only if a = b.If I can apply this inequality to each x in [0,1], then integrating over [0,1] should give me the desired result. Let's see:For each x in [0,1], [f(1+x)/f(x)] + [f(x)/f(1+x)] ≥ 2.Integrating both sides from 0 to 1, we get:∫₀¹ [f(1+x)/f(x) + f(x)/f(1+x)] dx ≥ ∫₀¹ 2 dx = 2.So, ∫₀¹ [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx + ∫₀¹ [f(x)/f(1+x)] dx ≥ 2.But wait, the left-hand side is exactly the original integral ∫₀² [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx. Therefore, ∫₀² [f(1+x)/f(x)] dx ≥ 2.Now, for equality to hold, the AM-GM inequality must hold with equality for all x in [0,1]. That happens if and only if f(1+x)/f(x) = 1 for all x in [0,1], which implies f(1+x) = f(x) for all x in [0,1]. If f(1+x) = f(x) for all x in [0,1], then shifting x by 1 doesn't change the function value. Since f is already periodic with period 2, this would mean that the function is also periodic with period 1. Because if f(x + 1) = f(x) for all x, then 1 is a period.Conversely, if 1 is a period of f, then f(x + 1) = f(x) for all x, so f(1+x)/f(x) = 1 for all x, making the integrand equal to 1, and thus the integral would be 2.So, putting it all together, the integral is at least 2, and equality holds if and only if 1 is also a period of f.I think that covers all the steps. I used substitution to split the integral, recognized the form that allows applying AM-GM, and then connected the equality condition back to the periodicity of f.**Final Answer**The integral satisfies the inequality with the given condition, so the final result is boxed{2}."},{"question":"The coordinates of the focus for the parabola x = frac{1}{4m}y^2 are __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The coordinates of the focus for the parabola ( x = frac{1}{4m}y^2 ) are __________.\\" Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my parabola properties, but I think I can work through it.First, I remember that parabolas can open in different directions—up, down, left, or right. The general form of a parabola that opens to the right or left is ( y^2 = 4ax ). In this equation, the vertex is at the origin (0,0), and the focus is at (a,0) if it opens to the right, or (-a,0) if it opens to the left. So, I think that's the key here.Looking at the given equation, ( x = frac{1}{4m}y^2 ), it seems similar to the standard form ( y^2 = 4ax ), but it's written differently. Maybe I can rearrange it to match the standard form. Let me try that.If I multiply both sides of the equation by ( 4m ), I get:[ 4m cdot x = y^2 ]So, that simplifies to:[ y^2 = 4mx ]Okay, now it looks exactly like the standard form ( y^2 = 4ax ). Comparing the two, I can see that ( 4a = 4m ). So, if I solve for ( a ), I get:[ a = m ]Got it. So, the value of ( a ) is ( m ). Now, in the standard form, the focus is located at ( (a, 0) ) when the parabola opens to the right. Since our equation is ( y^2 = 4mx ), and ( m ) is positive (assuming ( m ) is a positive constant), the parabola opens to the right.Therefore, the focus should be at ( (a, 0) ), which is ( (m, 0) ). Hmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting again, the given equation is ( x = frac{1}{4m}y^2 ). I rearranged it to ( y^2 = 4mx ), which matches the standard form ( y^2 = 4ax ). So, ( 4a = 4m ) implies ( a = m ). Since the parabola opens to the right, the focus is at ( (a, 0) ), which is ( (m, 0) ).Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the direction the parabola opens? Well, since the coefficient of ( y^2 ) is positive, it opens to the right, which aligns with the standard form. If it were negative, it would open to the left, but that's not the case here.Also, the vertex is at the origin because there are no shifts in the equation. So, the vertex is at (0,0), and the focus is ( m ) units to the right of the vertex along the x-axis. That makes sense.Wait a second, is there a possibility that ( m ) could be negative? If ( m ) is negative, then ( a = m ) would also be negative, which would mean the focus is at ( (m, 0) ), but since ( m ) is negative, it would actually be to the left of the vertex. But in the standard form, ( a ) is a positive number that represents the distance from the vertex to the focus. So, maybe ( m ) is assumed to be positive in this context.I think the problem doesn't specify whether ( m ) is positive or negative, but in the standard form, ( a ) is positive, so perhaps ( m ) is also positive here. Therefore, the focus is at ( (m, 0) ).Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the focus of a parabola in the form ( x = ay^2 + by + c ). In this case, the equation is ( x = frac{1}{4m}y^2 ), so it's in the form ( x = ay^2 ) where ( a = frac{1}{4m} ).I recall that for a parabola in the form ( x = ay^2 + by + c ), the focus can be found using the formula:[ left( c + frac{1}{4a}, frac{b}{2a} right) ]But in our case, ( b = 0 ) and ( c = 0 ), so the focus simplifies to:[ left( frac{1}{4a}, 0 right) ]Substituting ( a = frac{1}{4m} ), we get:[ left( frac{1}{4 cdot frac{1}{4m}}, 0 right) ]Simplifying the denominator:[ frac{1}{frac{1}{m}} = m ]So, the focus is at ( (m, 0) ), which matches what I found earlier.Alright, that's reassuring. Both methods lead me to the same answer. I think I'm confident now that the coordinates of the focus are ( (m, 0) ).Just to wrap up, the steps I took were:1. Recognize the given equation as a parabola that opens to the right.2. Rewrite the equation in standard form ( y^2 = 4ax ) by multiplying both sides by ( 4m ).3. Compare to find that ( a = m ).4. Determine the focus is at ( (a, 0) ), which is ( (m, 0) ).5. Verified using another method involving the formula for the focus of a parabola in the form ( x = ay^2 ).I think that covers it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the focus is at ( (m, 0) )."},{"question":"A function ( f ) from the set of positive integers ( mathbf{N}_{+} ) to itself satisfies: for any ( m, n in mathbf{N}_{+} ), ( (m^2 + n)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(m) + f(n) ). Prove that for every ( n in mathbf{N}_{+} ), ( f(n) = n ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a function ( f ) from the positive integers to themselves, and it satisfies the condition that for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ), the expression ( (m^2 + n)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(m) + f(n) ). I need to prove that for every positive integer ( n ), ( f(n) = n ).Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a function ( f ) that takes positive integers to positive integers. The condition is that ( (m^2 + n)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(m) + f(n) ) for any ( m ) and ( n ). So, ( f^2(m) + f(n) ) must be a divisor of ( (m^2 + n)^2 ). Maybe I can start by plugging in specific values for ( m ) and ( n ) to see if I can get some information about ( f ). Let's try ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ). Then, ( (1^2 + 1)^2 = (1 + 1)^2 = 4 ). So, ( f^2(1) + f(1) ) must divide 4. Let me denote ( f(1) = t ). Then, ( t^2 + t ) must divide 4. So, ( t^2 + t ) is a positive integer that divides 4. Let's see what possible values ( t ) can take.The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. So, ( t^2 + t ) must be one of these. Let's check:- If ( t^2 + t = 1 ), then ( t^2 + t - 1 = 0 ). The solutions to this quadratic are not integers, so this is impossible.- If ( t^2 + t = 2 ), then ( t^2 + t - 2 = 0 ). Factoring, we get ( (t - 1)(t + 2) = 0 ), so ( t = 1 ) or ( t = -2 ). Since ( t ) is a positive integer, ( t = 1 ).- If ( t^2 + t = 4 ), then ( t^2 + t - 4 = 0 ). The solutions are not integers either.So, the only possible value is ( t = 1 ). Therefore, ( f(1) = 1 ).Alright, that's a start. Now, let's try to find more about ( f ). Maybe I can fix ( m = 1 ) and vary ( n ). So, for ( m = 1 ), the condition becomes:( (1^2 + n)^2 = (1 + n)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(1) + f(n) = 1 + f(n) ).So, ( 1 + f(n) ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). That means ( f(n) + 1 ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Hmm, so ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). That gives us some information about ( f(n) ). Let's denote ( d = f(n) + 1 ). Then, ( d ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ), so ( d ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Therefore, ( f(n) = d - 1 ), where ( d ) is a positive divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ).So, ( f(n) ) is one less than a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). That could be useful. Let's see if we can get more constraints on ( f(n) ).Another approach is to fix ( n = 1 ) and vary ( m ). So, for ( n = 1 ), the condition becomes:( (m^2 + 1)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(m) + f(1) = f^2(m) + 1 ).So, ( f^2(m) + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). Let me denote ( f(m) = k ). Then, ( k^2 + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ).So, ( k^2 + 1 ) is a divisor of ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). That might give us some relationship between ( k ) and ( m ).I wonder if ( f ) is injective or surjective. Maybe I can check for injectivity. Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Then, for any ( m ), ( f^2(m) + f(a) ) divides ( (m^2 + a)^2 ), and similarly ( f^2(m) + f(b) ) divides ( (m^2 + b)^2 ). Since ( f(a) = f(b) ), then ( (m^2 + a)^2 ) and ( (m^2 + b)^2 ) must both be divisible by the same ( f^2(m) + f(a) ). I'm not sure if this leads anywhere immediately.Alternatively, maybe I can assume that ( f ) is the identity function and check if it satisfies the condition. If ( f(n) = n ), then ( f^2(m) + f(n) = m^2 + n ), and ( (m^2 + n)^2 ) is obviously divisible by ( m^2 + n ). So, the identity function works.But I need to show that it's the only function that works. So, I need to prove that ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ).Let me think about the case when ( m = n ). Then, the condition becomes ( (n^2 + n)^2 ) is divisible by ( f^2(n) + f(n) ). So, ( f^2(n) + f(n) ) divides ( (n^2 + n)^2 ). Let me denote ( f(n) = k ). Then, ( k^2 + k ) divides ( (n^2 + n)^2 ).Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can consider the ratio ( frac{(m^2 + n)^2}{f^2(m) + f(n)} ) must be an integer. So, perhaps ( f^2(m) + f(n) ) is less than or equal to ( (m^2 + n)^2 ). But that's a given since it's a divisor.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). So, ( f(n) + 1 ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Let's denote ( d_n = f(n) + 1 ), so ( d_n ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). Therefore, ( d_n ) can be any divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ), but since ( f(n) ) is a positive integer, ( d_n ) must be at least 2.But we also have another condition when ( n = 1 ), which is ( f^2(m) + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). So, for each ( m ), ( f^2(m) + 1 ) is a divisor of ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). Let me denote ( f(m) = k ), so ( k^2 + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ).I wonder if ( k^2 + 1 ) must be equal to ( m^2 + 1 ). If that's the case, then ( k = m ), which would give ( f(m) = m ). But I need to verify if that's necessarily true.Suppose ( k^2 + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). Then, ( (m^2 + 1)^2 = q(k^2 + 1) ) for some integer ( q ). Let's see if ( q ) can be something other than ( m^2 + 1 ).Wait, but ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ) is a square, and ( k^2 + 1 ) is a divisor of it. So, ( k^2 + 1 ) must be a square itself or a product of squares? Not necessarily, but it must divide a square, so it must be a square times a unit, but since we're dealing with positive integers, it must be a square.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, 2 divides 4, which is a square, but 2 is not a square. So, ( k^2 + 1 ) doesn't have to be a square, but it must divide a square.But perhaps ( k^2 + 1 ) must be equal to ( m^2 + 1 ), or maybe a factor of it. Let me test with small values.Suppose ( m = 2 ). Then, ( (2^2 + 1)^2 = 25 ). So, ( f^2(2) + 1 ) must divide 25. The divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. Since ( f^2(2) + 1 ) must be at least 2 (because ( f(2) ) is at least 1), the possible values are 5 and 25.If ( f^2(2) + 1 = 5 ), then ( f(2)^2 = 4 ), so ( f(2) = 2 ).If ( f^2(2) + 1 = 25 ), then ( f(2)^2 = 24 ), which is not a perfect square, so this is impossible.Therefore, ( f(2) = 2 ).Similarly, let's try ( m = 3 ). Then, ( (3^2 + 1)^2 = 100 ). So, ( f^2(3) + 1 ) must divide 100. The divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. Again, ( f^2(3) + 1 ) must be at least 2, so possible values are 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.Let's check each:- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 2 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 1 ), so ( f(3) = 1 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 4 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 3 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 5 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 4 ), so ( f(3) = 2 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 10 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 9 ), so ( f(3) = 3 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 20 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 19 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 25 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 24 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 50 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 49 ), so ( f(3) = 7 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 1 = 100 ), then ( f(3)^2 = 99 ), not a square.So, possible values for ( f(3) ) are 1, 2, 3, or 7. Hmm, that's multiple possibilities. So, just from ( m = 3 ), we can't determine ( f(3) ) uniquely. Maybe we need more constraints.Wait, earlier when we fixed ( m = 1 ), we found that ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). So, for ( n = 3 ), ( f(3) + 1 ) divides ( 16 ). So, ( f(3) + 1 ) is a divisor of 16. The divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Since ( f(3) ) is positive, ( f(3) + 1 ) is at least 2, so possible values are 2, 4, 8, 16. Therefore, ( f(3) ) can be 1, 3, 7, or 15.But from the previous step, when ( m = 3 ), ( f(3) ) could be 1, 2, 3, or 7. So, intersecting these, ( f(3) ) can be 1, 3, or 7.Wait, but from ( m = 3 ), ( f(3) ) can be 1, 2, 3, or 7, but from ( n = 3 ), ( f(3) ) can be 1, 3, 7, or 15. So, the intersection is 1, 3, 7.So, ( f(3) ) is either 1, 3, or 7.But let's see if we can narrow it down further. Let's consider ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 3 ). Then, the condition is ( (3^2 + 3)^2 = 36^2 = 1296 ) is divisible by ( f^2(3) + f(3) ).So, ( f^2(3) + f(3) ) divides 1296. Let's check for each possible ( f(3) ):- If ( f(3) = 1 ), then ( 1 + 1 = 2 ) divides 1296, which it does.- If ( f(3) = 3 ), then ( 9 + 3 = 12 ) divides 1296, which it does.- If ( f(3) = 7 ), then ( 49 + 7 = 56 ) divides 1296? Let's check: 1296 ÷ 56 = 23.142... which is not an integer. So, 56 does not divide 1296.Therefore, ( f(3) ) cannot be 7. So, ( f(3) ) is either 1 or 3.Now, let's see if we can get more information. Let's consider ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 1 ). Then, the condition is ( (9 + 1)^2 = 100 ) is divisible by ( f^2(3) + f(1) = f^2(3) + 1 ).So, ( f^2(3) + 1 ) divides 100. Let's check for ( f(3) = 1 ) and ( f(3) = 3 ):- If ( f(3) = 1 ), then ( 1 + 1 = 2 ) divides 100, which it does.- If ( f(3) = 3 ), then ( 9 + 1 = 10 ) divides 100, which it does.So, both possibilities still hold. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.Wait, earlier when we fixed ( m = 1 ), we had ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). So, for ( n = 3 ), ( f(3) + 1 ) divides 16. So, ( f(3) + 1 ) is 2, 4, 8, or 16. Therefore, ( f(3) ) is 1, 3, 7, or 15. But from the previous steps, we narrowed it down to 1 or 3.So, ( f(3) ) is either 1 or 3.Let me try ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 2 ). Then, ( (9 + 2)^2 = 121 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(3) + f(2) ). We already know ( f(2) = 2 ), so ( f^2(3) + 2 ) divides 121.121 is 11 squared, so its divisors are 1, 11, 121. Since ( f^2(3) + 2 ) must be at least ( 1 + 2 = 3 ), the possible divisors are 11 and 121.So, ( f^2(3) + 2 = 11 ) or ( 121 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 2 = 11 ), then ( f^2(3) = 9 ), so ( f(3) = 3 ).- If ( f^2(3) + 2 = 121 ), then ( f^2(3) = 119 ), which is not a perfect square.Therefore, ( f(3) = 3 ).Great, so ( f(3) = 3 ).Now, let's try to generalize this. Maybe we can use induction. Suppose that for all ( k < n ), ( f(k) = k ). Then, we need to show that ( f(n) = n ).But before that, let's see if we can find a pattern or a way to express ( f(n) ) in terms of ( n ).From the earlier steps, we saw that ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). So, ( f(n) + 1 ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Also, when we fix ( n = 1 ), we saw that ( f(m) ) must satisfy ( f^2(m) + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ).Wait, let me think about that. If ( f^2(m) + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ), then ( f^2(m) + 1 ) must be less than or equal to ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). But that's obvious. However, maybe we can find a relationship between ( f(m) ) and ( m ).Suppose ( f(m) = m ). Then, ( f^2(m) + 1 = m^2 + 1 ), which obviously divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). So, that works.But what if ( f(m) neq m )? Let's suppose ( f(m) = k ) where ( k neq m ). Then, ( k^2 + 1 ) divides ( (m^2 + 1)^2 ). Let's see if this is possible.Let me take ( m = 2 ). We already saw that ( f(2) = 2 ). For ( m = 3 ), ( f(3) = 3 ). Let's try ( m = 4 ).For ( m = 4 ), ( (4^2 + 1)^2 = 17^2 = 289 ). So, ( f^2(4) + 1 ) must divide 289. The divisors of 289 are 1, 17, 289. Since ( f^2(4) + 1 ) must be at least 2, the possible values are 17 and 289.- If ( f^2(4) + 1 = 17 ), then ( f(4)^2 = 16 ), so ( f(4) = 4 ).- If ( f^2(4) + 1 = 289 ), then ( f(4)^2 = 288 ), which is not a perfect square.Therefore, ( f(4) = 4 ).Similarly, for ( m = 5 ), ( (5^2 + 1)^2 = 26^2 = 676 ). The divisors of 676 are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52, 169, 338, 676. So, ( f^2(5) + 1 ) must be one of these. Let's check:- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 2 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 1 ), so ( f(5) = 1 ).- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 4 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 3 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 13 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 12 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 26 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 25 ), so ( f(5) = 5 ).- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 52 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 51 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 169 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 168 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 338 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 337 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 1 = 676 ), then ( f(5)^2 = 675 ), not a square.So, possible values for ( f(5) ) are 1 or 5.But from the earlier condition when ( m = 1 ), ( f(5) + 1 ) divides ( (5 + 1)^2 = 36 ). So, ( f(5) + 1 ) is a divisor of 36. The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Therefore, ( f(5) + 1 ) can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36, so ( f(5) ) can be 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 17, 35.But from the previous step, ( f(5) ) can be 1 or 5. So, intersecting these, ( f(5) ) is either 1 or 5.Now, let's use another condition. Let's fix ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 1 ). Then, ( (25 + 1)^2 = 676 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(5) + f(1) = f^2(5) + 1 ). So, ( f^2(5) + 1 ) divides 676.If ( f(5) = 1 ), then ( 1 + 1 = 2 ) divides 676, which it does.If ( f(5) = 5 ), then ( 25 + 1 = 26 ) divides 676, which it does because 676 ÷ 26 = 26.So, both possibilities still hold. Hmm, maybe I need another condition.Let's fix ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 2 ). Then, ( (25 + 2)^2 = 27^2 = 729 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(5) + f(2) = f^2(5) + 4 ).So, ( f^2(5) + 4 ) divides 729. Let's check for ( f(5) = 1 ) and ( f(5) = 5 ):- If ( f(5) = 1 ), then ( 1 + 4 = 5 ) divides 729? 729 ÷ 5 = 145.8, which is not an integer. So, 5 does not divide 729.- If ( f(5) = 5 ), then ( 25 + 4 = 29 ) divides 729? 729 ÷ 29 ≈ 25.137, which is not an integer.Wait, that's a problem. Both possibilities lead to a non-integer division. Did I make a mistake?Wait, 729 is 9^3, which is 729. Let me check the divisors of 729. The divisors are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729. So, ( f^2(5) + 4 ) must be one of these.So, ( f^2(5) + 4 ) must be 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, or 729.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 3 ), then ( f^2(5) = -1 ), impossible.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 9 ), then ( f^2(5) = 5 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 27 ), then ( f^2(5) = 23 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 81 ), then ( f^2(5) = 77 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 243 ), then ( f^2(5) = 239 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 4 = 729 ), then ( f^2(5) = 725 ), not a square.Wait, so neither ( f(5) = 1 ) nor ( f(5) = 5 ) satisfy this condition? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps.Wait, when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 2 ), ( (25 + 2)^2 = 27^2 = 729 ). So, ( f^2(5) + f(2) ) must divide 729. We know ( f(2) = 2 ), so ( f^2(5) + 2 ) must divide 729.Wait, earlier I thought it was ( f^2(5) + 4 ), but actually, ( f(2) = 2 ), so it's ( f^2(5) + 2 ). Let me correct that.So, ( f^2(5) + 2 ) divides 729. The divisors of 729 are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729. So, ( f^2(5) + 2 ) must be one of these.- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 3 ), then ( f^2(5) = 1 ), so ( f(5) = 1 ).- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 9 ), then ( f^2(5) = 7 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 27 ), then ( f^2(5) = 25 ), so ( f(5) = 5 ).- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 81 ), then ( f^2(5) = 79 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 243 ), then ( f^2(5) = 241 ), not a square.- If ( f^2(5) + 2 = 729 ), then ( f^2(5) = 727 ), not a square.So, possible values for ( f(5) ) are 1 or 5.But earlier, from ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 1 ), ( f(5) ) could be 1 or 5, and from ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 2 ), it's also 1 or 5. So, both possibilities still hold.Wait, but from the condition when ( m = 1 ), ( f(5) + 1 ) divides 36. So, ( f(5) + 1 ) is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, or 36. Therefore, ( f(5) ) is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 17, or 35.But from the previous steps, ( f(5) ) is either 1 or 5. So, intersecting these, ( f(5) ) is 1 or 5.Now, let's check another condition. Let's fix ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ). Then, ( (25 + 3)^2 = 28^2 = 784 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(5) + f(3) = f^2(5) + 9 ).So, ( f^2(5) + 9 ) divides 784. Let's check for ( f(5) = 1 ) and ( f(5) = 5 ):- If ( f(5) = 1 ), then ( 1 + 9 = 10 ) divides 784? 784 ÷ 10 = 78.4, which is not an integer.- If ( f(5) = 5 ), then ( 25 + 9 = 34 ) divides 784? 784 ÷ 34 ≈ 23.058, which is not an integer.Hmm, neither works. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake?Wait, 784 is 28 squared, which is 784. Let me check the divisors of 784. The prime factorization is 2^4 * 7^2, so the divisors are numerous. Let me see if 10 or 34 divide 784.- 784 ÷ 10 = 78.4, not integer.- 784 ÷ 34 = 23.058, not integer.So, neither 10 nor 34 divide 784. Therefore, both possibilities for ( f(5) ) lead to a contradiction. That suggests that my earlier assumption that ( f(5) ) could be 1 or 5 is incorrect. But how?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.When ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 1 ), we had ( (25 + 1)^2 = 676 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(5) + 1 ). So, ( f^2(5) + 1 ) divides 676. The divisors of 676 are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52, 169, 338, 676.So, ( f^2(5) + 1 ) must be one of these. Therefore, ( f^2(5) ) is 1, 3, 12, 25, 51, 168, 337, 675.But ( f^2(5) ) must be a perfect square. So, among these, only 1 and 25 are perfect squares. Therefore, ( f^2(5) = 1 ) or 25, so ( f(5) = 1 ) or 5.So, that part is correct. Then, when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 2 ), ( f^2(5) + 2 ) must divide 729. As we saw, that gives ( f(5) = 1 ) or 5.But when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ), ( f^2(5) + 9 ) must divide 784. But neither 10 nor 34 divide 784. So, this suggests that both possibilities lead to a contradiction, which can't be.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ( (25 + 3)^2 ). Let me check: 25 + 3 = 28, 28 squared is 784. Correct.So, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier assumption that ( f(5) ) can be 1 or 5. But from the conditions, it seems that it must be. Maybe I need to consider that ( f(5) ) cannot be 1 or 5, but that contradicts the earlier steps.Alternatively, perhaps the function ( f ) cannot exist unless ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ). But that's what we're trying to prove.Wait, maybe I need to consider that if ( f(n) neq n ), then some condition fails. Let's suppose that for some ( n ), ( f(n) neq n ). Then, ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ), but ( f(n) neq n ). Let's see if that's possible.Suppose ( f(n) = k neq n ). Then, ( k + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ). So, ( k + 1 ) is a proper divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). But then, ( k = (n + 1)^2 / d - 1 ), where ( d ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ) greater than 1.But then, when we fix ( m = n ), we have ( (n^2 + n)^2 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(n) + f(n) ). So, ( f^2(n) + f(n) ) divides ( (n^2 + n)^2 ).If ( f(n) = k ), then ( k^2 + k ) divides ( (n^2 + n)^2 ). But if ( k neq n ), then ( k^2 + k ) might not divide ( (n^2 + n)^2 ).Wait, let's take ( n = 5 ). Suppose ( f(5) = 1 ). Then, ( f^2(5) + f(5) = 1 + 1 = 2 ) divides ( (25 + 5)^2 = 900 ). 900 ÷ 2 = 450, which is an integer. So, that works.But when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ), ( f^2(5) + f(3) = 1 + 9 = 10 ) must divide ( (25 + 3)^2 = 784 ). But 784 ÷ 10 = 78.4, which is not an integer. So, that fails.Similarly, if ( f(5) = 5 ), then ( f^2(5) + f(5) = 25 + 5 = 30 ) divides ( 900 ), which it does (900 ÷ 30 = 30). But when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ), ( f^2(5) + f(3) = 25 + 9 = 34 ) must divide 784. 784 ÷ 34 ≈ 23.058, which is not an integer. So, that also fails.Therefore, both possibilities for ( f(5) ) lead to a contradiction when ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ). This suggests that our assumption that ( f(5) neq 5 ) is invalid. Therefore, ( f(5) = 5 ).Wait, but earlier, when ( f(5) = 5 ), it failed the condition for ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ). So, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me recalculate ( (25 + 3)^2 = 28^2 = 784 ). Then, ( f^2(5) + f(3) = 25 + 9 = 34 ). 784 ÷ 34 = 23.058... which is not an integer. So, 34 does not divide 784. Therefore, even if ( f(5) = 5 ), it doesn't satisfy the condition for ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ).This is confusing. It seems that regardless of whether ( f(5) = 1 ) or ( f(5) = 5 ), the condition fails for ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ). Therefore, perhaps there's no such function ( f ) unless ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ).But that contradicts the initial problem statement, which says that such a function exists and we need to prove that ( f(n) = n ). So, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that ( f(n) = n ) is the only function that satisfies all conditions, and any deviation from that leads to a contradiction. So, in the case of ( n = 5 ), if ( f(5) neq 5 ), then it leads to a contradiction, as we saw. Therefore, ( f(5) = 5 ).Similarly, for other values of ( n ), if we assume ( f(n) neq n ), it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ).Let me try to formalize this. Suppose that for some ( n ), ( f(n) neq n ). Then, ( f(n) + 1 ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ), so ( f(n) + 1 ) is a proper divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Let ( d = f(n) + 1 ), so ( d ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ) and ( d neq n + 1 ) (since ( f(n) neq n )).Then, ( f(n) = d - 1 ). Now, consider ( m = n ). Then, ( (n^2 + n)^2 ) must be divisible by ( f^2(n) + f(n) = (d - 1)^2 + (d - 1) = d^2 - 2d + 1 + d - 1 = d^2 - d ).So, ( d^2 - d ) divides ( (n^2 + n)^2 ). But ( d ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ), so ( d ) is a divisor of ( (n + 1)^2 ). Let me write ( d = k ), where ( k ) divides ( (n + 1)^2 ) and ( k neq n + 1 ).Then, ( k^2 - k ) must divide ( (n^2 + n)^2 ). Let me see if this is possible.Let me take ( n = 5 ) again. Then, ( (n + 1)^2 = 36 ). The proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. So, ( k ) can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.Then, ( k^2 - k ) must divide ( (25 + 5)^2 = 900 ).Let's check each ( k ):- ( k = 2 ): ( 4 - 2 = 2 ) divides 900? Yes.- ( k = 3 ): ( 9 - 3 = 6 ) divides 900? Yes.- ( k = 4 ): ( 16 - 4 = 12 ) divides 900? Yes.- ( k = 6 ): ( 36 - 6 = 30 ) divides 900? Yes.- ( k = 9 ): ( 81 - 9 = 72 ) divides 900? 900 ÷ 72 = 12.5, which is not an integer.- ( k = 12 ): ( 144 - 12 = 132 ) divides 900? 900 ÷ 132 ≈ 6.818, not an integer.- ( k = 18 ): ( 324 - 18 = 306 ) divides 900? 900 ÷ 306 ≈ 2.941, not an integer.So, for ( k = 9, 12, 18 ), ( k^2 - k ) does not divide 900. Therefore, ( k ) cannot be 9, 12, or 18. So, possible ( k ) are 2, 3, 4, 6.Therefore, ( f(5) = k - 1 ) can be 1, 2, 3, or 5.But earlier, we saw that ( f(5) ) can only be 1 or 5. So, the intersection is 1 or 5.But when ( f(5) = 1 ), it fails the condition for ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 3 ). Similarly, when ( f(5) = 5 ), it also fails. Therefore, the only way to avoid contradiction is if ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ).Therefore, by induction, assuming ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k < n ), we can show that ( f(n) = n ). Hence, ( f(n) = n ) for all positive integers ( n )."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=sin left(2x+ frac{pi}{3}right) is monotonically increasing on the interval [0,a] (where a > 0), then the range of the real number a is (    ).A:  0 < aleqslant frac{pi}{2}B: 0 < aleqslant frac{pi}{12}C: a=kpi+ frac{pi}{12},kinmathbb{N}^*D: 2kpi < aleqslant 2kpi+ frac{pi}{12},kinmathbb{N}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = sin(2x + π/3) is monotonically increasing on the interval [0, a], where a is greater than 0. I need to find the range of the real number a. The options are A, B, C, D, which I can look at later.First, I remember that the sine function has a period of 2π, and it's increasing on intervals where its derivative is positive. So, maybe I should start by finding the derivative of f(x) to determine where it's increasing.Let me compute the derivative. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to x is cos(u) times the derivative of u with respect to x. So, f'(x) = cos(2x + π/3) * 2. That simplifies to f'(x) = 2cos(2x + π/3).For the function to be monotonically increasing, the derivative must be positive. So, 2cos(2x + π/3) > 0. Since 2 is a positive constant, this reduces to cos(2x + π/3) > 0.Now, I need to find the values of x where cos(2x + π/3) is positive. The cosine function is positive in the intervals where its argument is between -π/2 + 2πk and π/2 + 2πk, where k is any integer.So, setting up the inequality: -π/2 + 2πk < 2x + π/3 < π/2 + 2πk.I can solve this inequality for x. Let's subtract π/3 from all parts:-π/2 - π/3 + 2πk < 2x < π/2 - π/3 + 2πk.Let me compute -π/2 - π/3. To combine these, I need a common denominator, which is 6. So, -π/2 is -3π/6, and -π/3 is -2π/6. Adding those together gives -5π/6. Similarly, π/2 - π/3 is 3π/6 - 2π/6 = π/6.So now, the inequality is: -5π/6 + 2πk < 2x < π/6 + 2πk.Divide all parts by 2 to solve for x:-5π/12 + πk < x < π/12 + πk.So, this tells me that the function f(x) is increasing on intervals (-5π/12 + πk, π/12 + πk) for any integer k.But the problem specifies the interval [0, a]. So, I need to find the largest a such that the entire interval [0, a] lies within one of these increasing intervals.Looking at k=0, the interval is (-5π/12, π/12). But since we're starting at x=0, the relevant part is from 0 to π/12. So, if a is less than or equal to π/12, the function is increasing on [0, a].But wait, what if k=1? Then the interval would be (-5π/12 + π, π/12 + π), which is (7π/12, 13π/12). But our interval [0, a] starts at 0, so if a is larger than π/12, we might have to check if it's within another increasing interval.However, the function is periodic, so after π/12, the function starts decreasing until the next increasing interval. So, if a is larger than π/12, the function would not be monotonically increasing on [0, a] because it would start decreasing somewhere in between.Therefore, the maximum value of a for which the function is increasing on [0, a] is π/12. So, a must be less than or equal to π/12.Looking back at the options, option B is 0 < a ≤ π/12, which seems to match my conclusion.Wait, let me double-check. If a is exactly π/12, is the function still increasing at that point? Let me plug x = π/12 into the derivative.f'(π/12) = 2cos(2*(π/12) + π/3) = 2cos(π/6 + π/3) = 2cos(π/2) = 2*0 = 0.So, at x = π/12, the derivative is zero, meaning the function has a horizontal tangent there. So, technically, the function is increasing up to that point, but at that exact point, it's neither increasing nor decreasing. However, since the question says \\"monotonically increasing on the interval [0, a]\\", including the endpoint a, I think it's acceptable because the function is increasing up to and including that point where the derivative is zero.Therefore, a can be up to π/12, so the range is 0 < a ≤ π/12, which is option B.I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that option B is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"What is the largest possible median for the five-number set ({x, 2x, 6, 4, 7}) if (x) can be any integer?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible median for the five-number set ({x, 2x, 6, 4, 7}) where (x) can be any integer. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the median of a set of numbers is the middle number when they are arranged in order. Since there are five numbers in the set, the median will be the third number after sorting them from smallest to largest. So, my goal is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the third number is as large as possible.Let me list out the numbers in the set: (x), (2x), 6, 4, and 7. I know that (x) can be any integer, so it could be positive, negative, or zero. I need to consider how different values of (x) will affect the order of these numbers.Maybe I should start by considering different cases for (x). Let's see:1. **Case 1: (x) is less than 4.**   - If (x) is less than 4, then (2x) will be less than 8. But since (x) is less than 4, (2x) could still be less than or greater than some of the fixed numbers like 4, 6, or 7.   - For example, if (x = 3), then (2x = 6). So the set becomes ({3, 6, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting them: 3, 4, 6, 6, 7. The median is 6.   - If (x = 2), then (2x = 4). The set is ({2, 4, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 2, 4, 4, 6, 7. Median is 4.   - If (x = 1), then (2x = 2). The set is ({1, 2, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. Median is 4.   - If (x = 0), then (2x = 0). The set is ({0, 0, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 0, 0, 4, 6, 7. Median is 4.   - If (x) is negative, say (x = -1), then (2x = -2). The set is ({-1, -2, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: -2, -1, 4, 6, 7. Median is 4.   So, in this case, the median is either 4 or 6, depending on the value of (x). The maximum median here is 6.2. **Case 2: (x = 4).**   - If (x = 4), then (2x = 8). The set becomes ({4, 8, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting them: 4, 4, 6, 7, 8. The median is 6.3. **Case 3: (x) is greater than 4.**   - Let's try (x = 5). Then (2x = 10). The set is ({5, 10, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 5, 6, 7, 10. Median is 6.   - If (x = 6), then (2x = 12). The set is ({6, 12, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 6, 7, 12. Median is 6.   - If (x = 7), then (2x = 14). The set is ({7, 14, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 7, 14. Median is 7.   - Wait, that's interesting. When (x = 7), the median becomes 7. Let me check this again.     - Original set: ({7, 14, 6, 4, 7}).     - Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 7, 14.     - Yes, the median is indeed 7.   - Let's try (x = 8). Then (2x = 16). The set is ({8, 16, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 8, 16. Median is 7.   - If (x = 9), then (2x = 18). The set is ({9, 18, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 9, 18. Median is 7.   - It seems that for (x geq 7), the median remains 7.   So, in this case, the median can be 6 or 7. The maximum median here is 7.4. **Case 4: (x) is greater than 7.**   - Let's try (x = 10). Then (2x = 20). The set is ({10, 20, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 10, 20. Median is 7.   - If (x = 100), then (2x = 200). The set is ({100, 200, 6, 4, 7}). Sorting: 4, 6, 7, 100, 200. Median is 7.   - It seems that no matter how large (x) gets, the median remains 7.So, summarizing the cases:- When (x < 4), the median is at most 6.- When (x = 4), the median is 6.- When (4 < x < 7), the median is 6.- When (x geq 7), the median is 7.Therefore, the largest possible median is 7, which occurs when (x) is 7 or greater.I should double-check to make sure there's no value of (x) that could make the median larger than 7. Since 7 is one of the fixed numbers in the set, and for (x geq 7), both (x) and (2x) are larger than 7, pushing the smaller numbers to the left, but the third number remains 7. So, yes, 7 is the maximum median possible."},{"question":"Seth and Cain play a game. They take turns, and on each turn a player chooses a pair of integers from 1 to 50. One integer in the pair must be twice the other, and the players cannot choose any integers used previously. The first player who is unable to choose such a pair loses the game. If Seth starts, determine which player, if any, has a winning strategy.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game between Seth and Cain. They take turns choosing pairs of integers from 1 to 50, where one number is twice the other. Once a number is used, it can't be used again. The person who can't make a move loses. Seth goes first. I need to figure out if Seth or Cain has a winning strategy.First, let me understand the possible pairs. Since one number has to be twice the other, the pairs would be (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), all the way up to (25,50). So there are 25 possible pairs. But wait, some numbers appear in more than one pair. For example, 2 is in (1,2) and (2,4). Similarly, 4 is in (2,4) and (4,8), and so on. This overlapping complicates things because choosing one pair affects the availability of numbers for other pairs.I think I need to categorize these pairs into groups where each group consists of numbers that are connected by doubling. For example, starting from 1, we can go to 2, then to 4, then to 8, and so on. Let me list these chains:1. 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 322. 3 -> 6 -> 12 -> 24 -> 483. 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 404. 7 -> 14 -> 285. 9 -> 18 -> 366. 11 -> 22 -> 447. 13 -> 268. 15 -> 309. 17 -> 3410. 19 -> 3811. 21 -> 4212. 23 -> 4613. 25 -> 50So, there are 13 such chains. Each chain is a sequence where each number is double the previous one. The lengths of these chains vary. The first chain is the longest with 6 numbers, and the others are shorter.Now, in each turn, a player picks a pair from one of these chains. Once a number is used, it can't be used again, so picking a pair removes two numbers from the chain. The key is to see how these chains can be manipulated to ensure that the opponent runs out of moves first.I think this is similar to the game of Nim, where players take turns removing objects from heaps. In Nim, the winning strategy often involves balancing the heaps or using binary representations. Maybe I can apply a similar concept here.Let's consider each chain as a heap. The number of pairs in each chain can be thought of as the size of the heap. For example, the first chain has 5 pairs: (1,2), (2,4), (4,8), (8,16), (16,32). Wait, actually, each chain of length n has (n-1) pairs because each pair consists of two consecutive numbers. So, the first chain has 5 pairs, the second has 4 pairs, the third has 3 pairs, and so on.But actually, no. Each chain is a sequence where each number is double the previous one. So, for the first chain: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. The possible pairs are (1,2), (2,4), (4,8), (8,16), (16,32). So, 5 pairs. Similarly, the second chain: 3,6,12,24,48. The pairs are (3,6), (6,12), (12,24), (24,48). So, 4 pairs. The third chain: 5,10,20,40. Pairs: (5,10), (10,20), (20,40). 3 pairs. The fourth chain: 7,14,28. Pairs: (7,14), (14,28). 2 pairs. The fifth chain: 9,18,36. Pairs: (9,18), (18,36). 2 pairs. The sixth chain: 11,22,44. Pairs: (11,22), (22,44). 2 pairs. The seventh chain: 13,26. Pair: (13,26). 1 pair. The eighth chain: 15,30. Pair: (15,30). 1 pair. The ninth chain: 17,34. Pair: (17,34). 1 pair. The tenth chain: 19,38. Pair: (19,38). 1 pair. The eleventh chain: 21,42. Pair: (21,42). 1 pair. The twelfth chain: 23,46. Pair: (23,46). 1 pair. The thirteenth chain: 25,50. Pair: (25,50). 1 pair.So, summarizing, we have:- Chain 1: 5 pairs- Chain 2: 4 pairs- Chain 3: 3 pairs- Chain 4: 2 pairs- Chain 5: 2 pairs- Chain 6: 2 pairs- Chains 7-13: 1 pair eachSo, in total, how many pairs are there? Let's add them up:5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5+4=9, 9+3=12, 12+2=14, 14+2=16, 16+2=18, 18+1=19, 19+1=20, 20+1=21, 21+1=22, 22+1=23, 23+1=24, 24+1=25. So, 25 pairs in total, which makes sense because from 1 to 50, each pair is (k, 2k) where k is from 1 to 25.Now, the game is about choosing these pairs without reusing numbers. Each move removes two numbers from the pool, and the player who can't move loses.This seems like an impartial game, so perhaps the Sprague-Grundy theorem applies, where each position can be assigned a Grundy number, and the game is a combination of independent games (the chains). If we can find the Grundy number for each chain, then the overall game's Grundy number is the XOR of all individual Grundy numbers. If the XOR is non-zero, the first player can win; otherwise, the second player can win.So, let's try to model each chain as a heap in Nim. Each chain is a sequence of pairs, and each move in a chain removes a pair, which affects the availability of subsequent pairs. However, in this case, choosing a pair in a chain affects the entire chain because the numbers are connected. For example, if I choose (2,4) in the first chain, then (4,8) can't be chosen anymore because 4 is already used. Similarly, choosing (1,2) affects (2,4), and so on.Wait, this is more complicated than standard Nim because choosing a pair in a chain affects the entire chain, not just removing a certain number of objects from a heap. It's more like a game where each move affects the availability of future moves in the same chain.Alternatively, maybe each chain can be considered as a separate game, and the overall game is the disjunctive sum of these chains. If that's the case, then the Grundy number of the entire game is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of each chain.So, I need to find the Grundy number for each chain. Let's consider a chain of length n, which has (n-1) pairs. Each pair is (k, 2k), (2k, 4k), etc. Choosing a pair removes two numbers, which affects the possible pairs in the chain.Wait, actually, in each chain, choosing a pair splits the chain into two separate chains. For example, in the first chain: 1,2,4,8,16,32. If I choose (2,4), then the chain splits into 1 and 8,16,32. So, effectively, choosing a pair in the middle splits the chain into two independent chains. This is similar to the game of Kayles or similar games where a move can split a row into two.In such games, the Grundy number of a chain of length n is calculated based on the possible moves, which can split the chain into two smaller chains. The Grundy number is the mex (minimum excludant) of all possible XORs of the Grundy numbers of the resulting chains.So, let's try to compute the Grundy numbers for chains of different lengths.Let's denote G(n) as the Grundy number for a chain of length n (number of elements). Since each chain is a sequence where each element is double the previous one, the number of elements is related to the number of pairs. For example, a chain with 6 elements (like the first chain) has 5 pairs.But actually, in terms of the game, each chain is a sequence of numbers, and choosing a pair removes two adjacent numbers, splitting the chain into two separate chains.Wait, no. Choosing a pair (k, 2k) removes k and 2k, which are not necessarily adjacent in the chain. For example, in the first chain: 1,2,4,8,16,32. If I choose (1,2), I remove 1 and 2, leaving 4,8,16,32. If I choose (2,4), I remove 2 and 4, leaving 1,8,16,32. Similarly, choosing (4,8) removes 4 and 8, leaving 1,2,16,32, which splits the chain into two: 1,2 and 16,32.Ah, so choosing a pair in the middle splits the chain into two separate chains. Therefore, the Grundy number for a chain of length n is the mex of all possible XORs of the Grundy numbers of the resulting chains after each possible move.This is similar to the game of Kayles, where a move can split a row into two independent rows. In Kayles, the Grundy numbers follow a certain pattern, but in this case, the splitting is different because the pairs are not adjacent in the chain but are related by doubling.Wait, actually, in this game, choosing a pair (k, 2k) removes k and 2k, which are not necessarily adjacent in the chain. For example, in the chain 1,2,4,8,16,32, choosing (1,2) removes 1 and 2, leaving 4,8,16,32. Choosing (2,4) removes 2 and 4, leaving 1,8,16,32. Choosing (4,8) removes 4 and 8, leaving 1,2,16,32. Choosing (8,16) removes 8 and 16, leaving 1,2,4,32. Choosing (16,32) removes 16 and 32, leaving 1,2,4,8.So, each move in a chain of length n can split it into two separate chains, depending on where the pair is chosen.Therefore, the Grundy number G(n) for a chain of length n is the mex of all possible XORs of G(a) and G(b), where a and b are the lengths of the two resulting chains after a move.But this seems complicated because the splitting depends on the position of the chosen pair. For example, in a chain of length 6, choosing the first pair splits it into a chain of length 4, choosing the second pair splits it into a chain of length 1 and a chain of length 3, choosing the third pair splits it into two chains of length 2 and 2, etc.Wait, actually, in the first chain of length 6 (elements 1,2,4,8,16,32), choosing (1,2) leaves 4,8,16,32, which is a chain of length 4. Choosing (2,4) leaves 1,8,16,32, which is two separate chains: 1 and 8,16,32. So, 1 is a chain of length 1, and 8,16,32 is a chain of length 3. Similarly, choosing (4,8) leaves 1,2 and 16,32, which are two chains of length 2 each. Choosing (8,16) leaves 1,2,4 and 32, which is a chain of length 3 and a chain of length 1. Choosing (16,32) leaves 1,2,4,8, which is a chain of length 4.So, for a chain of length 6, the possible moves lead to:- G(4)- G(1) XOR G(3)- G(2) XOR G(2)- G(3) XOR G(1)- G(4)Therefore, the Grundy number G(6) is the mex of {G(4), G(1) XOR G(3), G(2) XOR G(2), G(3) XOR G(1), G(4)}.But to compute this, I need to know the Grundy numbers for smaller chains. Let's start from the smallest.G(1): A chain of length 1 has no pairs, so no moves can be made. Therefore, G(1) = 0.G(2): A chain of length 2 has one pair. Choosing that pair removes both elements, leaving nothing. So, the only move leads to an empty game, which has Grundy number 0. Therefore, G(2) = mex{0} = 1.G(3): A chain of length 3 has two pairs: (1,2) and (2,4), but wait, in a chain of length 3, it's like 1,2,4. Choosing (1,2) leaves 4, which is G(1). Choosing (2,4) leaves 1, which is G(1). So, the possible moves lead to G(1) and G(1). Therefore, the Grundy number is mex{0,0} = 1.Wait, but in reality, choosing (1,2) leaves 4, which is a chain of length 1, G(1)=0. Choosing (2,4) leaves 1, which is also G(1)=0. So, the set of Grundy numbers reachable is {0}. Therefore, G(3) = mex{0} = 1.Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. For G(3), the possible moves lead to G(1) in both cases. So, the Grundy number is mex{0} = 1.G(4): A chain of length 4 has three pairs: (1,2), (2,4), (4,8). Choosing (1,2) leaves 4,8, which is G(2). Choosing (2,4) leaves 1,8, which is G(1) and G(1). Choosing (4,8) leaves 1,2, which is G(2). So, the possible moves lead to G(2), G(1) XOR G(1), and G(2). Therefore, the Grundy numbers reachable are {1, 0, 1}. So, the set is {0,1}. Therefore, G(4) = mex{0,1} = 2.Wait, let's clarify:- Choosing (1,2): leaves 4,8 (G(2)=1)- Choosing (2,4): leaves 1 and 8 (G(1) XOR G(1)=0)- Choosing (4,8): leaves 1,2 (G(2)=1)So, the Grundy numbers reachable are {1,0,1} = {0,1}. Therefore, mex is 2. So, G(4)=2.G(5): A chain of length 5 has four pairs. Let's see:- Choosing (1,2): leaves 4,8,16 (G(3)=1)- Choosing (2,4): leaves 1,8,16 (G(1) and G(2)=1, so G(1) XOR G(2)=1)- Choosing (4,8): leaves 1,2,16 (G(2)=1 and G(1)=0, so G(2) XOR G(1)=1)- Choosing (8,16): leaves 1,2,4 (G(3)=1)So, the Grundy numbers reachable are {1,1,1,1} = {1}. Therefore, mex is 0. So, G(5)=0.Wait, that seems interesting. G(5)=0.G(6): As we started earlier, let's compute it.Possible moves:- Choosing (1,2): leaves 4,8,16,32 (G(4)=2)- Choosing (2,4): leaves 1,8,16,32 (G(1)=0 and G(3)=1, so G(1) XOR G(3)=1)- Choosing (4,8): leaves 1,2,16,32 (G(2)=1 and G(2)=1, so G(2) XOR G(2)=0)- Choosing (8,16): leaves 1,2,4,32 (G(3)=1 and G(1)=0, so G(3) XOR G(1)=1)- Choosing (16,32): leaves 1,2,4,8 (G(4)=2)So, the Grundy numbers reachable are {2,1,0,1,2} = {0,1,2}. Therefore, mex is 3. So, G(6)=3.Wait, so G(6)=3.Now, let's summarize the Grundy numbers we have so far:- G(1)=0- G(2)=1- G(3)=1- G(4)=2- G(5)=0- G(6)=3Hmm, interesting pattern. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula.Looking at the Grundy numbers:n : 1 2 3 4 5 6G(n):0 1 1 2 0 3It doesn't seem to follow a simple pattern like binary representations or something. Maybe it's periodic or follows another rule.But since we only need up to G(6) for the first chain, and the other chains are shorter, maybe we can compute the Grundy numbers for all chains and then XOR them to find the overall Grundy number.Let's list all the chains and their lengths:1. Chain 1: 6 elements (1,2,4,8,16,32) -> G(6)=32. Chain 2: 5 elements (3,6,12,24,48) -> G(5)=03. Chain 3: 4 elements (5,10,20,40) -> G(4)=24. Chain 4: 3 elements (7,14,28) -> G(3)=15. Chain 5: 3 elements (9,18,36) -> G(3)=16. Chain 6: 3 elements (11,22,44) -> G(3)=17. Chain 7: 2 elements (13,26) -> G(2)=18. Chain 8: 2 elements (15,30) -> G(2)=19. Chain 9: 2 elements (17,34) -> G(2)=110. Chain 10: 2 elements (19,38) -> G(2)=111. Chain 11: 2 elements (21,42) -> G(2)=112. Chain 12: 2 elements (23,46) -> G(2)=113. Chain 13: 2 elements (25,50) -> G(2)=1So, the Grundy numbers for each chain are:3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1Now, let's compute the XOR of all these Grundy numbers.Start with 3.3 XOR 0 = 33 XOR 2 = 11 XOR 1 = 00 XOR 1 = 11 XOR 1 = 00 XOR 1 = 11 XOR 1 = 00 XOR 1 = 11 XOR 1 = 00 XOR 1 = 11 XOR 1 = 00 XOR 1 = 1So, after XORing all Grundy numbers, the result is 1.Since the overall Grundy number is non-zero (1), the first player (Seth) has a winning strategy.Therefore, Seth can win with optimal play."},{"question":"Consider the expression frac{sqrt{a^2+x^2}-frac{x^2-ba^2}{sqrt{a^2+x^2}}+b}{a^2+x^2+b^2}.

First, I should focus on simplifying the numerator because it looks a bit complicated with the square roots and fractions. The numerator is:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]I notice that the first term is (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}) and the second term has the same denominator (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}). Maybe I can combine these two terms by getting a common denominator. So, let me rewrite the first term as:[frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2} cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Because (sqrt{a^2 + x^2} cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 + x^2), right? So that becomes:[frac{a^2 + x^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Now, the numerator of the entire expression becomes:[frac{a^2 + x^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Since the first two terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:[frac{a^2 + x^2 - (x^2 - ba^2)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Let me simplify the numerator inside the fraction:[a^2 + x^2 - x^2 + ba^2 = a^2 + ba^2 = a^2(1 + b)]So now, the numerator is:[frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Wait, I still have that \\"+ b\\" term outside the fraction. I need to combine this with the fraction. To do that, I can write \\"b\\" as:[frac{b cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]So now, the entire numerator becomes:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, that doesn't look much simpler. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.Wait, when I combined the first two terms, I had:[frac{a^2 + x^2 - (x^2 - ba^2)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2 + x^2 - x^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Then, adding the \\"+ b\\" term:[frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Maybe I can factor out (1 + b) from the numerator? Let's see:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{(1 + b)(a^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should consider another approach. Let me try multiplying numerator and denominator by (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}) to eliminate the square roots in the numerator.So, the entire expression becomes:[frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2} times frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Multiplying numerator and denominator:Numerator:[(sqrt{a^2 + x^2})^2 - (x^2 - ba^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]Denominator:[(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]Simplify the numerator:[(a^2 + x^2) - x^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]So, the expression is now:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can factor out (1 + b) from the numerator:[frac{(1 + b)(a^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Wait, maybe I can factor out \\"b\\" from the second term:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Maybe I should look for another strategy. Let me try to combine the terms in the numerator differently.Original numerator:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Let me write all terms over the common denominator (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}):[frac{(a^2 + x^2) - (x^2 - ba^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Simplify numerator inside the fraction:[(a^2 + x^2) - x^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]So, the numerator becomes:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Now, the entire expression is:[frac{frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Which can be written as:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, this still seems complicated. Maybe I can factor out something from the numerator. Let's see:[a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]I don't see an obvious factor here. Maybe I can factor out \\"b\\" from the second term:[(1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]Still not helpful. Maybe I should consider the denominator:[(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) cdot sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]I wonder if the numerator can be expressed in terms of the denominator. Let me see:If I factor out (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}) from the numerator:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} cdot left( frac{a^2(1 + b)}{a^2 + x^2} + b right)]Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can write the numerator as:[a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try plugging in some values for a, x, and b to see if I can spot a pattern or verify which option is correct.Let me choose simple values: let a = 1, x = 0, b = 1.Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{1 + 0} - frac{0 - 1 cdot 1}{sqrt{1 + 0}} + 1 = 1 - frac{-1}{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3]Denominator:[1 + 0 + 1 = 2]So, the expression becomes 3/2.Now, let's check the options with a=1, x=0, b=1:A. (1 + 1)/(1 + 0)^{3/2} = 2/1 = 2 ≠ 3/2B. 1/(1 + 0 + 1) = 1/2 ≠ 3/2C. (1 + 1)/sqrt{(1 + 0)(1 + 0 + 1)} = 2/sqrt{1 * 2} = 2/sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414 ≠ 3/2D. (2 + 2)/sqrt{1 + 0 + 1} = 4/sqrt{2} = 2*sqrt{2} ≈ 2.828 ≠ 3/2E. 1/(1 + 0 + 1) = 1/2 ≠ 3/2Hmm, none of the options give 3/2 when a=1, x=0, b=1. That's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.Wait, let me recalculate the original expression with a=1, x=0, b=1:Numerator:[sqrt{1 + 0} - frac{0 - 1*1}{sqrt{1 + 0}} + 1 = 1 - frac{-1}{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3]Denominator:[1 + 0 + 1 = 2]So, 3/2 is correct. But none of the options give 3/2. Maybe I need to try another set of values.Let me try a=1, x=1, b=0.Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{1 + 1} - frac{1 - 0}{sqrt{1 + 1}} + 0 = sqrt{2} - frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]Denominator:[1 + 1 + 0 = 2]So, the expression becomes (frac{sqrt{2}/2}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}).Now, check the options with a=1, x=1, b=0:A. (0 + 1)/(1 + 1)^{3/2} = 1/(2)^{3/2} = 1/(2*sqrt{2}) = sqrt{2}/4 ≈ 0.3535B. 1/(1 + 1 + 0) = 1/2 = 0.5C. (1 + 0)/sqrt{(1 + 1)(1 + 1 + 0)} = 1/sqrt{2*2} = 1/2 = 0.5D. (2 + 0)/sqrt{1 + 1 + 0} = 2/sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414E. 0/(1 + 1 + 0) = 0So, option A gives sqrt{2}/4, which matches our result. But earlier, with a=1, x=0, b=1, none matched. Maybe option A is correct? But let's check another set.Let me try a=1, x=0, b=0.Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{1 + 0} - frac{0 - 0}{sqrt{1 + 0}} + 0 = 1 - 0 + 0 = 1]Denominator:[1 + 0 + 0 = 1]So, the expression is 1/1 = 1.Check options with a=1, x=0, b=0:A. (0 + 1)/(1 + 0)^{3/2} = 1/1 = 1B. 1/(1 + 0 + 0) = 1C. (1 + 0)/sqrt{(1 + 0)(1 + 0 + 0)} = 1/sqrt{1*1} = 1D. (2 + 0)/sqrt{1 + 0 + 0} = 2/1 = 2E. 0/(1 + 0 + 0) = 0So, options A, B, and C all give 1. Hmm, that's not helpful.Let me try another set: a=1, x=1, b=1.Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{1 + 1} - frac{1 - 1*1}{sqrt{1 + 1}} + 1 = sqrt{2} - frac{0}{sqrt{2}} + 1 = sqrt{2} + 1 ≈ 1.414 + 1 = 2.414]Denominator:[1 + 1 + 1 = 3]So, the expression is approximately 2.414/3 ≈ 0.8047.Check options with a=1, x=1, b=1:A. (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)^{3/2} = 2/(2)^{3/2} = 2/(2*sqrt{2}) = 1/sqrt{2} ≈ 0.7071B. 1/(1 + 1 + 1) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333C. (1 + 1)/sqrt{(1 + 1)(1 + 1 + 1)} = 2/sqrt{2*3} = 2/sqrt{6} ≈ 0.8165D. (2 + 2)/sqrt{1 + 1 + 1} = 4/sqrt{3} ≈ 2.3094E. 1/(1 + 1 + 1) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333The original expression was approximately 0.8047. Option C is approximately 0.8165, which is close but not exact. Option A is 0.7071, which is further off. Maybe the exact value is different.Wait, let's calculate the exact value:Numerator:[sqrt{2} + 1]Denominator:[3]So, the expression is (frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{3}).Option C is:[frac{2}{sqrt{6}} = frac{2sqrt{6}}{6} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} ≈ 0.8165]But (frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{3} ≈ frac{1.414 + 1}{3} ≈ 0.8047), which is slightly less than option C. So, option C is not exactly equal.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me try to manipulate the original expression algebraically.Original expression:[frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Let me combine the first two terms in the numerator:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{(a^2 + x^2) - (x^2 - ba^2)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2 + x^2 - x^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]So, the numerator becomes:[frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b]Now, the entire expression is:[frac{frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Let me write \\"b\\" as (frac{b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}) to have a common denominator:[frac{frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Which simplifies to:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can factor out (1 + b) from the numerator:[frac{(1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]I don't see an obvious way to simplify this further. Maybe I should consider the denominator:[(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]I wonder if the numerator can be expressed as a multiple of the denominator. Let me see:If I factor out (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}) from the numerator:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} left( frac{a^2(1 + b)}{a^2 + x^2} + b right)]But that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write the numerator as:[a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me try to rationalize the numerator or denominator.Wait, another idea: maybe I can write the entire expression as:[frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2} = frac{sqrt{a^2 + x^2} + b - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Let me combine the first two terms:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2} + b = frac{(a^2 + x^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]So, the numerator becomes:[frac{(a^2 + x^2) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2 + x^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} - x^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{a^2 + ba^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Which is the same as before. So, I'm back to the same point.Maybe I should consider that the answer is option C, as it seems to have the right structure with the product of square roots in the denominator. Let me check:Option C:[frac{1 + b}{sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)(a^2 + x^2 + b^2)}}]If I multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt{a^2 + x^2}), I get:[frac{(1 + b)sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2)(a^2 + x^2 + b^2)}]But our expression is:[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Hmm, not quite the same. Maybe I need to manipulate it differently.Wait, let me factor out (1 + b) from the numerator:[frac{(1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{(1 + b)a^2}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + frac{b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Simplify each term:First term:[frac{(1 + b)a^2}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{(1 + b)a^2}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Second term:[frac{b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = frac{b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]So, the expression becomes:[frac{(1 + b)a^2}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} + frac{b}{a^2 + x^2 + b^2}]Hmm, still not matching any of the options directly. Maybe I need to find a common denominator for these two terms:The common denominator would be ((a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}). So, the expression becomes:[frac{(1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{(a^2 + x^2 + b^2) sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}]Which is where I started. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should accept that option C is the closest, even though my earlier test case didn't match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my test case calculations.Wait, let me re-examine the test case where a=1, x=1, b=1:Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{2} + 1 ≈ 2.414]Denominator:[3]So, 2.414/3 ≈ 0.8047Option C:[frac{2}{sqrt{2 cdot 3}} = frac{2}{sqrt{6}} ≈ 0.8165]The difference is about 0.0118, which is small but noticeable. Maybe it's due to rounding errors. Let me calculate more precisely:[sqrt{2} ≈ 1.41421356]So, numerator:[1.41421356 + 1 = 2.41421356]Divide by 3:[2.41421356 / 3 ≈ 0.80473785]Option C:[2 / sqrt{6} ≈ 2 / 2.44948974 ≈ 0.81649658]The difference is about 0.01175873. That's more than just rounding; it's a significant difference. So, option C doesn't match exactly.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the original expression. Let me try a different approach.Let me denote ( S = a^2 + x^2 ). Then, the expression becomes:[frac{sqrt{S} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{S}} + b}{S + b^2}]Simplify the numerator:[sqrt{S} - frac{x^2 - ba^2}{sqrt{S}} + b = frac{S - (x^2 - ba^2)}{sqrt{S}} + b = frac{S - x^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{S}} + b]But ( S = a^2 + x^2 ), so ( S - x^2 = a^2 ). Therefore:[frac{a^2 + ba^2}{sqrt{S}} + b = frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{S}} + b]So, the expression is:[frac{frac{a^2(1 + b)}{sqrt{S}} + b}{S + b^2}]Let me write \\"b\\" as (frac{b sqrt{S}}{sqrt{S}}):[frac{frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{S}}{sqrt{S}}}{S + b^2} = frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{S}}{sqrt{S}(S + b^2)}]Now, substitute back ( S = a^2 + x^2 ):[frac{a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + x^2}(a^2 + x^2 + b^2)}]Hmm, this is the same as before. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the answer is option C, as it's the only one that has the product of square roots in the denominator, which seems to match the structure of our simplified expression.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as:[a^2(1 + b) + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]And the denominator as:[sqrt{a^2 + x^2}(a^2 + x^2 + b^2)]I can factor out (1 + b) from the numerator:[(1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (1 + b)a^2 + b sqrt{a^2 + x^2}]But I don't see a way to factor this further. Maybe I should accept that option C is the closest match, even though my test cases didn't perfectly align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my test case calculations.Wait, let me try another test case: a=2, x=0, b=1.Original expression:Numerator:[sqrt{4 + 0} - frac{0 - 1*4}{sqrt{4 + 0}} + 1 = 2 - frac{-4}{2} + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5]Denominator:[4 + 0 + 1 = 5]So, the expression is 5/5 = 1.Check options with a=2, x=0, b=1:A.

What is the minimum number of students in the band?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a school band can arrange themselves in rows of 6, 7, or 8 with no one left over. I need to find the minimum number of students in the band. Hmm, let's see. I think this has something to do with multiples because they're arranging themselves in rows without leftovers. So, maybe it's about finding a common multiple of 6, 7, and 8. But which one? The least common multiple, I guess, because we want the smallest number of students that can do this.Alright, let me start by recalling what a multiple is. A multiple of a number is just that number multiplied by an integer. So, multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, and so on. Similarly, multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, etc., and multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, and so forth. Now, I need to find a number that appears in all three lists because that would mean it's a multiple of each of these numbers.Let me list out some multiples for each:Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, ...Multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, ...Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136, 144, 152, 160, 168, ...Now, I need to find the smallest number that appears in all three lists. Looking at the multiples of 6, 7, and 8, I can see that 168 is the first number that appears in all three lists. So, 168 seems to be the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 7, and 8.But wait, is there a smaller number that I might have missed? Let me check the multiples again. Before 168, the multiples of 6 and 8 both have 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, but none of these are multiples of 7. Similarly, multiples of 7 and 8 have 56, 112, 168, but 56 and 112 aren't multiples of 6. So, yes, 168 is indeed the smallest number that is a multiple of all three.Alternatively, I remember that there's a method to find the LCM using prime factors. Let me try that to confirm. First, I'll find the prime factors of each number:- 6 can be factored into 2 × 3.- 7 is a prime number, so its prime factor is just 7.- 8 can be factored into 2 × 2 × 2, which is 2³.To find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:- For 2, the highest power is 2³ from 8.- For 3, the highest power is 3¹ from 6.- For 7, the highest power is 7¹ from 7.Now, multiply these together: 2³ × 3 × 7 = 8 × 3 × 7 = 24 × 7 = 168.So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the band is 168."},{"question":"A class has 50 students. The scores X of a math exam follow a normal distribution N(110, 10^2). It is known that P(100 leqslant X leqslant 110) = 0.34. Estimate the number of students with a math score of 120 or higher.A: 7B: 7C: 8D: 9","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a class with 50 students, and their math exam scores follow a normal distribution, which is given as N(110, 10²). That means the average score is 110, and the standard deviation is 10. They also tell me that the probability of a score being between 100 and 110 is 0.34. I need to estimate how many students scored 120 or higher. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what a normal distribution is. It's a bell-shaped curve where most of the data is around the mean, which is 110 in this case. The standard deviation tells me how spread out the scores are. A standard deviation of 10 means that most students scored within 10 points above or below 110. So, 68% of the students scored between 100 and 120, right? Wait, no, actually, the 68-95-99.7 rule says that about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. So, in this case, 68% of the students scored between 100 and 120.But wait, the problem says that P(100 ≤ X ≤ 110) is 0.34. That makes sense because from the mean to one standard deviation below is 34%, and from the mean to one standard deviation above is another 34%, adding up to 68%. So, the area from 100 to 110 is 34%, and from 110 to 120 is another 34%.Now, they want the number of students who scored 120 or higher. So, that's the tail of the distribution beyond 120. Since the total area under the curve is 1, and the area up to 120 is 0.5 (the mean) plus 0.34 (from 110 to 120), that gives us 0.84. So, the area beyond 120 is 1 - 0.84, which is 0.16. Therefore, 16% of the students scored 120 or higher.But wait, let me double-check that. If the distribution is symmetric, then the probability above 120 should be the same as the probability below 100. Since P(100 ≤ X ≤ 110) is 0.34, then P(X ≤ 100) should be 0.5 - 0.34 = 0.16. So, yes, that confirms it. The probability of scoring 120 or higher is 0.16.Now, applying this to the 50 students, the number of students who scored 120 or higher would be 0.16 multiplied by 50. Let me calculate that: 0.16 * 50 = 8. So, approximately 8 students scored 120 or higher.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Is the probability beyond 120 exactly 0.16? Let me think about the standard normal distribution. If I convert 120 to a z-score, that would be (120 - 110)/10 = 1. So, the z-score is 1. Looking up the z-table, the area to the left of z=1 is about 0.8413, which means the area to the right is 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587, which is approximately 0.16. So, that checks out.Therefore, 0.16 * 50 is indeed 8. So, the number of students with a math score of 120 or higher is 8.Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options are A:7, B:7, C:8, D:9. So, 8 is an option, which is C. So, I think that's the correct answer.But just to be thorough, let me go through the steps again. The mean is 110, standard deviation is 10. The probability between 100 and 110 is 0.34, which is one standard deviation below the mean. Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability between 110 and 120 is also 0.34. Therefore, the probability above 120 is 0.5 - 0.34 = 0.16. Multiplying that by 50 students gives 8 students. Yep, that seems right.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing the symmetry of the normal distribution and understanding how the probabilities relate to the standard deviations. So, I feel confident that the answer is 8, which is option C."},{"question":"Emily observes a boat sailing at a consistent speed along a direct section of a river.

Determine the length of the boat in terms of Emily's equal steps.textbf{(A) }70qquadtextbf{(B) }83qquadtextbf{(C) }95qquadtextbf{(D) }110qquadtextbf{(E) }125","answer":"Okay, so Emily is walking along a riverbank, and she sees a boat moving at a constant speed. She decides to walk parallel to the riverbank, and her speed is faster than the boat's speed. When she walks from the back of the boat to the front, she counts 250 equal steps. Then, when she walks in the opposite direction, from the front to the back, she counts 50 steps. We need to find the length of the boat in terms of Emily's steps.Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think we need to consider the relative speeds of Emily and the boat. Since Emily is walking faster than the boat in both directions, her speed relative to the boat will be different depending on the direction she's walking.Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:- ( L ) is the length of the boat in Emily's steps.- ( E ) is Emily's walking speed in steps per unit time.- ( B ) is the boat's speed in steps per unit time.Wait, actually, since we're dealing with steps, maybe it's better to think in terms of distance rather than speed. Let me try that again.When Emily walks in the same direction as the boat, her effective speed relative to the boat is ( E - B ) because both are moving in the same direction. When she walks against the direction of the boat, her effective speed relative to the boat is ( E + B ) because their speeds add up.But wait, the problem says she counts 250 steps when walking from the back to the front, and 50 steps when walking from the front to the back. So, the number of steps she takes is related to the time it takes for her to cover the length of the boat relative to the boat's movement.Let me think. When she walks from the back to the front, she's moving in the same direction as the boat. So, the time it takes her to cover the length of the boat is the time it takes for her to walk 250 steps. Similarly, when she walks against the boat's direction, the time it takes her to cover the length of the boat is the time it takes for her to walk 50 steps.Wait, but her speed is different in each direction. The problem says she walks faster than the boat in both directions, but slightly slower when walking back. So, her speed when walking back is still faster than the boat but slower than her initial speed.Hmm, maybe I need to consider her speeds in each direction. Let me denote:- ( E_1 ) as her speed when walking from the back to the front.- ( E_2 ) as her speed when walking from the front to the back.Given that ( E_1 > B ) and ( E_2 > B ), but ( E_2 < E_1 ).So, when she walks from the back to the front, her relative speed with respect to the boat is ( E_1 - B ). The time taken to cover the length of the boat is ( t_1 = frac{L}{E_1 - B} ). During this time, she takes 250 steps, so the distance she walks is ( E_1 times t_1 = 250 ) steps.Similarly, when she walks from the front to the back, her relative speed is ( E_2 + B ). The time taken is ( t_2 = frac{L}{E_2 + B} ). During this time, she takes 50 steps, so the distance she walks is ( E_2 times t_2 = 50 ) steps.So, we have two equations:1. ( E_1 times frac{L}{E_1 - B} = 250 )2. ( E_2 times frac{L}{E_2 + B} = 50 )We need to solve for ( L ).But we have three variables here: ( E_1 ), ( E_2 ), and ( B ). We need another equation or a way to relate these variables.Wait, the problem says that in both cases, she is walking faster than the boat, but her speed is slightly slower when walking back. So, ( E_2 < E_1 ), but both are greater than ( B ).Is there a way to express ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) in terms of each other or relate them somehow?Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the time taken for each walk is the same? Wait, no, because she's taking different numbers of steps, so the time must be different.Wait, let's think about the time taken in each case.When she walks from the back to the front, she takes 250 steps, so the time is ( t_1 = frac{250}{E_1} ).Similarly, when she walks from the front to the back, she takes 50 steps, so the time is ( t_2 = frac{50}{E_2} ).But during these times, the boat is also moving. So, the distance the boat moves during ( t_1 ) is ( B times t_1 ), and during ( t_2 ) is ( B times t_2 ).When she walks from the back to the front, she has to cover the length of the boat plus the distance the boat moves during ( t_1 ). So, the distance she walks is ( L + B times t_1 ), which equals ( E_1 times t_1 ).Similarly, when she walks from the front to the back, she has to cover the length of the boat minus the distance the boat moves during ( t_2 ). So, the distance she walks is ( L - B times t_2 ), which equals ( E_2 times t_2 ).So, we have:1. ( E_1 times t_1 = L + B times t_1 )2. ( E_2 times t_2 = L - B times t_2 )But ( t_1 = frac{250}{E_1} ) and ( t_2 = frac{50}{E_2} ).Substituting ( t_1 ) into the first equation:( E_1 times frac{250}{E_1} = L + B times frac{250}{E_1} )Simplifying:( 250 = L + frac{250B}{E_1} )Similarly, substituting ( t_2 ) into the second equation:( E_2 times frac{50}{E_2} = L - B times frac{50}{E_2} )Simplifying:( 50 = L - frac{50B}{E_2} )So now we have two equations:1. ( 250 = L + frac{250B}{E_1} )  --> Let's call this Equation (1)2. ( 50 = L - frac{50B}{E_2} )   --> Let's call this Equation (2)We need to solve for ( L ). But we still have ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) in the equations. Is there a way to relate ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 )?The problem says that when she walks in the opposite direction, her speed is still faster than the boat but slightly slower than her initial speed. So, ( E_2 < E_1 ), but both ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) are greater than ( B ).Is there any other information we can use? Maybe the fact that her step size is the same in both directions, so the distance she covers per step is the same.Wait, but we're already considering steps as units of distance, so maybe we don't need to worry about that.Alternatively, perhaps we can express ( frac{B}{E_1} ) and ( frac{B}{E_2} ) in terms of ( L ).From Equation (1):( frac{250B}{E_1} = 250 - L )So, ( frac{B}{E_1} = 1 - frac{L}{250} ) --> Let's call this Equation (3)From Equation (2):( frac{50B}{E_2} = L - 50 )So, ( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{L - 50}{50} ) --> Let's call this Equation (4)Now, we have expressions for ( frac{B}{E_1} ) and ( frac{B}{E_2} ).But we need another relation between ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ). The problem says that when she walks back, her speed is slightly slower than her initial speed. So, ( E_2 = k times E_1 ), where ( k ) is a constant less than 1.But we don't know the value of ( k ). Hmm, this seems tricky.Wait, maybe we can assume that the ratio of her speeds is related to the number of steps she takes. Since she takes 250 steps in one direction and 50 in the other, maybe the ratio of her speeds is 5:1? But that might not necessarily be true because the time taken is different.Alternatively, perhaps we can express ( E_2 ) in terms of ( E_1 ) using the fact that she's walking slightly slower. But without more information, it's hard to quantify \\"slightly slower.\\"Wait, maybe we can consider that the time taken for each walk is different, but the distance she covers relative to the boat is the same, which is the length of the boat.Wait, let's think differently. Let's denote ( t_1 ) as the time taken to walk from the back to the front, and ( t_2 ) as the time taken to walk from the front to the back.We have:1. ( E_1 times t_1 = L + B times t_1 )2. ( E_2 times t_2 = L - B times t_2 )From the first equation:( E_1 times t_1 - B times t_1 = L )( t_1 (E_1 - B) = L )( t_1 = frac{L}{E_1 - B} )From the second equation:( E_2 times t_2 + B times t_2 = L )( t_2 (E_2 + B) = L )( t_2 = frac{L}{E_2 + B} )We also know that the number of steps she takes is equal to her speed multiplied by the time:1. ( E_1 times t_1 = 250 )2. ( E_2 times t_2 = 50 )So, substituting ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ):1. ( E_1 times frac{L}{E_1 - B} = 250 )2. ( E_2 times frac{L}{E_2 + B} = 50 )These are the same equations we had before. So, we need to find ( L ) in terms of ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ), but we don't have values for ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ).Wait, maybe we can express ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) in terms of ( L ) and ( B ), and then find a relationship between them.From Equation (1):( E_1 = frac{250 (E_1 - B)}{L} )( E_1 L = 250 E_1 - 250 B )( E_1 L - 250 E_1 = -250 B )( E_1 (L - 250) = -250 B )( E_1 = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )Similarly, from Equation (2):( E_2 = frac{50 (E_2 + B)}{L} )( E_2 L = 50 E_2 + 50 B )( E_2 L - 50 E_2 = 50 B )( E_2 (L - 50) = 50 B )( E_2 = frac{50 B}{L - 50} )Now, we have expressions for ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) in terms of ( B ) and ( L ).Since ( E_2 < E_1 ), we can write:( frac{50 B}{L - 50} < frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )But ( B ) is positive, so we can divide both sides by ( B ):( frac{50}{L - 50} < frac{-250}{L - 250} )Multiply both sides by ( (L - 50)(L - 250) ). But we need to be careful about the sign of this product.Assuming ( L > 250 ), then ( L - 50 > 200 ) and ( L - 250 > 0 ), so the product is positive. Therefore, the inequality remains the same when multiplying:( 50 (L - 250) < -250 (L - 50) )Simplify:( 50L - 12500 < -250L + 12500 )Bring all terms to one side:( 50L + 250L < 12500 + 12500 )( 300L < 25000 )( L < frac{25000}{300} )( L < frac{250}{3} )( L < 83.overline{3} )But wait, this contradicts our assumption that ( L > 250 ). So, our assumption must be wrong.Therefore, ( L ) cannot be greater than 250. Let's consider ( L < 250 ).If ( L < 250 ), then ( L - 250 ) is negative, and ( L - 50 ) could be positive or negative depending on ( L ).If ( L > 50 ), then ( L - 50 ) is positive, and ( L - 250 ) is negative. So, the product ( (L - 50)(L - 250) ) is negative.Therefore, when we multiply both sides of the inequality ( frac{50}{L - 50} < frac{-250}{L - 250} ) by a negative number, the inequality sign flips:( 50 (L - 250) > -250 (L - 50) )Simplify:( 50L - 12500 > -250L + 12500 )Bring all terms to one side:( 50L + 250L > 12500 + 12500 )( 300L > 25000 )( L > frac{25000}{300} )( L > frac{250}{3} )( L > 83.overline{3} )So, combining this with our earlier consideration, ( L ) must be greater than 83.33 but less than 250.But wait, the answer choices are 70, 83, 95, 110, 125. So, 83.33 is approximately 83, which is one of the options.But let's see if we can find the exact value.We have:From Equation (1):( 250 = L + frac{250B}{E_1} )From Equation (2):( 50 = L - frac{50B}{E_2} )We also have expressions for ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ):( E_1 = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )( E_2 = frac{50 B}{L - 50} )Let me plug ( E_1 ) into Equation (1):( 250 = L + frac{250B}{frac{-250 B}{L - 250}} )Simplify the denominator:( frac{250B}{frac{-250 B}{L - 250}} = frac{250B times (L - 250)}{-250 B} = -(L - 250) )So, Equation (1) becomes:( 250 = L - (L - 250) )( 250 = L - L + 250 )( 250 = 250 )Hmm, that's just an identity, which doesn't help us find ( L ).Similarly, let's plug ( E_2 ) into Equation (2):( 50 = L - frac{50B}{frac{50 B}{L - 50}} )Simplify the denominator:( frac{50B}{frac{50 B}{L - 50}} = frac{50B times (L - 50)}{50 B} = (L - 50) )So, Equation (2) becomes:( 50 = L - (L - 50) )( 50 = L - L + 50 )( 50 = 50 )Again, just an identity. So, this approach isn't giving us new information.Maybe we need to find a ratio between ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ). Let's denote ( E_2 = k E_1 ), where ( k < 1 ).From Equation (3):( frac{B}{E_1} = 1 - frac{L}{250} )From Equation (4):( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{L - 50}{50} )But ( E_2 = k E_1 ), so ( frac{B}{k E_1} = frac{L - 50}{50} )From Equation (3):( frac{B}{E_1} = 1 - frac{L}{250} )So, substituting into the above:( frac{1 - frac{L}{250}}{k} = frac{L - 50}{50} )Simplify:( frac{1 - frac{L}{250}}{k} = frac{L - 50}{50} )Multiply both sides by ( k ):( 1 - frac{L}{250} = frac{k (L - 50)}{50} )But we don't know ( k ). However, we can express ( k ) in terms of ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ). Since ( E_2 = k E_1 ), and from the number of steps, we can relate the times.From the number of steps:When walking from back to front, time ( t_1 = frac{250}{E_1} )When walking from front to back, time ( t_2 = frac{50}{E_2} = frac{50}{k E_1} )But during ( t_1 ), the boat moves ( B t_1 ), and during ( t_2 ), the boat moves ( B t_2 ).From the first scenario:( E_1 t_1 = L + B t_1 )( 250 = L + B times frac{250}{E_1} )From the second scenario:( E_2 t_2 = L - B t_2 )( 50 = L - B times frac{50}{E_2} )But ( E_2 = k E_1 ), so:( 50 = L - B times frac{50}{k E_1} )From the first equation, we have:( B times frac{250}{E_1} = 250 - L )( frac{B}{E_1} = 1 - frac{L}{250} )From the second equation:( B times frac{50}{k E_1} = L - 50 )( frac{B}{k E_1} = frac{L - 50}{50} )But ( frac{B}{E_1} = 1 - frac{L}{250} ), so:( frac{1 - frac{L}{250}}{k} = frac{L - 50}{50} )So, we have:( frac{1 - frac{L}{250}}{k} = frac{L - 50}{50} )But we still have two variables, ( L ) and ( k ). We need another equation to relate them.Wait, perhaps we can express ( k ) in terms of the ratio of the times or something else.Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the ratio of the times is related to the ratio of the steps. Since she takes 250 steps in one direction and 50 in the other, the ratio of the times is ( frac{250}{E_1} : frac{50}{E_2} ).But without knowing ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ), it's hard to proceed.Wait, maybe we can consider that the distance she covers relative to the boat is the same in both cases, which is the length of the boat.So, when she walks from the back to the front, the distance she covers relative to the boat is ( L ), and when she walks from the front to the back, it's also ( L ).But in the first case, she's moving in the same direction as the boat, so her relative speed is ( E_1 - B ), and in the second case, her relative speed is ( E_2 + B ).So, the time taken in the first case is ( frac{L}{E_1 - B} ), and the time taken in the second case is ( frac{L}{E_2 + B} ).But we also know that the number of steps she takes is equal to her walking speed multiplied by the time.So:1. ( E_1 times frac{L}{E_1 - B} = 250 )2. ( E_2 times frac{L}{E_2 + B} = 50 )These are the same equations we had earlier.Let me try to solve these equations simultaneously.From the first equation:( E_1 times frac{L}{E_1 - B} = 250 )( frac{E_1 L}{E_1 - B} = 250 )( E_1 L = 250 (E_1 - B) )( E_1 L = 250 E_1 - 250 B )( E_1 (L - 250) = -250 B )( E_1 = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )From the second equation:( E_2 times frac{L}{E_2 + B} = 50 )( frac{E_2 L}{E_2 + B} = 50 )( E_2 L = 50 (E_2 + B) )( E_2 L = 50 E_2 + 50 B )( E_2 (L - 50) = 50 B )( E_2 = frac{50 B}{L - 50} )Now, we have expressions for ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) in terms of ( B ) and ( L ).Since ( E_2 = k E_1 ), where ( k < 1 ), we can write:( frac{50 B}{L - 50} = k times frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )Simplify:( frac{50}{L - 50} = k times frac{-250}{L - 250} )Divide both sides by 50:( frac{1}{L - 50} = k times frac{-5}{L - 250} )So,( frac{1}{L - 50} = frac{-5k}{L - 250} )Cross-multiplying:( L - 250 = -5k (L - 50) )But we still have two variables, ( L ) and ( k ). We need another equation to relate them.Wait, maybe we can express ( k ) in terms of the ratio of the steps. Since she takes 250 steps in one direction and 50 in the other, the ratio of the times is ( frac{250}{E_1} : frac{50}{E_2} ).But ( E_2 = k E_1 ), so the ratio becomes ( frac{250}{E_1} : frac{50}{k E_1} = frac{250}{E_1} : frac{50}{k E_1} = 250 : frac{50}{k} = 5k : 1 )So, the ratio of the times is ( 5k : 1 ).But the times are also related to the distances she covers relative to the boat, which is the same ( L ).Wait, the time taken to cover ( L ) at relative speed ( E_1 - B ) is ( frac{L}{E_1 - B} ), and the time taken to cover ( L ) at relative speed ( E_2 + B ) is ( frac{L}{E_2 + B} ).So, the ratio of the times is ( frac{L}{E_1 - B} : frac{L}{E_2 + B} = frac{1}{E_1 - B} : frac{1}{E_2 + B} = frac{E_2 + B}{E_1 - B} )But we also have the ratio of the times as ( 5k : 1 ).So,( frac{E_2 + B}{E_1 - B} = 5k )But ( E_2 = k E_1 ), so:( frac{k E_1 + B}{E_1 - B} = 5k )Let me substitute ( E_1 = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} ) and ( E_2 = frac{50 B}{L - 50} ) into this equation.First, express ( E_2 + B ):( E_2 + B = frac{50 B}{L - 50} + B = B left( frac{50}{L - 50} + 1 right) = B left( frac{50 + L - 50}{L - 50} right) = B left( frac{L}{L - 50} right) )Similarly, ( E_1 - B ):( E_1 - B = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} - B = B left( frac{-250}{L - 250} - 1 right) = B left( frac{-250 - (L - 250)}{L - 250} right) = B left( frac{-250 - L + 250}{L - 250} right) = B left( frac{-L}{L - 250} right) )So, the ratio ( frac{E_2 + B}{E_1 - B} ) becomes:( frac{B left( frac{L}{L - 50} right)}{B left( frac{-L}{L - 250} right)} = frac{frac{L}{L - 50}}{frac{-L}{L - 250}} = frac{L}{L - 50} times frac{L - 250}{-L} = frac{L - 250}{-(L - 50)} = frac{250 - L}{L - 50} )So, we have:( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k )But from earlier, we have:( frac{1}{L - 50} = frac{-5k}{L - 250} )Which can be rewritten as:( frac{1}{L - 50} = frac{5k}{250 - L} )So,( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k )Which matches our previous result.So, we have:( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k )But we also have:( frac{1}{L - 50} = frac{5k}{250 - L} )Which is the same as:( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k )So, we're going in circles. Maybe we can solve for ( k ) in terms of ( L ) and substitute back.From ( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k ), we get:( k = frac{250 - L}{5(L - 50)} )Now, recall that ( E_2 = k E_1 ), and we have expressions for ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ):( E_1 = frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )( E_2 = frac{50 B}{L - 50} )So,( frac{50 B}{L - 50} = k times frac{-250 B}{L - 250} )Simplify:( frac{50}{L - 50} = k times frac{-250}{L - 250} )Substitute ( k = frac{250 - L}{5(L - 50)} ):( frac{50}{L - 50} = frac{250 - L}{5(L - 50)} times frac{-250}{L - 250} )Simplify the right side:( frac{250 - L}{5(L - 50)} times frac{-250}{L - 250} = frac{(250 - L)(-250)}{5(L - 50)(L - 250)} )Note that ( 250 - L = -(L - 250) ), so:( frac{-(L - 250)(-250)}{5(L - 50)(L - 250)} = frac{250(L - 250)}{5(L - 50)(L - 250)} = frac{250}{5(L - 50)} = frac{50}{L - 50} )So, the right side simplifies to ( frac{50}{L - 50} ), which matches the left side.So, this doesn't give us new information. It seems like we're stuck in a loop.Maybe we need to consider that the length of the boat ( L ) must be an integer, and the answer choices are given. So, perhaps we can test the answer choices to see which one satisfies the equations.Let's try option B, which is 83.Assume ( L = 83 ).From Equation (1):( 250 = 83 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 250 - 83 = 167 )( frac{B}{E_1} = frac{167}{250} approx 0.668 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 83 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 83 - 50 = 33 )( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{33}{50} = 0.66 )Now, from ( E_2 = k E_1 ), we have:( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{B}{k E_1} = frac{1}{k} times frac{B}{E_1} )So,( 0.66 = frac{1}{k} times 0.668 )( k = frac{0.668}{0.66} approx 1.012 )But ( k ) should be less than 1, as ( E_2 < E_1 ). So, this doesn't work.Wait, maybe I made a calculation error.Let me recalculate:From Equation (1):( 250 = 83 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 167 )( frac{B}{E_1} = frac{167}{250} = 0.668 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 83 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 33 )( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{33}{50} = 0.66 )So,( frac{B}{E_2} = 0.66 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.668 )Therefore,( frac{E_2}{E_1} = frac{B / 0.66}{B / 0.668} = frac{0.668}{0.66} approx 1.012 )So, ( E_2 approx 1.012 E_1 ), which contradicts the condition that ( E_2 < E_1 ). Therefore, ( L = 83 ) is not the correct answer.Let's try option C, which is 95.Assume ( L = 95 ).From Equation (1):( 250 = 95 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 155 )( frac{B}{E_1} = frac{155}{250} = 0.62 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 95 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 45 )( frac{B}{E_2} = frac{45}{50} = 0.9 )Now,( frac{B}{E_2} = 0.9 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.62 )So,( frac{E_2}{E_1} = frac{B / 0.9}{B / 0.62} = frac{0.62}{0.9} approx 0.689 )So, ( E_2 approx 0.689 E_1 ), which satisfies ( E_2 < E_1 ). This seems plausible.But let's check if this satisfies the earlier condition when we tested ( L = 83 ).Wait, actually, we need to ensure that the ratio ( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k ) holds.For ( L = 95 ):( frac{250 - 95}{95 - 50} = frac{155}{45} approx 3.444 )So, ( 5k approx 3.444 ), which means ( k approx 0.689 ), which matches our earlier calculation.So, this seems consistent.Therefore, the length of the boat is 95 steps.Wait, but let me double-check.From Equation (1):( 250 = 95 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 155 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.62 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 95 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 45 )( frac{B}{E_2} = 0.9 )So,( frac{E_2}{E_1} = frac{0.62}{0.9} approx 0.689 )Which is less than 1, as required.Therefore, the length of the boat is 95 steps.But wait, the answer choices include 83 and 95. Since 83 didn't work, and 95 works, but let me check if 125 works.Assume ( L = 125 ).From Equation (1):( 250 = 125 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 125 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.5 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 125 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 75 )( frac{B}{E_2} = 1.5 )But ( frac{B}{E_2} = 1.5 ) implies ( E_2 = frac{B}{1.5} ), which is less than ( B ), but the problem states that Emily's speed is faster than the boat's speed in both directions. So, ( E_2 > B ), but here ( E_2 = frac{B}{1.5} < B ), which contradicts the condition. Therefore, ( L = 125 ) is invalid.Similarly, let's check ( L = 70 ).From Equation (1):( 250 = 70 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 180 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.72 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 70 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 20 )( frac{B}{E_2} = 0.4 )So,( frac{E_2}{E_1} = frac{0.72}{0.4} = 1.8 )Which means ( E_2 = 1.8 E_1 ), contradicting ( E_2 < E_1 ). So, ( L = 70 ) is invalid.Finally, let's check ( L = 110 ).From Equation (1):( 250 = 110 + frac{250B}{E_1} )( frac{250B}{E_1} = 140 )( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.56 )From Equation (2):( 50 = 110 - frac{50B}{E_2} )( frac{50B}{E_2} = 60 )( frac{B}{E_2} = 1.2 )So,( frac{E_2}{E_1} = frac{0.56}{1.2} approx 0.467 )Which is less than 1, so ( E_2 < E_1 ). But let's check if this satisfies the earlier condition.From ( frac{250 - L}{L - 50} = 5k ):( frac{250 - 110}{110 - 50} = frac{140}{60} approx 2.333 )So, ( 5k approx 2.333 ), which means ( k approx 0.467 ), which matches our earlier calculation.But wait, when we tested ( L = 95 ), it also worked. So, how do we decide between 95 and 110?Wait, let's see. When ( L = 95 ):From Equation (1):( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.62 )From Equation (2):( frac{B}{E_2} = 0.9 )So,( E_2 = frac{B}{0.9} approx 1.111 B )And,( E_1 = frac{B}{0.62} approx 1.613 B )So, ( E_2 = 1.111 B ) and ( E_1 = 1.613 B ), so ( E_2 < E_1 ), which is correct.When ( L = 110 ):From Equation (1):( frac{B}{E_1} = 0.56 )From Equation (2):( frac{B}{E_2} = 1.2 )So,( E_2 = frac{B}{1.2} approx 0.833 B )And,( E_1 = frac{B}{0.56} approx 1.786 B )So, ( E_2 = 0.833 B ) and ( E_1 = 1.786 B ), so ( E_2 < E_1 ), which is correct.But wait, in the case of ( L = 110 ), ( E_2 = 0.833 B ), which is less than ( B ), but the problem states that Emily's speed is faster than the boat's speed in both directions. So, ( E_2 > B ), but here ( E_2 = 0.833 B < B ), which contradicts the condition.Therefore, ( L = 110 ) is invalid.So, the only valid answer is ( L = 95 ).Wait, but earlier when I tested ( L = 95 ), I found that ( E_2 = 0.689 E_1 ), which is less than ( E_1 ), and both ( E_1 ) and ( E_2 ) are greater than ( B ), since ( E_1 = 1.613 B ) and ( E_2 = 1.111 B ), both greater than ( B ).Therefore, the correct answer is 95."},{"question":"The sum of two numbers is 40. Their difference is 12. Find the numbers.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the sum of two numbers is 40 and their difference is 12. I need to find the two numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that when dealing with two numbers and their sum and difference, it's often helpful to set up a system of equations. Let me assign variables to these numbers. Let's call the first number x and the second number y. So, according to the problem, the sum of these two numbers is 40. That gives me the first equation:x + y = 40Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the problem also says that their difference is 12. I need to decide which number is larger because the difference could be positive or negative depending on the order. Since the problem doesn't specify which one is larger, I'll assume that x is larger than y. So, the difference equation would be:x - y = 12Now I have a system of two equations:1. x + y = 402. x - y = 12I need to solve this system to find the values of x and y. There are a couple of methods to solve such systems: substitution and elimination. I think elimination might be quicker here because the equations are already set up in a way that adding or subtracting them could eliminate one of the variables.Let me try adding the two equations together. If I add the left sides and the right sides:(x + y) + (x - y) = 40 + 12Simplifying the left side:x + y + x - y = 2xAnd the right side:40 + 12 = 52So now I have:2x = 52To solve for x, I can divide both sides by 2:2x / 2 = 52 / 2x = 26Okay, so I found that x is 26. Now I need to find y. I can substitute this value of x back into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:x + y = 40Substituting x = 26:26 + y = 40To solve for y, I'll subtract 26 from both sides:y = 40 - 26y = 14So, y is 14. Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If x is 26 and y is 14, then their sum should be 40:26 + 14 = 40Yes, that's correct. And their difference should be 12:26 - 14 = 12That also checks out. So, the two numbers are 26 and 14.Wait a second, what if I had assumed y was larger instead of x? Let me see. If y were larger, then the difference equation would be y - x = 12. Let's try that approach to confirm.Starting again with:x + y = 40y - x = 12If I add these two equations:(x + y) + (y - x) = 40 + 12Simplifying the left side:x + y + y - x = 2yAnd the right side:40 + 12 = 52So now I have:2y = 52Dividing both sides by 2:y = 26Then substituting back into x + y = 40:x + 26 = 40x = 40 - 26x = 14So, in this case, y is 26 and x is 14. Wait, that's just swapping the values. So, regardless of which variable I assign as larger, I end up with the same two numbers: 26 and 14. Therefore, my initial solution was correct.I think I've got it. The two numbers are 26 and 14. To recap, by setting up the system of equations and using elimination, I was able to solve for both variables and confirm that the solution satisfies both the sum and difference conditions given in the problem."},{"question":"Randomly select elements m and n (which can be the same) from the set {1, 2, cdots, 100}. What is the probability that the unit digit of 2^{m} + 3^{n} is 3?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this probability problem here where I need to find the probability that the units digit of (2^m + 3^n) is 3. Both (m) and (n) are selected randomly from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 100}). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that the units digit of powers cycles in a pattern. For example, powers of 2 cycle every 4 numbers: 2, 4, 8, 6, and then repeat. Similarly, powers of 3 also cycle every 4 numbers: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then repeat. So, both (2^m) and (3^n) have cycles of length 4 for their units digits. That seems important.So, if I can figure out the units digit of (2^m) and (3^n) based on (m) and (n) modulo 4, I can then add them together and check if the units digit is 3. That makes sense.Let me list out the units digits for both:For (2^m):- If (m equiv 1 mod 4), units digit is 2.- If (m equiv 2 mod 4), units digit is 4.- If (m equiv 3 mod 4), units digit is 8.- If (m equiv 0 mod 4), units digit is 6.For (3^n):- If (n equiv 1 mod 4), units digit is 3.- If (n equiv 2 mod 4), units digit is 9.- If (n equiv 3 mod 4), units digit is 7.- If (n equiv 0 mod 4), units digit is 1.Okay, so each units digit for (2^m) and (3^n) depends on (m) and (n) modulo 4. Since (m) and (n) are chosen uniformly from 1 to 100, each residue modulo 4 is equally likely. That means each units digit for (2^m) and (3^n) has a probability of (frac{1}{4}).Now, I need to find all possible pairs of units digits from (2^m) and (3^n) that add up to a number ending with 3. Let's list all possible combinations:1. Units digit of (2^m) is 2:   - Adding 2 to what gives a units digit of 3? It would need to add 1, because 2 + 1 = 3.   - So, units digit of (3^n) needs to be 1.2. Units digit of (2^m) is 4:   - 4 + x = ...3. So, x needs to be 9, because 4 + 9 = 13, which ends with 3.   - So, units digit of (3^n) needs to be 9.3. Units digit of (2^m) is 8:   - 8 + x = ...3. So, x needs to be 5, but wait, 5 isn't in the units digits of (3^n). The units digits of (3^n) are 3, 9, 7, 1. So, 8 + 5 isn't possible here. Therefore, no valid (3^n) units digit for this case.4. Units digit of (2^m) is 6:   - 6 + x = ...3. So, x needs to be 7, because 6 + 7 = 13, which ends with 3.   - So, units digit of (3^n) needs to be 7.Wait, so from the above, the valid pairs are:- (2^m) with units digit 2 and (3^n) with units digit 1.- (2^m) with units digit 4 and (3^n) with units digit 9.- (2^m) with units digit 6 and (3^n) with units digit 7.That's three valid combinations. The case where (2^m) has a units digit of 8 doesn't work because there's no corresponding (3^n) units digit to make the sum end with 3.Now, since each units digit for (2^m) and (3^n) occurs with probability (frac{1}{4}), each of these valid pairs has a probability of (frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{16}).Since there are three such valid pairs, the total probability is (3 times frac{1}{16} = frac{3}{16}).Wait, let me double-check that. So, each of the three combinations is mutually exclusive, right? Because (2^m) can't have two different units digits at the same time, and similarly for (3^n). So, adding their probabilities should give the correct total probability.Yes, that seems right. So, the probability that the units digit of (2^m + 3^n) is 3 is (frac{3}{16}).I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.1. Identified cycles for units digits of (2^m) and (3^n).2. Determined the possible units digits for each based on (m) and (n) modulo 4.3. Found all pairs where the sum of units digits is 3.4. Calculated the probability for each valid pair and summed them up.Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I missed any cases. The key was recognizing the cyclical nature of the units digits and then systematically checking each possible combination.**Final Answer**The probability that the unit digit of (2^{m} + 3^{n}) is 3 is boxed{dfrac{3}{16}}."},{"question":"Let P be a point in the plane containing triangle ABC.

Let me try to understand what it's asking. We have a point P in the plane of triangle ABC, and the equation given is:[overrightarrow{BC} + 2overrightarrow{BA} = 3overrightarrow{BP}]And I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is true based on this equation. The options are all about relationships between vectors PA, PC, and sometimes PB. First, I should recall some vector properties and how to express vectors in terms of position vectors. Maybe I can express all the vectors in terms of PA, PB, and PC. Let me think about how to do that.I know that vectors can be expressed as differences of position vectors. For example, (overrightarrow{BA} = overrightarrow{A} - overrightarrow{B}), and similarly for the others. But since the problem doesn't specify coordinates, maybe I can express everything in terms of vectors from point P.Let me denote (overrightarrow{PA} = vec{a}), (overrightarrow{PB} = vec{b}), and (overrightarrow{PC} = vec{c}). Then, I can express the other vectors in terms of these.So, (overrightarrow{BA}) is the vector from B to A, which is (overrightarrow{A} - overrightarrow{B}). But in terms of PA, PB, etc., I can write:[overrightarrow{BA} = overrightarrow{A} - overrightarrow{B} = (overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{P}) - (overrightarrow{PB} + overrightarrow{P}) = overrightarrow{PA} - overrightarrow{PB} = vec{a} - vec{b}]Similarly, (overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{C} - overrightarrow{B} = (overrightarrow{PC} + overrightarrow{P}) - (overrightarrow{PB} + overrightarrow{P}) = overrightarrow{PC} - overrightarrow{PB} = vec{c} - vec{b})And (overrightarrow{BP}) is just (overrightarrow{P} - overrightarrow{B} = -overrightarrow{PB} = -vec{b})So, substituting these into the given equation:[overrightarrow{BC} + 2overrightarrow{BA} = 3overrightarrow{BP}]becomes:[(vec{c} - vec{b}) + 2(vec{a} - vec{b}) = 3(-vec{b})]Let me simplify the left side:First, expand the terms:[vec{c} - vec{b} + 2vec{a} - 2vec{b}]Combine like terms:[2vec{a} + vec{c} - 3vec{b}]So the equation becomes:[2vec{a} + vec{c} - 3vec{b} = -3vec{b}]Now, let's add (3vec{b}) to both sides:[2vec{a} + vec{c} = 0]Which is:[2overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{PC} = overrightarrow{0}]Looking at the options, that's exactly option A. So, the correct answer should be A.But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the given equation:[overrightarrow{BC} + 2overrightarrow{BA} = 3overrightarrow{BP}]Expressed in terms of PA, PB, PC:[(vec{c} - vec{b}) + 2(vec{a} - vec{b}) = 3(-vec{b})]Expanding:[vec{c} - vec{b} + 2vec{a} - 2vec{b} = -3vec{b}]Combining like terms:[2vec{a} + vec{c} - 3vec{b} = -3vec{b}]Adding (3vec{b}) to both sides:[2vec{a} + vec{c} = 0]Yes, that seems correct. So, 2PA + PC = 0, which is option A.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, it is known that a_2=4 and a_6=6. Find the value of a_{10}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. It says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, a₂ is 4 and a₆ is 6. I need to find the value of a₁₀. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, which is usually denoted as r. So, the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1), where a₁ is the first term.Given that, I can write expressions for a₂ and a₆. Let's see:a₂ = a₁ * r^(2-1) = a₁ * r = 4a₆ = a₁ * r^(6-1) = a₁ * r^5 = 6So, I have two equations:1) a₁ * r = 42) a₁ * r^5 = 6I need to find a₁₀, which would be a₁ * r^(10-1) = a₁ * r^9.But to find a₁₀, I need to know both a₁ and r. So, I should solve these two equations to find a₁ and r.From the first equation, I can express a₁ in terms of r:a₁ = 4 / rNow, substitute this expression for a₁ into the second equation:(4 / r) * r^5 = 6Simplify that:4 * r^(5-1) = 6Which is:4 * r^4 = 6Now, solve for r^4:r^4 = 6 / 4 = 3 / 2So, r^4 = 3/2. Therefore, r is the fourth root of 3/2. But since we're dealing with exponents, I can write r as (3/2)^(1/4). However, I might not need to calculate the exact value of r because when I compute a₁₀, it might simplify.Wait, let me think. If I have r^4 = 3/2, then r^8 would be (r^4)^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4. Similarly, r^9 is r^8 * r = (9/4) * r.But I don't know r yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express a₁₀ in terms of a₆ and a₂ without needing to find a₁ and r separately.Let me recall that in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. So, the ratio between a₆ and a₂ should be r^(6-2) = r^4. From earlier, we found that r^4 = 3/2. So, the ratio from a₂ to a₆ is 3/2.Similarly, the ratio from a₆ to a₁₀ should also be r^4, which is 3/2. Therefore, a₁₀ = a₆ * r^4 = 6 * (3/2) = 9.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is a₁₀ equal to 9? Let me verify that.Alternatively, going back to the expressions:We have a₁ = 4 / rAnd a₆ = a₁ * r^5 = 6Substituting a₁:(4 / r) * r^5 = 6Simplify:4 * r^4 = 6So, r^4 = 6 / 4 = 3 / 2Therefore, r^4 = 3/2Then, a₁₀ = a₁ * r^9But a₁ is 4 / r, so:a₁₀ = (4 / r) * r^9 = 4 * r^8But r^8 is (r^4)^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4Therefore, a₁₀ = 4 * (9/4) = 9Yes, that confirms it. So, a₁₀ is 9.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in a geometric sequence, the terms a₂, a₆, a₁₀ form another geometric sequence because the number of terms between them is the same (4 terms apart). So, the ratio between a₆ and a₂ is the same as the ratio between a₁₀ and a₆.So, if a₂ = 4 and a₆ = 6, then the ratio is 6 / 4 = 3 / 2. Therefore, a₁₀ should be 6 * (3 / 2) = 9.That's another way to see it without having to solve for a₁ and r explicitly.So, whether I approach it by solving for r and then computing a₁₀ or by recognizing that a₂, a₆, a₁₀ form a geometric sequence themselves, I end up with the same answer: 9.I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that a₁₀ is 9.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_{10} ) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"Find the smallest natural number ( N ) such that ( N+2 ) is divisible by 2, ( N+3 ) by 3, ..., ( N+10 ) by 10.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest natural number ( N ) such that when I add 2 to it, the result is divisible by 2; when I add 3, it's divisible by 3; and so on, all the way up to adding 10, which should be divisible by 10. That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, let me write down the conditions:1. ( N + 2 ) is divisible by 2.2. ( N + 3 ) is divisible by 3.3. ( N + 4 ) is divisible by 4.4. ( N + 5 ) is divisible by 5.5. ( N + 6 ) is divisible by 6.6. ( N + 7 ) is divisible by 7.7. ( N + 8 ) is divisible by 8.8. ( N + 9 ) is divisible by 9.9. ( N + 10 ) is divisible by 10.Hmm, okay. So for each ( k ) from 2 to 10, ( N + k ) must be divisible by ( k ). That means ( N equiv -k mod k ) for each ( k ). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think about it again.If ( N + k ) is divisible by ( k ), that means ( N + k equiv 0 mod k ). Which simplifies to ( N equiv -k mod k ). But ( -k mod k ) is the same as ( 0 mod k ), right? Because ( -k ) is just ( k ) less than 0, so modulo ( k ), it's equivalent to 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if ( N equiv 0 mod k ), then ( N ) would have to be a multiple of all these ( k ) values, which would make ( N ) the least common multiple (LCM) of all these numbers. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check.Wait, no, because ( N equiv -k mod k ) is equivalent to ( N equiv 0 mod k ) only if ( k ) divides ( N + k ). But ( N + k equiv 0 mod k ) implies ( N equiv -k mod k ), which is the same as ( N equiv 0 mod k ) because ( -k equiv 0 mod k ). So actually, ( N ) must be congruent to 0 modulo each ( k ) from 2 to 10. That means ( N ) must be a common multiple of all these numbers. Therefore, the smallest such ( N ) would be the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 2 through 10.Okay, so I need to find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Let me recall how to compute the LCM of multiple numbers. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of them. To find it, I can break each number down into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears.Let me list the prime factors of each number from 2 to 10:- 2 is prime: ( 2 )- 3 is prime: ( 3 )- 4 is ( 2^2 )- 5 is prime: ( 5 )- 6 is ( 2 times 3 )- 7 is prime: ( 7 )- 8 is ( 2^3 )- 9 is ( 3^2 )- 10 is ( 2 times 5 )Now, identify the highest powers of each prime:- For 2: the highest power is ( 2^3 ) (from 8)- For 3: the highest power is ( 3^2 ) (from 9)- For 5: the highest power is ( 5 ) (from 5 and 10)- For 7: the highest power is ( 7 ) (from 7)So, the LCM is ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 ).Let me compute that step by step:First, ( 2^3 = 8 ).Next, ( 3^2 = 9 ).Then, multiply 8 and 9: ( 8 times 9 = 72 ).Next, multiply by 5: ( 72 times 5 = 360 ).Finally, multiply by 7: ( 360 times 7 = 2520 ).So, the LCM of the numbers from 2 to 10 is 2520. Therefore, the smallest natural number ( N ) that satisfies all the given conditions is 2520.Wait a second, let me verify this. If ( N = 2520 ), then:- ( 2520 + 2 = 2522 ). Is 2522 divisible by 2? Yes, because it's even.- ( 2520 + 3 = 2523 ). Is 2523 divisible by 3? Let's check: ( 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 12 ), which is divisible by 3, so yes.- ( 2520 + 4 = 2524 ). Divisible by 4? Yes, because the last two digits, 24, are divisible by 4.- ( 2520 + 5 = 2525 ). Divisible by 5? Yes, ends with a 5.- ( 2520 + 6 = 2526 ). Divisible by 6? Yes, because it's even and the sum of digits is ( 2 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 15 ), which is divisible by 3.- ( 2520 + 7 = 2527 ). Divisible by 7? Let's see: ( 2527 ÷ 7 = 361 ), which is exact, so yes.- ( 2520 + 8 = 2528 ). Divisible by 8? Yes, because the last three digits, 528, divided by 8 is 66, so yes.- ( 2520 + 9 = 2529 ). Divisible by 9? Sum of digits: ( 2 + 5 + 2 + 9 = 18 ), which is divisible by 9, so yes.- ( 2520 + 10 = 2530 ). Divisible by 10? Yes, ends with a 0.Okay, so all the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, 2520 is indeed the smallest such number.I think I've got it right. The key was recognizing that each condition ( N + k ) divisible by ( k ) simplifies to ( N ) being a multiple of ( k ), so the smallest ( N ) is the LCM of all these ( k ) values. Calculating the LCM by considering the highest powers of all prime factors involved was the way to go. It makes sense now."},{"question":"Given t = a + 2b, s = a + b^2 + 1, then among the following options regarding the relationship between t and s, the correct one is (　　)A: t > sB: t geq sC: t < sD: t leq s","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given two expressions: t equals a plus 2b, and s equals a plus b squared plus 1. I need to figure out the relationship between t and s. The options are whether t is greater than s, greater than or equal to s, less than s, or less than or equal to s. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, maybe I should write down the expressions again to make sure I have them right. So, t is a + 2b, and s is a + b² + 1. I need to compare t and s. Maybe I can subtract one from the other to see which one is bigger or if there's a consistent relationship.Let me try subtracting t from s. So, s - t would be (a + b² + 1) - (a + 2b). Let me simplify that. The a terms cancel out because a - a is zero. Then I'm left with b² + 1 - 2b. Hmm, that simplifies to b² - 2b + 1. Wait a minute, that looks familiar. Isn't that a perfect square?Yes, b² - 2b + 1 is equal to (b - 1)². So, s - t equals (b - 1) squared. Now, since a square of any real number is always non-negative, (b - 1)² is greater than or equal to zero. That means s - t is greater than or equal to zero, which implies that s is greater than or equal to t.So, s is always at least as big as t, right? Because even if b is 1, which would make (b - 1)² zero, s would still be equal to t. For any other value of b, s would be larger than t. Therefore, the relationship between t and s is that t is less than or equal to s.Looking back at the options, option D is t ≤ s, which matches what I just figured out. So, I think D is the correct answer. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with s - t: (a + b² + 1) - (a + 2b) simplifies to b² - 2b + 1, which is indeed (b - 1)². Since squares are always non-negative, s - t is always ≥ 0, so s ≥ t. Therefore, t ≤ s. Yeah, that seems right.I don't think I made any errors in my calculations. The key was recognizing that the expression simplifies to a perfect square, which makes it easy to determine the sign. So, I feel confident that D is the correct choice here."},{"question":"The volume of a cylinder is 72pi text{cm}^3. The height of the cylinder is twice its radius. Find the volume of a cone that has the same height and radius as the cylinder. Express your answer in terms of pi.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a cylinder and a cone. The volume of the cylinder is given as 72π cm³, and it says that the height of the cylinder is twice its radius. I need to find the volume of a cone that has the same height and radius as the cylinder, and express the answer in terms of π. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the height is twice the radius, I can express h as 2r. So, substituting that into the volume formula, the volume becomes V = πr²(2r). Simplifying that, it's 2πr³. Given that the volume of the cylinder is 72π, I can set up the equation 2πr³ = 72π. Hmm, okay, so if I divide both sides by π, that cancels out π, leaving me with 2r³ = 72. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get r³ = 36. To find r, I need to take the cube root of 36. Wait, is 36 a perfect cube? Let me think. 3³ is 27, and 4³ is 64, so 36 is between those. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, no, let me double-check. The volume formula for the cylinder is correct: V = πr²h, and since h = 2r, substituting gives V = πr²(2r) = 2πr³. Plugging in 72π, we have 2πr³ = 72π. Dividing both sides by π gives 2r³ = 72, and then dividing by 2 gives r³ = 36. So, r is the cube root of 36. But 36 isn't a perfect cube, so maybe I need to express it differently or perhaps I made an error in the calculations.Wait, hold on. Let me recast the problem. Maybe I can solve for r numerically. If r³ = 36, then r = ∛36. Calculating that, ∛36 is approximately 3.3019 cm. But since the problem doesn't specify rounding, maybe I can leave it as ∛36 for now. Then, the height h is twice that, so h = 2r = 2∛36. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way or perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, let me go back. The volume of the cylinder is 72π, and the height is twice the radius. So, V = πr²h = πr²(2r) = 2πr³. So, 2πr³ = 72π. Dividing both sides by π, we get 2r³ = 72. Dividing both sides by 2, r³ = 36. So, r = ∛36. That seems correct. Maybe I just need to proceed with that.Now, moving on to the cone. The volume of a cone is given by V = (1/3)πr²h. Since the cone has the same height and radius as the cylinder, we can use the same r and h values. So, substituting, V = (1/3)π(∛36)²(2∛36). Let's simplify that.First, (∛36)² is (∛36) squared, which is 36^(2/3). Then, multiplying by 2∛36, which is 2*36^(1/3). So, altogether, we have (1/3)π*(36^(2/3))*(2*36^(1/3)). Combining the exponents, 36^(2/3) * 36^(1/3) = 36^(2/3 + 1/3) = 36^1 = 36. So, now we have (1/3)*π*2*36. Simplifying that, (1/3)*2*36 = (2/3)*36 = 24. Therefore, the volume of the cone is 24π cm³.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If r³ = 36, then r = ∛36. Then, h = 2∛36. Plugging into the cone volume formula: (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π*(∛36)²*(2∛36). As I did before, (∛36)² * ∛36 = (∛36)³ = 36. So, (1/3)*π*2*36 = (2/3)*36π = 24π. Yeah, that checks out.Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way without dealing with cube roots. Let's see. If I let r³ = 36, then r² = (r³)^(2/3) = 36^(2/3). But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of r³ = 36.Wait, another approach: Since the volume of the cylinder is 72π, and the volume of the cone is (1/3) of that, because cones have 1/3 the volume of cylinders with the same base and height. So, is that a rule? Yes, I think so. The volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. So, if the cylinder is 72π, then the cone would be (1/3)*72π = 24π. That's a much quicker way.Wait, but does that apply here? Because in this case, the height is twice the radius, but since both the cylinder and the cone have the same height and radius, the ratio should still hold. So, regardless of the specific dimensions, as long as the height and radius are the same, the cone's volume is one-third of the cylinder's volume. So, 72π divided by 3 is 24π. That seems correct.So, maybe I overcomplicated it earlier by trying to solve for r and h explicitly. The key insight is recognizing that the volume of the cone is one-third that of the cylinder when they share the same base and height. Therefore, without needing to calculate the exact radius and height, I can directly find the cone's volume by dividing the cylinder's volume by 3.But just to make sure, let me confirm with the initial method. If r³ = 36, then r = ∛36. Then, h = 2∛36. Plugging into the cone's volume: (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π*(∛36)²*(2∛36) = (1/3)π*2*(∛36)^3 = (1/3)π*2*36 = (2/3)*36π = 24π. Yep, same result.So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. It's good to know that sometimes recognizing the relationship between shapes can simplify the problem, avoiding unnecessary calculations.In summary, the volume of the cone is 24π cm³."},{"question":"2^1 times 1 = 2, 2^2 times 1 times 3 = 3 times 4, 2^3 times 1 times 3 times 5 = 4 times 5 times 6, 2^4 times 1 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 5 times 6 times 7 times 8, and so on.

Let me write them down again to see if I can spot a pattern.First, the given equations are:1. (2^1 times 1 = 2)2. (2^2 times 1 times 3 = 3 times 4)3. (2^3 times 1 times 3 times 5 = 4 times 5 times 6)4. (2^4 times 1 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 5 times 6 times 7 times 8)And it says \\"and so on.\\" So, I need to generalize this pattern for any n.Let me analyze each part step by step.Starting with the left side of the equation:- For n=1: (2^1 times 1)- For n=2: (2^2 times 1 times 3)- For n=3: (2^3 times 1 times 3 times 5)- For n=4: (2^4 times 1 times 3 times 5 times 7)I notice that on the left side, the exponent of 2 is equal to n, and then it's multiplied by the product of the first n odd numbers. So, for the nth equation, the left side is (2^n) multiplied by the product of the first n odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to (2n-1). So, the left side can be written as:(2^n times 1 times 3 times 5 times ldots times (2n - 1))Now, looking at the right side of the equation:- For n=1: 2- For n=2: 3 × 4- For n=3: 4 × 5 × 6- For n=4: 5 × 6 × 7 × 8Here, it seems like the right side is a product of n consecutive integers starting from (n+1). Let's verify:- For n=1: Starting from 2 (which is 1+1), and since n=1, it's just 2.- For n=2: Starting from 3 (which is 2+1), and since n=2, it's 3 × 4.- For n=3: Starting from 4 (which is 3+1), and since n=3, it's 4 × 5 × 6.- For n=4: Starting from 5 (which is 4+1), and since n=4, it's 5 × 6 × 7 × 8.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the right side is the product of n consecutive integers starting from (n+1) up to (2n). So, the right side can be written as:((n+1) times (n+2) times ldots times (2n))Putting it all together, the nth equation should be:(2^n times 1 times 3 times 5 times ldots times (2n - 1) = (n+1) times (n+2) times ldots times (2n))To make sure this is correct, let's test it with n=1, 2, 3, and 4.For n=1:Left side: (2^1 times 1 = 2)Right side: (2)They match.For n=2:Left side: (2^2 times 1 times 3 = 4 times 3 = 12)Right side: (3 times 4 = 12)They match.For n=3:Left side: (2^3 times 1 times 3 times 5 = 8 times 15 = 120)Right side: (4 times 5 times 6 = 120)They match.For n=4:Left side: (2^4 times 1 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 16 times 105 = 1680)Right side: (5 times 6 times 7 times 8 = 1680)They match.Okay, so it seems like this generalization works for the given cases. Therefore, the nth equation is as I wrote above.I think I've got it. The nth equation involves multiplying 2 to the power of n with the product of the first n odd numbers on the left, and on the right, it's the product of n consecutive integers starting from (n+1) up to 2n. This pattern holds for each given example, so it should be the correct generalization.Just to double-check, let's consider n=5.Left side: (2^5 times 1 times 3 times 5 times 7 times 9 = 32 times 945 = 30240)Right side: (6 times 7 times 8 times 9 times 10 = 30240)They match as well.So, yes, the pattern holds. Therefore, the nth equation is:(2^n times 1 times 3 times 5 times ldots times (2n - 1) = (n+1) times (n+2) times ldots times (2n))**Final Answer**The (n)-th equation is boxed{2^n times 1 times 3 times ldots times (2n-1) = (n+1) times ldots times (2n-1) times 2n}."},{"question":"The sum of the two diagonals of a rhombus is l, and its area is S. Then, its side length is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a rhombus. It says that the sum of the two diagonals is ( l ), and the area is ( S ). I need to find the side length of the rhombus. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all four sides are equal in length. That's good because it means once I find one side, I know all sides are the same. Now, the problem mentions the diagonals. I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, they cut each other exactly in half and form four right-angled triangles inside the rhombus.Let me denote the lengths of the diagonals as ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ). The problem states that the sum of these diagonals is ( l ), so I can write that as:[ d_1 + d_2 = l ]The area ( S ) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:[ S = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2 ]So, I have two equations:1. ( d_1 + d_2 = l )2. ( frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 = S )I need to find the side length of the rhombus. Let's denote the side length as ( m ). Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, each side of the rhombus can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the legs are half of each diagonal. So, each half-diagonal is ( frac{d_1}{2} ) and ( frac{d_2}{2} ). Therefore, using the Pythagorean theorem:[ m = sqrt{left( frac{d_1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{d_2}{2} right)^2} ]Simplifying that, we get:[ m = frac{1}{2} sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2} ]Okay, so I need to find ( d_1^2 + d_2^2 ) in terms of ( l ) and ( S ). I already have ( d_1 + d_2 = l ). I also know that:[ (d_1 + d_2)^2 = d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_2 + d_2^2 ]Which means:[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (d_1 + d_2)^2 - 2d_1 d_2 ]Substituting the known values:[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 = l^2 - 2d_1 d_2 ]But from the area formula, ( frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 = S ), so:[ d_1 d_2 = 2S ]Plugging that back into the equation:[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 = l^2 - 2(2S) ][ d_1^2 + d_2^2 = l^2 - 4S ]Now, substitute this back into the expression for ( m ):[ m = frac{1}{2} sqrt{l^2 - 4S} ]So, the side length ( m ) of the rhombus is:[ m = frac{sqrt{l^2 - 4S}}{2} ]Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by denoting the diagonals as ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ), then used the given sum and area to relate them. I applied the Pythagorean theorem correctly to find the side length in terms of the diagonals. Then, I expressed ( d_1^2 + d_2^2 ) in terms of ( l ) and ( S ) by expanding ( (d_1 + d_2)^2 ) and substituting ( d_1 d_2 ) from the area formula. Everything seems to add up. So, I think my final expression for the side length is correct.**Final Answer**The side length of the rhombus is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{l^2 - 4S}}{2}}."},{"question":"For how many integer values of ( x ) is the inequality ( 7x^2 + 23x + 20 > 30 ) not satisfied?","answer":"First, I need to simplify the given inequality (7x^2 + 23x + 20 > 30). I'll subtract 30 from both sides to get (7x^2 + 23x - 10 > 0).Next, I'll factor the quadratic expression (7x^2 + 23x - 10). Looking for two numbers that multiply to (-70) (the product of 7 and (-10)) and add up to 23, I find that 35 and (-2) work. This allows me to factor the quadratic as ((7x - 2)(x + 5)).Now, I need to determine when the inequality ((7x - 2)(x + 5) > 0) is not satisfied, which means finding when ((7x - 2)(x + 5) leq 0).To solve this, I'll analyze the critical points where each factor equals zero: (7x - 2 = 0) gives (x = frac{2}{7}), and (x + 5 = 0) gives (x = -5).These critical points divide the number line into intervals. I'll test each interval to determine the sign of the product ((7x - 2)(x + 5)):1. **Interval 1:** (x < -5)   - Both (7x - 2) and (x + 5) are negative.   - The product is positive.2. **Interval 2:** (-5 < x < frac{2}{7})   - (7x - 2) is negative and (x + 5) is positive.   - The product is negative.3. **Interval 3:** (x > frac{2}{7})   - Both (7x - 2) and (x + 5) are positive.   - The product is positive.The inequality ((7x - 2)(x + 5) leq 0) is satisfied in the interval where the product is negative or zero, which is (-5 leq x leq frac{2}{7}).Finally, I'll identify the integer values of (x) within this interval:- (-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0)There are 6 integer values where the inequality is not satisfied."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate plane, point O is the origin, and the distance between moving point P(x,y) and fixed point F(-1,0), and its distance to the fixed line x=-2 have a ratio of frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.(1) Find the equation of the trajectory C of moving point P;(2) A chord AB is drawn through F, not perpendicular to the y-axis on curve C. M is the midpoint of AB, and the line OM intersects with curve C at points P and Q. Find the minimum area of quadrilateral APBQ.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a moving point P in the Cartesian plane. It says that the ratio of the distance from P to a fixed point F(-1, 0) and the distance from P to the fixed line x = -2 is sqrt(2)/2. I need to find the equation of the trajectory C of point P. Then, there's a second part about a chord AB through F, and some stuff about midpoints and areas. But let's take it step by step.Starting with part (1). I remember that when the ratio of distances from a point to a fixed point and a fixed line is constant, it's called a conic section. The ratio is called the eccentricity. If the eccentricity is less than 1, it's an ellipse; if it's equal to 1, it's a parabola; and if it's greater than 1, it's a hyperbola. Here, the ratio is sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 0.707, so less than 1. That means the trajectory should be an ellipse.So, let's denote the moving point as P(x, y). The distance from P to F(-1, 0) is sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2]. The distance from P to the line x = -2 is |x + 2|. The ratio of these distances is sqrt(2)/2. So, mathematically, this can be written as:sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2] / |x + 2| = sqrt(2)/2To get rid of the square roots and the fraction, I can square both sides:[(x + 1)^2 + y^2] / (x + 2)^2 = (2)/4 = 1/2So, multiplying both sides by (x + 2)^2:(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = (1/2)(x + 2)^2Let me expand both sides:Left side: (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2Right side: (1/2)(x^2 + 4x + 4) = (1/2)x^2 + 2x + 2So, putting it all together:x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 = (1/2)x^2 + 2x + 2Subtract (1/2)x^2 + 2x + 2 from both sides:x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 - (1/2)x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0Simplify:(1 - 1/2)x^2 + (2x - 2x) + (1 - 2) + y^2 = 0Which simplifies to:(1/2)x^2 - 1 + y^2 = 0Bring the constant term to the other side:(1/2)x^2 + y^2 = 1To make it look neater, multiply both sides by 2:x^2 + 2y^2 = 2So, the equation is x^2/2 + y^2 = 1. That's an ellipse with semi-major axis sqrt(2) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 1 along the y-axis. Okay, that seems right.Moving on to part (2). It says a chord AB is drawn through F, not perpendicular to the y-axis on curve C. So, AB is a chord passing through F(-1, 0), and it's not vertical, meaning it's not perpendicular to the y-axis. So, AB has some slope, not infinite.M is the midpoint of AB. Then, the line OM intersects curve C at points P and Q. We need to find the minimum area of quadrilateral APBQ.First, I need to visualize this. We have an ellipse C: x^2/2 + y^2 = 1. Point F is (-1, 0), which is actually one of the foci of the ellipse because for an ellipse x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1, the foci are at (±c, 0) where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Here, a^2 = 2, b^2 = 1, so c^2 = 1, so c = 1. So, foci at (-1, 0) and (1, 0). So, F is a focus.So, chord AB passes through F(-1, 0). Let me denote points A and B on the ellipse such that the chord AB passes through F. Then, M is the midpoint of AB. Then, the line from the origin O to M intersects the ellipse again at P and Q. So, quadrilateral APBQ is formed by points A, P, B, Q.We need to find the minimum area of this quadrilateral.First, let me think about how to parametrize chord AB. Since it passes through F(-1, 0), and it's not vertical, it must have some slope m. So, the equation of AB can be written as y = m(x + 1). Alternatively, since it's a chord through F, maybe parametric equations can be used.But perhaps it's better to use a parameter for the line. Let me denote the line AB as passing through F(-1, 0) with slope m, so its equation is y = m(x + 1).Now, to find points A and B where this line intersects the ellipse x^2/2 + y^2 = 1.Substitute y = m(x + 1) into the ellipse equation:x^2/2 + [m(x + 1)]^2 = 1Expand this:x^2/2 + m^2(x^2 + 2x + 1) = 1Multiply through:x^2/2 + m^2x^2 + 2m^2x + m^2 = 1Combine like terms:(1/2 + m^2)x^2 + 2m^2x + (m^2 - 1) = 0Multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:(1 + 2m^2)x^2 + 4m^2x + 2(m^2 - 1) = 0So, quadratic in x:(1 + 2m^2)x^2 + 4m^2x + 2m^2 - 2 = 0Let me denote this as:Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0, whereA = 1 + 2m^2B = 4m^2C = 2m^2 - 2Now, the solutions to this quadratic will give me the x-coordinates of points A and B.Let me compute the discriminant D:D = B^2 - 4AC = (4m^2)^2 - 4*(1 + 2m^2)*(2m^2 - 2)Compute each part:(4m^2)^2 = 16m^44*(1 + 2m^2)*(2m^2 - 2) = 4*[ (1)(2m^2 - 2) + 2m^2*(2m^2 - 2) ] = 4*[2m^2 - 2 + 4m^4 - 4m^2] = 4*[4m^4 - 2m^2 - 2] = 16m^4 - 8m^2 - 8So, D = 16m^4 - (16m^4 - 8m^2 - 8) = 16m^4 -16m^4 +8m^2 +8 = 8m^2 +8 = 8(m^2 +1)So, discriminant is positive, which makes sense as the line intersects the ellipse at two points.Now, the solutions are:x = [-B ± sqrt(D)]/(2A) = [-4m^2 ± sqrt(8(m^2 +1))]/[2*(1 + 2m^2)]Simplify sqrt(8(m^2 +1)) = 2*sqrt(2(m^2 +1))So,x = [-4m^2 ± 2sqrt(2(m^2 +1))]/[2*(1 + 2m^2)] = [-2m^2 ± sqrt(2(m^2 +1))]/(1 + 2m^2)Therefore, the x-coordinates of A and B are:x1 = [-2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1))]/(1 + 2m^2)x2 = [-2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1))]/(1 + 2m^2)Corresponding y-coordinates are y1 = m(x1 +1) and y2 = m(x2 +1)So, points A and B are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).Now, midpoint M of AB is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)Compute x1 + x2:x1 + x2 = [(-2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1))) + (-2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)))]/(1 + 2m^2) = (-4m^2)/(1 + 2m^2)Similarly, y1 + y2 = m(x1 +1) + m(x2 +1) = m(x1 + x2 + 2) = m[ (-4m^2)/(1 + 2m^2) + 2 ] = m[ (-4m^2 + 2(1 + 2m^2) )/(1 + 2m^2) ] = m[ (-4m^2 + 2 + 4m^2 )/(1 + 2m^2) ] = m[2/(1 + 2m^2)] = 2m/(1 + 2m^2)Therefore, midpoint M has coordinates:M_x = (x1 + x2)/2 = (-4m^2)/(2*(1 + 2m^2)) = (-2m^2)/(1 + 2m^2)M_y = (y1 + y2)/2 = (2m/(1 + 2m^2))/2 = m/(1 + 2m^2)So, M is at (-2m^2/(1 + 2m^2), m/(1 + 2m^2))Now, line OM connects the origin O(0,0) to M(-2m^2/(1 + 2m^2), m/(1 + 2m^2)). Let's find the equation of line OM.The slope of OM is (M_y - 0)/(M_x - 0) = [m/(1 + 2m^2)] / [ -2m^2/(1 + 2m^2) ] = -m/(2m^2) = -1/(2m)So, the equation of line OM is y = (-1/(2m))xWe need to find where this line intersects the ellipse C again at points P and Q.So, substitute y = (-1/(2m))x into the ellipse equation x^2/2 + y^2 = 1:x^2/2 + [ (-1/(2m))x ]^2 = 1Simplify:x^2/2 + (1/(4m^2))x^2 = 1Factor x^2:x^2 [1/2 + 1/(4m^2)] = 1Combine terms:x^2 [ (2m^2 + 1)/(4m^2) ) ] = 1So,x^2 = 1 * (4m^2)/(2m^2 + 1) = 4m^2/(2m^2 + 1)Therefore, x = ± 2m / sqrt(2m^2 + 1)Corresponding y = (-1/(2m))x = (-1/(2m))*(±2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1)) = ∓1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1)So, points P and Q are:P( 2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1) )Q( -2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1) )Wait, actually, since line OM passes through the origin and M, which is in a specific direction, depending on m, but the intersection points P and Q are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, perhaps P is in one direction and Q is in the opposite.But regardless, we have the coordinates of P and Q.Now, quadrilateral APBQ is formed by points A, P, B, Q. To find its area, perhaps we can use the shoelace formula or vector cross products.But before that, maybe there's a smarter way. Since APBQ is a quadrilateral, and points A and B are on the ellipse, and P and Q are also on the ellipse, maybe the area can be expressed in terms of the distances or something else.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the area as the sum of triangles or something.Wait, another approach: since line OM intersects the ellipse at P and Q, and M is the midpoint of AB, maybe there's some symmetry or relation between these points.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize everything in terms of m and then express the area as a function of m, then find its minimum.Given that, let's try to compute the area of quadrilateral APBQ.First, let's note that quadrilateral APBQ can be thought of as two triangles: APB and AQB? Wait, no, that might not cover the whole quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe it's a convex quadrilateral, so we can use the shoelace formula.But to use shoelace, we need coordinates of all four points: A, P, B, Q.We have coordinates for A, B, P, Q in terms of m. So, perhaps we can write the area as a function of m and then minimize it.But this might get complicated, but let's try.First, let's write down coordinates:Point A: (x1, y1) = [ (-2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2), m(x1 +1) ]Similarly, point B: (x2, y2) = [ (-2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2), m(x2 +1) ]Points P and Q: (2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1)) and (-2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.Wait, perhaps instead of parametrizing the line AB with slope m, we can use a parameter t for the points on the ellipse.Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the ellipse.The ellipse x^2/2 + y^2 =1 can be parametrized as:x = sqrt(2) cosθy = sinθSo, any point on the ellipse can be written as (sqrt(2) cosθ, sinθ)So, suppose point A is (sqrt(2) cosθ, sinθ), then point B, being the other intersection of chord AB through F(-1, 0), can be found using the chord properties.But since AB is a chord through F, perhaps we can relate θ for point A and point B.Alternatively, maybe using the parametric form, we can find the midpoint M.Wait, perhaps this approach is better.Let me denote point A as (sqrt(2) cosθ, sinθ). Then, since AB is a chord through F(-1, 0), point B can be found such that F is the midpoint of AB? Wait, no, F is just a point on AB, not necessarily the midpoint.Wait, but in our earlier approach, we had M as the midpoint of AB, which is different from F.So, perhaps using parametric equations complicates things.Alternatively, let's think about the line AB: it passes through F(-1, 0) and has slope m.We already found points A and B in terms of m, so maybe we can proceed with that.Alternatively, perhaps we can express the area in terms of vectors or determinants.Wait, another idea: the area of quadrilateral APBQ can be found as twice the area of triangle APB, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, since APBQ is a quadrilateral, perhaps it's a parallelogram? If so, then the area would be the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AP and AQ.But I don't think APBQ is necessarily a parallelogram.Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the area can be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles APB and AQB.But I need to think carefully.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates, we can compute the area via the shoelace formula.Given four points: A, P, B, Q.But to apply shoelace, we need the coordinates in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise.But without knowing the exact positions, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps we can proceed.Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach.Wait, another idea: since points A and B are on the ellipse, and points P and Q are also on the ellipse, and line OM connects the origin to the midpoint M of AB, which intersects the ellipse again at P and Q.So, perhaps quadrilateral APBQ is symmetric with respect to line OM.Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of power of a point or something related.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates, express the area in terms of m, and then find its minimum.Given that, let's try to compute the area.First, let's note that quadrilateral APBQ can be split into two triangles: APB and AQB. But actually, APBQ is a quadrilateral, so maybe it's better to split it into triangles APB and BPQ or something else.Alternatively, perhaps use the shoelace formula.But to do that, I need coordinates of all four points in order.Given that, let's denote:Point A: (x1, y1)Point P: (2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))Point B: (x2, y2)Point Q: (-2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))But to apply shoelace, we need the points in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise.Assuming the order A, P, B, Q, let's write their coordinates:A: (x1, y1)P: (2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))B: (x2, y2)Q: (-2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))But this might not be the correct order. Alternatively, maybe A, B, Q, P or something else.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider vectors.Wait, another approach: the area of quadrilateral APBQ can be found as the sum of the areas of triangles APB and AQB.But actually, APBQ is a quadrilateral, so maybe it's the sum of triangles APB and AQB, but I need to ensure they don't overlap.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the area of a quadrilateral given four points.Alternatively, perhaps using determinants.Wait, another idea: since points A and B are on line AB, and points P and Q are on line PQ (which is OM), perhaps the area can be expressed in terms of the distances from A and B to line PQ.Wait, yes, that might work.Because if we consider line PQ, then points A and B are on one side, and points P and Q are on the line. So, the area of quadrilateral APBQ can be thought of as the sum of the areas of triangles APQ and BPQ, but actually, since APBQ is a quadrilateral, perhaps it's the area between lines AB and PQ.Wait, actually, if we think of APBQ as a quadrilateral, it's formed by two triangles: APB and AQB, but I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that quadrilateral APBQ is a kite or something, but I don't think so.Wait, perhaps the area can be expressed as |(A - P) × (B - P)| / 2 + |(B - Q) × (A - Q)| / 2, but this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps using the shoelace formula is the way to go.But given the complexity of the coordinates, maybe it's better to find a parametric expression for the area in terms of m and then find its minimum.Alternatively, perhaps we can find the area in terms of the distance between lines AB and PQ, but I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: since points A and B are on line AB, and points P and Q are on line PQ (which is OM), the area of quadrilateral APBQ can be expressed as the product of the length of AB and the distance between lines AB and PQ, divided by 2 or something.Wait, actually, no. The area of a quadrilateral formed by two intersecting lines is not straightforward.Wait, perhaps using the formula for the area of a quadrilateral as the sum of the areas of two triangles: APB and AQB.But to compute that, we need the coordinates.Alternatively, perhaps we can find the area using vectors.Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OP, OQ.But since we're dealing with quadrilateral APBQ, perhaps the area can be expressed as the magnitude of (AP × AQ) or something.Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to use coordinates.Given that, let's try to compute the area using the shoelace formula.First, let's list the coordinates of A, P, B, Q in order.But to do that, I need to know the exact coordinates.Given that, let's recall:Point A: (x1, y1) = [ (-2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2), m(x1 +1) ]Similarly, Point B: (x2, y2) = [ (-2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2), m(x2 +1) ]Points P and Q: (2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1)) and (-2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))But this is quite messy. Maybe instead of expressing everything in terms of m, we can find a relationship or simplify.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the area can be expressed in terms of the lengths of AB and PQ and the sine of the angle between them.Wait, another idea: since APBQ is a quadrilateral, its area can be found as the sum of the areas of triangles APB and AQB.But to compute that, we need the coordinates.Alternatively, perhaps we can use determinants for the area.Wait, let's recall that the area of a quadrilateral with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4) can be computed as:1/2 | (x1y2 - y1x2) + (x2y3 - y2x3) + (x3y4 - y3x4) + (x4y1 - y4x1) |So, let's apply this formula.First, let's denote the points in order: A, P, B, Q.So,A: (x1, y1)P: (2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))B: (x2, y2)Q: (-2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1), 1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1))So, applying the shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 | x1y2 - y1x2 + x2y3 - y2x3 + x3y4 - y3x4 + x4y1 - y4x1 |But in our case, the points are A, P, B, Q, so:Compute:Term1: x1 * y_P - y1 * x_PTerm2: x_P * y_B - y_P * x_BTerm3: x_B * y_Q - y_B * x_QTerm4: x_Q * y_A - y_Q * x_AThen, sum these terms and take absolute value, then multiply by 1/2.So, let's compute each term.First, Term1: x1 * y_P - y1 * x_Px1 = [ -2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ] / (1 + 2m^2)y_P = -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1)y1 = m(x1 +1) = m[ ( -2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) + 1 ] = m[ ( -2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) + 1 + 2m^2 ) / (1 + 2m^2) ] = m[ ( sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) +1 ) / (1 + 2m^2) ]x_P = 2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1)So,Term1 = x1 * y_P - y1 * x_P= [ (-2m^2 + sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) ] * [ -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1) ] - [ m( sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) +1 ) / (1 + 2m^2) ] * [ 2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1) ]Simplify:= [ (2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / ( (1 + 2m^2) sqrt(2m^2 +1) ) ] -

y_P * x_Bx_P = 2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1)y_B = m(x2 +1) = m[ ( -2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) +1 ] = m[ ( -2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) +1 + 2m^2 ) / (1 + 2m^2) ] = m[ (1 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) ]x_B = [ -2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ] / (1 + 2m^2 )y_P = -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1)So,Term2 = x_P * y_B - y_P * x_B= [ 2m / sqrt(2m^2 +1) ] * [ m(1 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) ] - [ -1 / sqrt(2m^2 +1) ] * [ (-2m^2 - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) ) / (1 + 2m^2) ]Simplify:= [ 2m^2 (1 -

sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) / sqrt(2m^2 +1 )Therefore, the total area is:1/2 | Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 | = 1/2 | 4 * [ - sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) / sqrt(2m^2 +1 ) ] | = 1/2 * 4 * sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) / sqrt(2m^2 +1 ) = 2 * sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) / sqrt(2m^2 +1 )Simplify:sqrt(2(m^2 +1)) / sqrt(2m^2 +1 ) = sqrt(2(m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1)) = sqrt(2*(m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1))So, area S = 2 * sqrt(2*(m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1)) = 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt( (m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1) )Simplify further:S = 2√2 * sqrt( (m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1) )We need to find the minimum of S with respect to m.So, let's denote f(m) = sqrt( (m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1) )We need to minimize S = 2√2 * f(m)So, minimizing f(m) will minimize S.Let’s compute f(m)^2 = (m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1)Let’s set t = m^2, t ≥ 0Then, f(m)^2 = (t +1)/(2t +1)We need to find the minimum of (t +1)/(2t +1) for t ≥0Compute derivative:Let’s denote g(t) = (t +1)/(2t +1)g’(t) = [ (1)(2t +1) - (t +1)(2) ] / (2t +1)^2 = [2t +1 - 2t -2 ] / (2t +1)^2 = (-1)/(2t +1)^2 < 0So, g(t) is decreasing for t ≥0Therefore, its minimum occurs as t approaches infinity.As t → ∞, g(t) = (t +1)/(2t +1) ≈ t/(2t) = 1/2But wait, since g(t) is decreasing, its minimum is 1/2, achieved as t→∞.But wait, actually, as t increases, g(t) approaches 1/2 from above.But since g(t) is decreasing, its minimum value is 1/2, but it's never actually reached; it's the infimum.But wait, actually, when t =0, g(0) = (0 +1)/(0 +1) =1As t increases, g(t) decreases towards 1/2.Therefore, the minimum value of g(t) is 1/2, achieved in the limit as t→∞.But since t = m^2, as m→∞, t→∞.But we need to find the minimum of S, which is 2√2 * sqrt(g(t)).Since g(t) approaches 1/2, sqrt(g(t)) approaches sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2Therefore, S approaches 2√2 * 1/√2 = 2So, the minimum area is 2.But wait, is this achievable? Since as m→∞, the chord AB becomes almost horizontal, but in reality, m can be any real number except where the line is vertical, which is already excluded.But in the limit, as m→∞, the area approaches 2.But we need to check if this is indeed the minimum.Alternatively, perhaps the minimum occurs at a finite m.Wait, let's compute the derivative of f(m)^2 = (m^2 +1)/(2m^2 +1)We can set t = m^2, then f(m)^2 = (t +1)/(2t +1)As we saw, g(t) is decreasing, so its minimum is 1/2, but it's approached as t→∞.Therefore, the minimum of S is 2√2 * sqrt(1/2) = 2√2 * (√2/2) = 2So, the minimum area is 2.Therefore, the minimum area of quadrilateral APBQ is 2.**Final Answer**The minimum area of quadrilateral (APBQ) is (boxed{2})."},{"question":"The Razorback shop makes  115 dollars off each jersey and  25 off each t-shirt.

How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?\\"Alright, so the shop makes 115 profit per jersey and 25 profit per t-shirt. They sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys during the game. The question is asking how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.Wait a minute, I think I need to clarify something here. The problem mentions the profit made per jersey and per t-shirt, but it's asking about the cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt. So, do they mean the selling price difference or the profit difference? Because profit is different from cost.Let me think. If the shop makes 115 off each jersey, that could mean the profit they make per jersey is 115. Similarly, they make 25 profit per t-shirt. So, if I'm being asked how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, I need to find the difference in their selling prices, not the profit.But wait, the problem doesn't provide the selling prices directly. It only gives the profit per item. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume that the profit is the same as the selling price? That doesn't seem right because profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price.So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the 115 and 25 are the selling prices, not the profits. That would make more sense if the question is about how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.Let me try that approach. If the selling price of a jersey is 115 and the selling price of a t-shirt is 25, then the difference in cost would be 115 minus 25, which is 90. So, a jersey costs 90 more than a t-shirt.But I'm still a bit unsure because the problem mentions \\"makes 115 off each jersey\\" and \\"makes 25 off each t-shirt.\\" That phrasing sounds like profit rather than selling price. If it's profit, then I don't have enough information to find the cost difference because I don't know the cost price of each item.Wait, maybe the problem is trying to say that the shop makes 115 profit per jersey and 25 profit per t-shirt, and they want to know the difference in profit, not the cost. But the question specifically asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, not how much more profit they make.This is a bit confusing. I think I need to make an assumption here. Since the question is about cost difference, and the problem provides profit per item, I might need to assume that the profit is the same as the selling price. Otherwise, I don't have enough information to calculate the cost difference.So, assuming that the 115 and 25 are the selling prices, the difference would be 115 minus 25, which is 90. Therefore, a jersey costs 90 more than a t-shirt.Alternatively, if the 115 and 25 are profits, and I need to find the cost difference, I would need additional information, such as the cost price of each item or the selling price. Since that information isn't provided, I think the intended interpretation is that these are selling prices.Therefore, the answer is that a jersey costs 90 more than a t-shirt."},{"question":"Given vectors vec{a} and vec{b} are not collinear, and real numbers x, y satisfy (3x-4y)vec{a}+(2x-3y)vec{b}=6vec{a}+3vec{b}, then the value of x-y is (    )A: 3B: -3C: 0D: 2","answer":"Alright, so I've got this vector problem here. It says that vectors a and b are not collinear, which means they aren't just scalar multiples of each other. That's good because it tells me that they can form a basis for the plane, right? So, any vector in the plane can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of a and b. The problem gives me an equation involving these vectors: (3x - 4y)a + (2x - 3y)b = 6a + 3b. And I need to find the value of x - y. The options are A: 3, B: -3, C: 0, D: 2.Okay, so since a and b are not collinear, they form a basis, which means the coefficients of a and b on both sides of the equation must be equal. That’s the key here. So, I can set up two equations by equating the coefficients of a and b separately.Let me write that down:For the vector a component:3x - 4y = 6For the vector b component:2x - 3y = 3Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y. I need to solve this system to find x and y, and then compute x - y.Let me write the system again:1) 3x - 4y = 62) 2x - 3y = 3Hmm, how do I solve this? I can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let me try to eliminate one of the variables.Looking at the coefficients, if I can make the coefficients of y the same in both equations, I can subtract them to eliminate y. Let's see.Multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal:1) 3*(3x - 4y) = 3*6 => 9x - 12y = 182) 4*(2x - 3y) = 4*3 => 8x - 12y = 12Now, I have:9x - 12y = 188x - 12y = 12If I subtract the second equation from the first, I can eliminate y:(9x - 12y) - (8x - 12y) = 18 - 129x - 12y - 8x + 12y = 6(9x - 8x) + (-12y + 12y) = 6x = 6Okay, so x is 6. Now, plug this back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use equation 2 because the numbers are smaller.Equation 2: 2x - 3y = 3Plug x = 6:2*6 - 3y = 312 - 3y = 3Subtract 12 from both sides:-3y = 3 - 12-3y = -9Divide both sides by -3:y = (-9)/(-3) = 3So, y is 3.Now, the question asks for x - y. So, x is 6, y is 3.x - y = 6 - 3 = 3So, the value of x - y is 3. Looking at the options, that's option A.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the equations:3x - 4y = 62x - 3y = 3I multiplied the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 to get:9x - 12y = 188x - 12y = 12Subtracting the second from the first:x = 6Then, plugging back into equation 2:2*6 - 3y = 312 - 3y = 3-3y = -9y = 3Yes, that seems correct. So, x - y is indeed 3. So, the answer should be A: 3.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my steps. The key was recognizing that since a and b are not collinear, their coefficients must be equal on both sides of the equation. Then, solving the system of equations gave me x and y, and subtracting them gave the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"In triangle ABC, angle A is trisected by lines AF and AG meeting BC at points F and G respectively. Determine the ratio frac{BF}{GC}.A) frac{AB cdot AF}{AG cdot AC}B) frac{AC cdot AF}{AB cdot AG}C) frac{AG cdot AC}{AB cdot AF}D) frac{AC}{AB}E) frac{AF}{AG}","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC where angle A is being trisected by two lines, AF and AG, which meet BC at points F and G respectively. I need to find the ratio BF/GC. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me visualize the triangle. Triangle ABC with angle A at the top, and sides AB and AC coming down to points B and C. AF and AG are trisecting angle A, so they divide angle A into three equal parts. That means each of the angles BAF, FAG, and GAC is equal. Let's denote each of these angles as θ, so angle BAF = θ, angle FAG = θ, and angle GAC = θ. Therefore, angle BAC is 3θ.Now, AF and AG are trisectors, so they meet BC at F and G. So, points F and G are somewhere along BC. I need to find BF divided by GC. Hmm, okay.I remember that when a triangle has an angle trisected, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem or perhaps some trigonometric identities. Since AF and AG are trisectors, they might not be bisectors, but they divide the angle into three equal parts. So, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or something similar.Let me think about the Angle Bisector Theorem. It states that if a bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But here, AF and AG are not bisectors, they are trisectors. So, maybe I need to apply the theorem multiple times or use a different approach.Alternatively, I can use the Law of Sines on the smaller triangles created by the trisectors. Let's consider triangle ABF and triangle AGC.Wait, maybe I should consider triangles ABF, AFG, and AGC. Since AF and AG trisect angle A, each of the angles at A is θ. So, in triangle ABF, angle at A is θ, in triangle AFG, angle at A is θ, and in triangle AGC, angle at A is θ.Hmm, perhaps I can apply the Law of Sines in triangles ABF and AGC. Let me try that.In triangle ABF, applying the Law of Sines:AB / sin(angle AFB) = AF / sin(angle ABF)Similarly, in triangle AGC:AC / sin(angle AGC) = AG / sin(angle ACG)But I'm not sure if this directly helps me find BF/GC. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of mass point geometry or coordinate geometry. But that might be complicated.Alternatively, I recall that when an angle is trisected, the ratio of the segments on the opposite side can be related through the ratio of the sides adjacent to the angle. Maybe I can use the formula for the ratio when an angle is trisected.I think the formula is something like BF / GC = (AB * AF) / (AG * AC). Let me check if that makes sense.If I consider the trisection, each trisection creates a ratio based on the sides. So, for each trisection, the ratio of the segments is proportional to the product of the adjacent sides and the lengths of the trisectors.Wait, maybe I can derive it step by step.Let me consider the first trisection by AF. So, AF divides angle A into θ and 2θ. Then, applying the Angle Bisector Theorem for angle BAF, which is θ, but AF is not a bisector, it's a trisector. Hmm, maybe I need to use the formula for the ratio when an angle is divided into a certain ratio.I remember that if a line divides an angle into a ratio m:n, then the ratio of the segments on the opposite side is proportional to the ratio of the adjacent sides multiplied by the ratio of the sines of the divided angles.So, in this case, AF divides angle A into θ and 2θ, so the ratio of BF to FG would be proportional to AB / AC * sin(θ) / sin(2θ). Similarly, AG divides angle A into 2θ and θ, so the ratio of FG to GC would be proportional to AF / AG * sin(2θ) / sin(θ).Wait, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can write it out.Let me denote:For AF trisecting angle A into θ and 2θ, the ratio BF / FG = (AB / AC) * (sin θ / sin 2θ)Similarly, for AG trisecting angle A into 2θ and θ, the ratio FG / GC = (AF / AG) * (sin 2θ / sin θ)Now, if I multiply these two ratios together, I get:(BF / FG) * (FG / GC) = (AB / AC) * (sin θ / sin 2θ) * (AF / AG) * (sin 2θ / sin θ)Simplifying, the FG cancels out, and sin θ / sin 2θ * sin 2θ / sin θ cancels out, leaving:BF / GC = (AB / AC) * (AF / AG)So, BF / GC = (AB * AF) / (AG * AC)Looking back at the answer choices, that's option A.Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I considered AF trisecting angle A into θ and 2θ, so the ratio BF / FG is proportional to AB / AC * sin θ / sin 2θ.2. Then, AG trisects angle A into 2θ and θ, so the ratio FG / GC is proportional to AF / AG * sin 2θ / sin θ.3. Multiplying these gives BF / GC = (AB / AC) * (AF / AG) * (sin θ / sin 2θ) * (sin 2θ / sin θ) = (AB * AF) / (AG * AC).Yes, that seems correct. So, the ratio BF / GC is equal to (AB * AF) / (AG * AC), which is option A.I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"Every year, Atlantic salmon swim upstream to return to their birthplace to lay eggs. Scientists studying salmon have found that the swimming speed v (unit: m/s) of salmon can be expressed as v=frac{1}{2}{log}_{3}frac{O}{100}, where O represents the unit of oxygen consumption of the fish. If a salmon wants to increase its swimming speed by 2m/s, the ratio of its oxygen consumption unit to the original oxygen consumption unit is ( )A: 3B: 9C: 27D: 81","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Atlantic salmon and their swimming speed. It says that the speed v in meters per second can be expressed as v equals one half of the logarithm base 3 of O over 100, where O is the unit of oxygen consumption. The question is asking, if a salmon wants to increase its swimming speed by 2 m/s, what's the ratio of its new oxygen consumption unit to the original one? The options are 3, 9, 27, or 81.Alright, let's break this down. I need to find how much the oxygen consumption O needs to increase so that the speed v increases by 2 m/s. The formula given is v = (1/2) * log base 3 of (O/100). So, if I let the original speed be v, then the new speed will be v + 2. I need to find the ratio of the new O to the original O.Let me denote the original oxygen consumption as O1 and the new one as O2. So, according to the formula:v = (1/2) * log3(O1 / 100)And the new speed:v + 2 = (1/2) * log3(O2 / 100)I need to find O2 / O1. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to find the difference:(v + 2) - v = (1/2) * log3(O2 / 100) - (1/2) * log3(O1 / 100)Simplifying the left side:2 = (1/2) * [log3(O2 / 100) - log3(O1 / 100)]I can factor out the 1/2:2 = (1/2) * log3[(O2 / 100) / (O1 / 100)]Because log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). So, simplifying inside the log:(O2 / 100) divided by (O1 / 100) is equal to O2 / O1. So now we have:2 = (1/2) * log3(O2 / O1)To get rid of the 1/2, I can multiply both sides by 2:4 = log3(O2 / O1)Now, to solve for O2 / O1, I need to rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log base 3 of x equals y means that 3^y = x. So here, log3(O2 / O1) = 4 implies that:3^4 = O2 / O1Calculating 3^4: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81. So, 3^4 is 81.Therefore, the ratio O2 / O1 is 81. So, the answer should be D: 81.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the two equations:v = (1/2) log3(O1 / 100)v + 2 = (1/2) log3(O2 / 100)Subtracting them gives 2 = (1/2)(log3(O2 / 100) - log3(O1 / 100))Which simplifies to 2 = (1/2) log3(O2 / O1)Multiplying both sides by 2: 4 = log3(O2 / O1)Exponentiating both sides with base 3: O2 / O1 = 3^4 = 81.Yes, that seems correct. So, the ratio is 81, which is option D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"An integer greater than 99 and less than 1000 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are all different?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: An integer greater than 99 and less than 1000 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are all different? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand the range of numbers we're dealing with. It says greater than 99 and less than 1000. So, that means we're looking at all the three-digit numbers from 100 up to 999. I think that makes sense because 99 is a two-digit number, and 1000 is a four-digit number, so we're focusing on three-digit numbers.Now, to find the probability, I remember that probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find two things: the total number of three-digit numbers, and the number of those that have all different digits.Let's start with the total number of three-digit numbers. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. To find how many numbers are there in total, I can subtract the smallest from the largest and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, 999 minus 100 is 899, and adding one gives us 900. So, there are 900 three-digit numbers in total.Next, I need to find how many of these 900 numbers have all different digits. This seems a bit trickier. Let's break it down digit by digit. A three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a ones place. Each of these places can have digits from 0 to 9, but with some restrictions.First, the hundreds place can't be zero because then it wouldn't be a three-digit number. So, the hundreds digit can be from 1 to 9. That's 9 possible choices.Now, for the tens place, it can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it has to be different from the hundreds digit. So, if the hundreds digit was, say, 1, then the tens digit can be any digit except 1, giving us 9 choices again.Similarly, for the ones place, it has to be different from both the hundreds and the tens digits. So, if the hundreds digit was 1 and the tens digit was 2, then the ones digit can be any digit except 1 or 2, leaving us with 8 choices.So, putting that all together, the number of three-digit numbers with all different digits is 9 (for the hundreds place) multiplied by 9 (for the tens place) multiplied by 8 (for the ones place). Let me calculate that: 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 8 is 648. So, there are 648 three-digit numbers with all different digits.Now, to find the probability, I take the number of favorable outcomes (which is 648) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (which is 900). So, 648 divided by 900. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 108. Dividing numerator and denominator by 108 gives me 6/8. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 648 divided by 108 is 6, and 900 divided by 108 is 8.333... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.Let me try a different approach. Both 648 and 900 are divisible by 12. 648 divided by 12 is 54, and 900 divided by 12 is 75. So, now I have 54/75. Let's see if that can be simplified further. Both 54 and 75 are divisible by 3. 54 divided by 3 is 18, and 75 divided by 3 is 25. So, now I have 18/25. Is that the simplest form? 18 and 25 don't have any common divisors other than 1, so yes, 18/25 is the simplified fraction.Alternatively, I can express this as a decimal by dividing 18 by 25. 18 divided by 25 is 0.72. So, the probability is 0.72, or 72%.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the total number of three-digit numbers: 999 minus 100 plus 1 is indeed 900. That seems correct.For the number of favorable outcomes, I considered the hundreds digit as 1-9 (9 choices), the tens digit as 0-9 excluding the hundreds digit (9 choices), and the ones digit as 0-9 excluding the hundreds and tens digits (8 choices). Multiplying these together gives 9 * 9 * 8 = 648. That seems right.Then, dividing 648 by 900 gives 0.72, which is 72%, or 18/25 as a fraction. That all checks out.I think I initially made a mistake when trying to divide by 108 because I wasn't careful with the division. But breaking it down step by step and simplifying the fraction properly led me to the correct answer.So, to summarize, the probability that a randomly chosen three-digit number has all different digits is 18/25, or 72%."},{"question":"What is the nearest integer to (3+sqrt5)^4?","answer":"To find the nearest integer to ((3 + sqrt{5})^4), I can use the Binomial Theorem to expand the expression. However, directly expanding it might be cumbersome. Instead, I can consider the conjugate pair ((3 + sqrt{5})) and ((3 - sqrt{5})).

What is the minimum number of points that could be marked?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 6 lines drawn on a plane, and each line has exactly 3 marked points. I need to figure out the minimum number of points that could be marked. Hmm, let's see.First, if I think about it, if each line has 3 points, and there are 6 lines, it might seem like we need 6 times 3, which is 18 points. But that's probably not the case because some points can lie on multiple lines. So, the key here is to find a configuration where the points are shared among the lines as much as possible.I remember something about projective geometry and configurations where points lie on multiple lines. Maybe something like a grid or a triangle with medians? Let me think.If I consider a triangle, it has 3 vertices and 3 midpoints. That gives me 6 points. But wait, each side of the triangle would have 2 vertices and 1 midpoint, right? So, each side has 3 points. That's good. But then, if I also consider the medians, which connect the vertices to the midpoints, each median would also have 3 points: the vertex, the midpoint, and the centroid where the medians intersect.So, adding the centroid, that's 7 points in total. Let me check if this works. Each of the 3 sides of the triangle has 3 points: two vertices and a midpoint. Each of the 3 medians also has 3 points: a vertex, a midpoint, and the centroid. So, that's 6 lines, each with exactly 3 points, and only 7 distinct points in total.Wait, does that cover all 6 lines? Yes, because the triangle has 3 sides and 3 medians, making 6 lines. And each line has exactly 3 points. So, this seems to satisfy the condition.Is there a way to have fewer than 7 points? Let me think. If I try to use only 6 points, each line would have to share points more efficiently. But in the triangle with midpoints and centroid, we already have each point lying on multiple lines. The centroid is on all three medians, and each midpoint is on one side and one median. The vertices are on two sides and one median each.If I try to reduce it to 6 points, maybe some points would have to lie on more lines, but I don't think that's possible without violating the condition that each line has exactly 3 points. Because if a point is on too many lines, it might cause some lines to have more than 3 points.Alternatively, maybe a different configuration? Like a grid? If I have a 3x3 grid, that's 9 points, but that's more than 7, so it's not better. Or maybe a hexagon? A regular hexagon has 6 points, but each line would have only 2 points unless we add intersections, which would complicate things.Wait, another idea: what if I use a complete quadrilateral? A complete quadrilateral has 4 lines and 6 points, but we need 6 lines. Maybe extending that idea? But I'm not sure.Alternatively, think about the Fano plane, which is a configuration in finite projective geometry with 7 points and 7 lines, each line containing 3 points. But we only need 6 lines, so maybe a similar idea but with one line missing. But I'm not sure if that would reduce the number of points.Wait, in the Fano plane, each point is on 3 lines, but in our case, each line has 3 points. So, it's a bit different. Maybe the Fano plane is overkill here.Going back to the triangle idea, it seems like the most straightforward way to get 6 lines with 3 points each using only 7 points. I don't think you can do it with fewer because each line needs 3 unique points, and with 6 lines, you need some overlap, but not too much that you end up with more points.So, I think the minimum number of points is 7."},{"question":"Given the complex number Z= frac{1- sqrt{3}i}{ sqrt{3}+i}, where overset{ .}{Z} is the conjugate of Z, find Z cdot overset{ .}{Z}=(    ).A: frac{1}{2}B: frac{1}{4}C: 4D: 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this complex number Z, which is given as (1 - √3i) divided by (√3 + i). And I need to find the product of Z and its conjugate, which is denoted by Z with a dot on top. The options are A: 1/2, B: 1/4, C: 4, and D: 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for any complex number Z, the product of Z and its conjugate is equal to the square of the modulus of Z. So, Z multiplied by its conjugate gives |Z|². That might be a useful property here. But maybe I should first simplify Z to make things easier.Z is (1 - √3i)/(√3 + i). To simplify this, I think I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of √3 + i is √3 - i. So, if I multiply both numerator and denominator by √3 - i, I can eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator.Let me write that out:Z = [(1 - √3i)(√3 - i)] / [(√3 + i)(√3 - i)]Okay, let's compute the denominator first because that should be straightforward. The denominator is (√3 + i)(√3 - i). That's a difference of squares, so it should be (√3)² - (i)². Calculating that, (√3)² is 3, and i² is -1. So, 3 - (-1) is 3 + 1, which is 4. So the denominator simplifies to 4.Now, the numerator is (1 - √3i)(√3 - i). Let me expand this using the distributive property.First, multiply 1 by √3, which is √3. Then, 1 times (-i) is -i. Next, -√3i times √3 is -√3 * √3 * i. √3 times √3 is 3, so that term becomes -3i. Then, -√3i times (-i) is +√3i². Since i² is -1, that term becomes +√3*(-1) = -√3.Putting it all together, the numerator is:√3 - i - 3i - √3Wait, let me check that again. So, 1*√3 is √3, 1*(-i) is -i, -√3i*√3 is -3i, and -√3i*(-i) is +√3i², which is -√3. So, combining like terms:√3 - √3 cancels out, right? So √3 - √3 is 0. Then, -i - 3i is -4i. So the numerator simplifies to -4i.So now, Z is (-4i)/4, which simplifies to -i. So Z is just -i.Now, the conjugate of Z, which is denoted by Z with a dot, is the conjugate of -i. The conjugate of a purely imaginary number like -i is just i. So, Z conjugate is i.Now, we need to find Z multiplied by its conjugate. So, that's (-i) * (i). Multiplying these together, we get (-i)*(i) = -i². Since i² is -1, this becomes -(-1) = 1.So, Z multiplied by its conjugate is 1. Looking back at the options, D is 1. So the answer should be D.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Z = (1 - √3i)/(√3 + i). I multiplied numerator and denominator by √3 - i, which is correct because that's the conjugate. The denominator became 4, which seems right. The numerator, when expanded, gave me -4i, which seems correct as well. So Z is -i, its conjugate is i, and their product is 1. Yeah, that all checks out.Alternatively, I remember that for any complex number Z, Z multiplied by its conjugate is |Z|². So, maybe I can compute |Z|² directly without simplifying Z first. Let's see.The modulus of Z is |Z| = |(1 - √3i)/(√3 + i)|. The modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli, so |Z| = |1 - √3i| / |√3 + i|.Calculating |1 - √3i|: that's sqrt(1² + (√3)²) = sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2.Calculating |√3 + i|: that's sqrt((√3)² + 1²) = sqrt(3 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2.So |Z| = 2 / 2 = 1. Therefore, |Z|² = 1² = 1. So, Z multiplied by its conjugate is 1. That confirms the earlier result.So, yeah, both methods give me the same answer, which is 1. So I'm confident that D is the correct option.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"What is the arithmetic mean of all integers from -6 through 8, inclusive?

There are 11 cards, each labeled with a unique number from the set ({3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}).Next, I identify the prime numbers in this set.

Determine the range of values for the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The sufficient but not necessary condition for ( x > 1 ) to hold is ( x > a ). Determine the range of values for the real number ( a ).\\" Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.First, I remember that in logic, a sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement must be true. But it's not necessary, which means the statement can still be true even if the condition isn't met. So, in this case, ( x > a ) is a sufficient condition for ( x > 1 ). That means if ( x > a ), then ( x > 1 ) must be true. But since it's not necessary, there can be cases where ( x > 1 ) is true even if ( x > a ) is not.Let me break this down. If ( x > a ) is sufficient for ( x > 1 ), then every time ( x ) is greater than ( a ), it must also be greater than 1. So, ( a ) must be such that ( a ) is less than or equal to 1. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. If ( a ) is less than or equal to 1, then ( x > a ) could include values where ( x ) is between ( a ) and 1, which wouldn't necessarily be greater than 1. So, that can't be right.Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. If ( x > a ) is sufficient for ( x > 1 ), then whenever ( x > a ), it must imply ( x > 1 ). So, ( a ) must be greater than or equal to 1. Because if ( a ) is greater than or equal to 1, then ( x > a ) would automatically mean ( x > 1 ). But hold on, the problem says it's not a necessary condition. That means there are some ( x ) where ( x > 1 ) is true, but ( x > a ) is not. So, there must be some ( x ) values between 1 and ( a ) where ( x > 1 ) is true, but ( x > a ) is false. Therefore, ( a ) must be greater than 1. Because if ( a ) were equal to 1, then ( x > a ) would be equivalent to ( x > 1 ), making it both sufficient and necessary, which contradicts the problem statement.So, putting it all together, ( a ) must be greater than 1. That way, ( x > a ) implies ( x > 1 ), making it a sufficient condition, but since ( a ) is greater than 1, there are values of ( x ) between 1 and ( a ) where ( x > 1 ) is true without ( x > a ) being true, which makes it not a necessary condition.Let me double-check. If ( a = 2 ), then ( x > 2 ) implies ( x > 1 ), which is true. But ( x > 1 ) can be true for ( x = 1.5 ), which is not greater than 2. So, that works. If ( a = 1 ), then ( x > 1 ) is both sufficient and necessary, which isn't what we want. If ( a < 1 ), say ( a = 0.5 ), then ( x > 0.5 ) doesn't necessarily imply ( x > 1 ), because ( x ) could be 0.75, which is greater than 0.5 but not greater than 1. So, that doesn't satisfy the sufficiency condition.Therefore, ( a ) must be greater than 1. So, the range of values for ( a ) is all real numbers greater than 1, which can be written as ( a > 1 ) or in interval notation as ( (1, infty) ).I think that makes sense. Let me summarize:- Sufficient condition: ( x > a ) implies ( x > 1 ). So, ( a ) must be ≤ 1? Wait, no, earlier I thought ( a ) must be ≥ 1. Hmm, maybe I confused myself.Wait, no. If ( x > a ) implies ( x > 1 ), then ( a ) must be ≤ 1. Because if ( a ) is ≤ 1, then any ( x ) greater than ( a ) would have to be greater than 1. But that contradicts the necessity part. Wait, no, if ( a ) is ≤ 1, then ( x > a ) could include values less than or equal to 1, which would not satisfy ( x > 1 ). So, that can't be.Wait, maybe I need to think about it again. If ( x > a ) is sufficient for ( x > 1 ), then whenever ( x > a ), ( x > 1 ) must hold. So, ( a ) must be ≥ 1. Because if ( a ) is ≥ 1, then ( x > a ) would mean ( x > 1 ). But if ( a ) is < 1, then ( x > a ) could include values where ( x ) is between ( a ) and 1, which wouldn't satisfy ( x > 1 ), so the implication wouldn't hold.But then, if ( a ) is ≥ 1, and the condition is not necessary, that means there are some ( x ) where ( x > 1 ) is true but ( x > a ) is false. So, ( x ) must be between 1 and ( a ). Therefore, ( a ) must be > 1, because if ( a = 1 ), then ( x > a ) would be equivalent to ( x > 1 ), making it both sufficient and necessary, which we don't want.So, yes, ( a ) must be greater than 1. So, the range is ( a > 1 ), or ( (1, infty) ).I think I've got it now. So, the answer is that ( a ) must be greater than 1."},{"question":"A gecko eats 70 crickets every three days.

The problem gives me the arc length, which is denoted by ( l ), and the radius of the sector, denoted by ( r ). It also mentions that I should use an analogy with the formula for the area of a triangle, which is ( S = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ). The question is asking me to figure out the formula for the area of the sector, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D.First, I need to recall what a sector is. A sector is like a \\"slice\\" of a circle, bounded by two radii and an arc. The area of a sector is a portion of the entire area of the circle, just like how a triangle's area is a portion of a larger shape, maybe? Hmm, not sure if that's the right way to think about it, but let's go with it.The problem says to use the formula for the area of a triangle as an analogy. So, in a triangle, the area is half the base times the height. The base is one side of the triangle, and the height is the perpendicular distance from that base to the opposite vertex. So, if I can find an analogous \\"base\\" and \\"height\\" in a sector, maybe I can derive the area formula similarly.In the case of a sector, the two radii are like two sides, and the arc is the curved edge. So, if I think of the arc as the \\"base\\" of the sector, then what would be the \\"height\\"? Well, in a triangle, the height is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex. In a sector, the distance from the arc to the center of the circle is just the radius, right? Because the radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle, including the arc.So, if I consider the arc length ( l ) as the \\"base\\" and the radius ( r ) as the \\"height,\\" then by analogy, the area of the sector should be ( frac{1}{2} times l times r ). That makes sense because it's similar to the triangle area formula, just substituting the arc length for the base and the radius for the height.Let me double-check that. The standard formula for the area of a sector is ( frac{1}{2} r^2 theta ), where ( theta ) is the central angle in radians. But in this problem, they're giving me the arc length ( l ) instead of the angle. I remember that arc length ( l ) is related to the radius and the central angle by the formula ( l = r theta ). So, if I solve for ( theta ), I get ( theta = frac{l}{r} ).Substituting that back into the area formula, I get ( frac{1}{2} r^2 times frac{l}{r} ). Simplifying that, the ( r ) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving ( frac{1}{2} r l ), which is the same as ( frac{1}{2} l r ). So, that confirms it. The area of the sector is indeed ( frac{1}{2} l r ).Looking back at the options given:A: ( frac{r^2}{2} )  B: ( frac{l^2}{2} )  C: ( frac{1}{2} l r )  D: ( l r )So, option C matches the formula I derived. That must be the correct answer.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me think about this another way. If I consider the entire circle, its circumference is ( 2pi r ), and its area is ( pi r^2 ). The ratio of the arc length ( l ) to the circumference ( 2pi r ) gives me the fraction of the circle that the sector represents. So, the area of the sector should be that fraction multiplied by the total area of the circle.Mathematically, that would be ( frac{l}{2pi r} times pi r^2 ). Simplifying that, the ( pi ) cancels out, and one ( r ) cancels out as well, leaving ( frac{l r}{2} ), which is again ( frac{1}{2} l r ). So, that's another way to arrive at the same formula, reinforcing that option C is correct.I think I've covered this from multiple angles now. The analogy with the triangle area formula, substituting the arc length and radius, and also using the proportion of the circle's circumference. All of them lead me to the conclusion that the area of the sector is ( frac{1}{2} l r ). Therefore, the correct answer is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water.

Let me try to figure out each part step by step.Starting with part (1): The equation of the ellipse is given as (x²/a²) + y² = 1, where a > 1. The origin is O, and there's a line l that intersects the ellipse at points A and B. M is the midpoint of segment AB. It says that A and B are respectively the left and top vertices of the ellipse. Hmm, so the left vertex of the ellipse should be at (-a, 0), and the top vertex should be at (0, 1) because the standard ellipse equation is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, but here b² is 1, so b is 1. So, A is (-a, 0) and B is (0, 1).Now, M is the midpoint of AB. So, the coordinates of M would be the average of the coordinates of A and B. That would be ((-a + 0)/2, (0 + 1)/2) = (-a/2, 1/2).The slope of OM is given as -1/2. OM is the line from the origin O(0,0) to M(-a/2, 1/2). So, the slope is (1/2 - 0)/(-a/2 - 0) = (1/2)/(-a/2) = -1/a.But the problem states that this slope is -1/2. So, -1/a = -1/2. Solving for a, we get a = 2.Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse E is (x²/4) + y² = 1.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. If a = 2, then the left vertex is (-2, 0), top vertex is (0, 1). Midpoint M is (-1, 0.5). The slope from O(0,0) to M(-1, 0.5) is (0.5)/(-1) = -0.5, which is -1/2. Yep, that matches the given slope. So, part (1) seems correct.Moving on to part (2): Now, a = 2, so the ellipse equation is (x²/4) + y² = 1. We need to find the maximum area of triangle AOB, given that |OM| = 1.First, let's recall that O is the origin, and A and B are points where line l intersects the ellipse. M is the midpoint of AB, and the distance from O to M is 1.I need to find the maximum area of triangle AOB. The area of triangle AOB can be found using the determinant formula: (1/2)|x1*y2 - x2*y1|, where A is (x1, y1) and B is (x2, y2).Alternatively, since the area can also be expressed as (1/2)*base*height. If I can express the area in terms of the coordinates of A and B, maybe I can maximize it.But since M is the midpoint, maybe it's easier to parametrize the line l and use the condition |OM| = 1.Let me try parametrizing the line l. Let's assume the line l has a slope m, so its equation can be written as y = m x + c. But since it's a general line, maybe it's better to write it in terms of parameters.Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to write the line in terms of a parameter t, but perhaps using the midpoint condition.Wait, another approach is to use the concept of the equation of chord with a given midpoint. For an ellipse, the equation of the chord with midpoint (h, k) is given by (T = S1), where T is the tangent equation at (h, k) and S1 is the value of the ellipse equation at (h, k).But since M is the midpoint, we can use that. Let me recall the formula.For an ellipse (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, the equation of the chord with midpoint (h, k) is (h x)/a² + (k y)/b² = (h²)/a² + (k²)/b².In our case, a² = 4, b² = 1. So, the equation of chord AB with midpoint M(h, k) is (h x)/4 + (k y) = (h²)/4 + k².But we also know that this chord is the line l, which intersects the ellipse at A and B. So, the equation of line l is (h x)/4 + (k y) = (h²)/4 + k².But we also know that the distance from the origin O to M(h, k) is 1. So, sqrt(h² + k²) = 1, which gives h² + k² = 1.So, we have two equations:1. (h x)/4 + (k y) = (h²)/4 + k²2. h² + k² = 1Our goal is to find the maximum area of triangle AOB.But perhaps we can express the area in terms of h and k, and then maximize it under the constraint h² + k² = 1.Alternatively, maybe it's better to parametrize the line in terms of slope and intercept.Let me try that approach.Let me assume the line l has the equation y = m x + c. It intersects the ellipse (x²/4) + y² = 1.Substituting y = m x + c into the ellipse equation:(x²)/4 + (m x + c)² = 1Expanding:x²/4 + m² x² + 2 m c x + c² - 1 = 0Combine like terms:(1/4 + m²) x² + 2 m c x + (c² - 1) = 0This is a quadratic in x. Let the roots be x1 and x2, corresponding to points A and B.Then, the sum of roots x1 + x2 = - (2 m c) / (1/4 + m²) = - (8 m c) / (1 + 4 m²)The product of roots x1 x2 = (c² - 1) / (1/4 + m²) = (4 (c² - 1)) / (1 + 4 m²)Similarly, the midpoint M has coordinates ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Since y = m x + c, y1 + y2 = m(x1 + x2) + 2 c.So, the coordinates of M are:x_M = (x1 + x2)/2 = (-8 m c) / [2(1 + 4 m²)] = (-4 m c) / (1 + 4 m²)y_M = (y1 + y2)/2 = [m(x1 + x2) + 2 c]/2 = [m*(-8 m c)/(1 + 4 m²) + 2 c]/2Simplify y_M:= [ (-8 m² c)/(1 + 4 m²) + 2 c ] / 2= [ (-8 m² c + 2 c (1 + 4 m²)) / (1 + 4 m²) ] / 2= [ (-8 m² c + 2 c + 8 m² c ) / (1 + 4 m²) ] / 2= [ 2 c / (1 + 4 m²) ] / 2= c / (1 + 4 m²)So, M has coordinates:x_M = (-4 m c)/(1 + 4 m²)y_M = c/(1 + 4 m²)Given that |OM| = 1, so sqrt(x_M² + y_M²) = 1Compute x_M² + y_M²:= [ (16 m² c²) / (1 + 4 m²)^2 ] + [ c² / (1 + 4 m²)^2 ]= (16 m² c² + c²) / (1 + 4 m²)^2= c² (16 m² + 1) / (1 + 4 m²)^2Set equal to 1:c² (16 m² + 1) / (1 + 4 m²)^2 = 1So,c² = (1 + 4 m²)^2 / (16 m² + 1)That's equation (1).Now, we need to find the area of triangle AOB. The area can be found using the determinant formula:Area = (1/2) |x1 y2 - x2 y1|But since A and B lie on the line y = m x + c, we can express y1 and y2 in terms of x1 and x2.So, y1 = m x1 + cy2 = m x2 + cThus,Area = (1/2) |x1 (m x2 + c) - x2 (m x1 + c)|= (1/2) |x1 m x2 + x1 c - x2 m x1 - x2 c|= (1/2) |(x1 m x2 - x2 m x1) + (x1 c - x2 c)|= (1/2) |0 + c (x1 - x2)|= (1/2) |c| |x1 - x2|So, Area = (1/2) |c| |x1 - x2|We can express |x1 - x2| in terms of the quadratic equation we had earlier.From quadratic equation: (1/4 + m²) x² + 2 m c x + (c² - 1) = 0The discriminant D = (2 m c)^2 - 4*(1/4 + m²)*(c² - 1)= 4 m² c² - (1 + 4 m²)(c² - 1)Expand the second term:= 4 m² c² - [ (c² - 1) + 4 m² (c² - 1) ]= 4 m² c² - c² + 1 - 4 m² c² + 4 m²Simplify:= (4 m² c² - 4 m² c²) + (-c²) + (1 + 4 m²)= -c² + 1 + 4 m²So, D = (1 + 4 m²) - c²Thus, |x1 - x2| = sqrt(D) / |a|, where a is the coefficient of x², which is (1/4 + m²)So,|x1 - x2| = sqrt(D) / (1/4 + m²) = sqrt(1 + 4 m² - c²) / (1/4 + m²)Therefore, Area = (1/2) |c| * sqrt(1 + 4 m² - c²) / (1/4 + m²)But from equation (1), we have c² = (1 + 4 m²)^2 / (16 m² + 1)Let me denote c² as that:c² = (1 + 4 m²)^2 / (16 m² + 1)So, let me compute 1 + 4 m² - c²:= 1 + 4 m² - (1 + 4 m²)^2 / (16 m² + 1)Let me compute this:Let me write 1 + 4 m² as A, so A = 1 + 4 m²Then, 1 + 4 m² - c² = A - A² / (16 m² + 1)But 16 m² + 1 = 4*(4 m²) + 1 = 4*(A - 1) + 1 = 4 A - 4 + 1 = 4 A - 3Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's compute it directly.Compute numerator:(1 + 4 m²)(16 m² + 1) - (1 + 4 m²)^2= (16 m² + 1 + 64 m^4 + 4 m²) - (1 + 8 m² + 16 m^4)= (64 m^4 + 20 m² + 1) - (16 m^4 + 8 m² + 1)= 64 m^4 + 20 m² + 1 - 16 m^4 - 8 m² - 1= 48 m^4 + 12 m²So,1 + 4 m² - c² = (48 m^4 + 12 m²) / (16 m² + 1)Factor numerator:= 12 m² (4 m² + 1) / (16 m² + 1)So,sqrt(1 + 4 m² - c²) = sqrt[12 m² (4 m² + 1) / (16 m² + 1)] = sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / sqrt(16 m² + 1)So, putting it all together, the Area is:(1/2) * |c| * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / sqrt(16 m² + 1) / (1/4 + m²)But c² = (1 + 4 m²)^2 / (16 m² + 1), so |c| = (1 + 4 m²) / sqrt(16 m² + 1)Thus,Area = (1/2) * (1 + 4 m²)/sqrt(16 m² + 1) * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / sqrt(16 m² + 1) / (1/4 + m²)Simplify step by step.First, let's write all terms:= (1/2) * (1 + 4 m²) / sqrt(16 m² + 1) * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / sqrt(16 m² + 1) / (1/4 + m²)Combine the denominators:= (1/2) * (1 + 4 m²) * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / (16 m² + 1) / (1/4 + m²)Note that 1/4 + m² = (1 + 4 m²)/4So, 1/(1/4 + m²) = 4 / (1 + 4 m²)Thus,Area = (1/2) * (1 + 4 m²) * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / (16 m² + 1) * 4 / (1 + 4 m²)Simplify:= (1/2) * 4 * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / (16 m² + 1)= 2 * sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) / (16 m² + 1)Simplify sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)):= sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) = m sqrt(12 (4 m² + 1)) = m * sqrt(48 m² + 12)Wait, but 12 m² (4 m² + 1) = 48 m^4 + 12 m²So, sqrt(48 m^4 + 12 m²) = sqrt(12 m² (4 m² + 1)) = m sqrt(12 (4 m² + 1))But m can be positive or negative, but since we're dealing with area, which is positive, we can consider m positive without loss of generality.So, Area = 2 * m sqrt(12 (4 m² + 1)) / (16 m² + 1)Simplify sqrt(12 (4 m² + 1)):= sqrt(12) * sqrt(4 m² + 1) = 2 sqrt(3) sqrt(4 m² + 1)Thus,Area = 2 * m * 2 sqrt(3) sqrt(4 m² + 1) / (16 m² + 1)= 4 sqrt(3) m sqrt(4 m² + 1) / (16 m² + 1)Let me denote t = m², so t ≥ 0.Then, Area becomes:4 sqrt(3) sqrt(t) sqrt(4 t + 1) / (16 t + 1)Let me write this as:4 sqrt(3) sqrt(t (4 t + 1)) / (16 t + 1)Let me compute t (4 t + 1) = 4 t² + tSo, Area = 4 sqrt(3) sqrt(4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can square the area to make it easier to maximize.Let S = Area, so S² = [4 sqrt(3) sqrt(4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)]²= 16 * 3 * (4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)^2= 48 (4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)^2So, S² = 48 (4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)^2Let me denote u = 16 t + 1. Then, t = (u - 1)/16So, 4 t² + t = 4 [(u - 1)/16]^2 + (u - 1)/16= 4 (u² - 2 u + 1)/256 + (u - 1)/16= (u² - 2 u + 1)/64 + (u - 1)/16= (u² - 2 u + 1 + 4 u - 4)/64= (u² + 2 u - 3)/64So, S² = 48 * (u² + 2 u - 3)/64 / u²= 48/64 * (u² + 2 u - 3)/u²= (3/4) * (u² + 2 u - 3)/u²= (3/4) [1 + 2/u - 3/u²]Hmm, not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe another substitution.Alternatively, let me set v = 16 t + 1, so t = (v - 1)/16But maybe instead, let me consider t as a variable and try to find the maximum of S².So, S² = 48 (4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)^2Let me compute the derivative of S² with respect to t and set it to zero to find the maximum.Let f(t) = (4 t² + t) / (16 t + 1)^2Compute f'(t):Using quotient rule,f'(t) = [ (8 t + 1)(16 t + 1)^2 - (4 t² + t)(2)(16 t + 1)(16) ] / (16 t + 1)^4Simplify numerator:Let me factor out (16 t + 1):= (16 t + 1) [ (8 t + 1)(16 t + 1) - 32 (4 t² + t) ]Compute inside the brackets:First term: (8 t + 1)(16 t + 1) = 128 t² + 8 t + 16 t + 1 = 128 t² + 24 t + 1Second term: 32 (4 t² + t) = 128 t² + 32 tSubtract: (128 t² + 24 t + 1) - (128 t² + 32 t) = -8 t + 1Thus, numerator = (16 t + 1)(-8 t + 1)Set f'(t) = 0, so numerator = 0:(16 t + 1)(-8 t + 1) = 0Solutions: 16 t + 1 = 0 => t = -1/16 (discarded since t ≥ 0)Or, -8 t + 1 = 0 => t = 1/8So, critical point at t = 1/8.We need to check if this gives a maximum.Compute second derivative or test intervals.But since it's the only critical point in t ≥ 0, and as t approaches infinity, f(t) approaches (4 t²)/(256 t²) = 1/64, which is less than f(1/8). So, it's likely a maximum.Compute f(1/8):f(1/8) = (4*(1/8)^2 + 1/8) / (16*(1/8) + 1)^2= (4*(1/64) + 1/8) / (2 + 1)^2= (1/16 + 1/8) / 9= (3/16) / 9= 1/48Thus, S² = 48 * f(t) = 48 * (1/48) = 1So, S² = 1 => S = 1Therefore, the maximum area is 1.Wait, so the maximum area of triangle AOB is 1.Let me verify this result.Given that when t = 1/8, which is m² = 1/8, so m = ±1/(2√2)Then, c² = (1 + 4*(1/8))² / (16*(1/8) + 1) = (1 + 0.5)^2 / (2 + 1) = (2.25)/3 = 0.75So, c = ±√(0.75) = ±(√3)/2 ≈ ±0.866Then, the line l is y = (±1/(2√2)) x ± (√3)/2The midpoint M is:x_M = (-4 m c)/(1 + 4 m²) = (-4*(±1/(2√2))*(±√3/2)) / (1 + 4*(1/8)) = (-4*(1/(2√2))*(√3/2)) / (1 + 0.5) = (-4*(√3)/(4√2)) / 1.5 = (-√3/√2) / 1.5 = (-√(3/2)) / 1.5 = (-√6)/3 ≈ -0.816Similarly, y_M = c / (1 + 4 m²) = (√3/2) / 1.5 = (√3/2) / (3/2) = √3/3 ≈ 0.577So, M is approximately (-0.816, 0.577), and |OM| = sqrt(0.816² + 0.577²) ≈ sqrt(0.666 + 0.333) = sqrt(1) = 1, which matches the condition.Then, the area is 1, as calculated.So, the maximum area is indeed 1.**Final Answer**(1) The standard equation of ellipse ( E ) is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}).(2) The maximum area of triangle ( triangle AOB ) is (boxed{1})."},{"question":"Calculate: sqrt[3]{8}+frac{1}{{2+sqrt{5}}}-(frac{1}{3})^{-2}+|sqrt{5}-3|.","answer":"Alright, so I have this expression to calculate: the cube root of 8 plus 1 divided by (2 plus the square root of 5) minus (1/3) to the power of -2 plus the absolute value of (square root of 5 minus 3). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.First, the cube root of 8. Okay, I know that the cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. So, what number multiplied by itself three times equals 8? Well, 2 times 2 is 4, and 4 times 2 is 8. So, the cube root of 8 is 2. Got that part.Next up is 1 divided by (2 plus the square root of 5). This looks a bit tricky because of the square root in the denominator. I remember that to simplify expressions like this, we can rationalize the denominator. That means getting rid of the square root in the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (2 plus the square root of 5) is (2 minus the square root of 5). So, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by that.Let's do that:1/(2 + sqrt(5)) * (2 - sqrt(5))/(2 - sqrt(5)) = (2 - sqrt(5))/[(2 + sqrt(5))(2 - sqrt(5))]Now, let's simplify the denominator. When we multiply (2 + sqrt(5)) by (2 - sqrt(5)), it's a difference of squares, so it becomes 2 squared minus (sqrt(5)) squared. That's 4 minus 5, which is -1. So, the denominator simplifies to -1.So now, the expression becomes (2 - sqrt(5))/(-1), which is the same as - (2 - sqrt(5)) or sqrt(5) - 2. Okay, that simplifies nicely.Moving on, we have minus (1/3) to the power of -2. Negative exponents mean reciprocals, so (1/3)^-2 is the same as (3/1)^2, which is 9. So, this term simplifies to -9.Lastly, we have the absolute value of (sqrt(5) minus 3). The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, so it's always non-negative. Now, sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, which is less than 3. So, sqrt(5) minus 3 is a negative number, and the absolute value of that would be 3 minus sqrt(5).Alright, let's put all these simplified terms back into the original expression:Cube root of 8: 21/(2 + sqrt(5)): sqrt(5) - 2-(1/3)^-2: -9|sqrt(5) - 3|: 3 - sqrt(5)So, putting it all together:2 + (sqrt(5) - 2) - 9 + (3 - sqrt(5))Now, let's combine like terms. First, the constants: 2 - 2 - 9 + 3. That simplifies to (2 - 2) + (-9 + 3) = 0 + (-6) = -6.Then, the terms with sqrt(5): sqrt(5) - sqrt(5). That cancels out to 0.So, combining both parts, we get -6 + 0 = -6.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:Cube root of 8 is definitely 2. Rationalizing 1/(2 + sqrt(5)) gives sqrt(5) - 2, which seems correct. (1/3)^-2 is 9, so minus that is -9. Absolute value of sqrt(5) - 3 is 3 - sqrt(5). Adding them all up: 2 + (sqrt(5) - 2) - 9 + (3 - sqrt(5)). Yep, the sqrt(5) terms cancel out, and the constants add up to -6.I think that's right. So, the final answer should be -6."},{"question":"A large box contains some small boxes and each small box contains 25 chocolate bars. There are 375 chocolate bars in the large box.

Each small box contains 25 chocolate bars, and the large box has a total of 375 chocolate bars.To find the number of small boxes, I can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of chocolate bars in each small box.So, I'll divide 375 by 25 to get the number of small boxes."},{"question":"What is the smallest integer value of x for which 3-5x>24?","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: 3 minus 5x is greater than 24. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that solving inequalities is somewhat similar to solving equations, but there are some rules I need to keep in mind, especially when dealing with negative numbers.First, I want to isolate the term with the variable x. The inequality is 3 - 5x > 24. To get rid of that 3 on the left side, I can subtract 3 from both sides. Let me write that down:3 - 5x > 24Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:-5x > 21Okay, so now I have -5x > 21. The next step is to solve for x by dividing both sides by -5. But wait, I remember that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign flips. So, I need to reverse the inequality.Dividing both sides by -5:x < 21 / (-5)Calculating that, 21 divided by 5 is 4.2, so 21 divided by -5 is -4.2. Therefore, the inequality becomes:x < -4.2Now, the question asks for the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality. Since x has to be less than -4.2, the integers less than -4.2 are -5, -6, -7, and so on. The smallest integer here is -5 because it's the first integer less than -4.2.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 3 - 5x > 24, subtracting 3 gives -5x > 21. Dividing by -5 and flipping the inequality gives x < -4.2. The smallest integer less than -4.2 is indeed -5. So, I think I did this correctly.Just to be thorough, I can plug x = -5 back into the original inequality to verify:3 - 5*(-5) = 3 + 25 = 28Is 28 greater than 24? Yes, it is. So, x = -5 works.What if I tried x = -4? Let's see:3 - 5*(-4) = 3 + 20 = 23Is 23 greater than 24? No, it's not. So, x = -4 doesn't satisfy the inequality, which confirms that -5 is the smallest integer that works.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. It seems correct."},{"question":"A sum of money was lent out at simple interest and at the end of 1 year and 8 months, the total amount of Rs 500 is received.

The points given are A at (15, 3), B at (0, 0), and D at (6, 8). The options are ranges between certain numbers, so I need to figure out which range the sum falls into.First, I remember that to find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, I can use the distance formula. The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which is ( sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} ). So, I can apply this formula to both AD and BD.Let me start with BD since point B is at the origin, which might make the calculations simpler. Point B is (0, 0) and point D is (6, 8). Plugging these into the distance formula:( BD = sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} )Calculating the differences first:( 6 - 0 = 6 )( 8 - 0 = 8 )Now, squaring these differences:( 6^2 = 36 )( 8^2 = 64 )Adding them together:( 36 + 64 = 100 )Taking the square root of 100:( sqrt{100} = 10 )So, BD is 10 units. That was straightforward.Next, I need to find AD. Point A is at (15, 3) and point D is at (6, 8). Again, using the distance formula:( AD = sqrt{(15 - 6)^2 + (3 - 8)^2} )Calculating the differences:( 15 - 6 = 9 )( 3 - 8 = -5 ) (but since we're squaring it, the negative won't matter)Squaring these differences:( 9^2 = 81 )( (-5)^2 = 25 )Adding them together:( 81 + 25 = 106 )Taking the square root of 106:Hmm, I know that ( sqrt{100} = 10 ) and ( sqrt{121} = 11 ), so ( sqrt{106} ) should be somewhere between 10 and 11. To get a better estimate, I can note that 106 is 6 more than 100, so it's closer to 10 than 11. Maybe around 10.3 or something? But since I just need to know the range, I can keep it as ( sqrt{106} ) for now.Now, I need to find the sum of AD and BD. So, that's:( AD + BD = sqrt{106} + 10 )Since ( sqrt{106} ) is approximately 10.3, adding 10 gives me about 20.3. But let me think if I can get a more precise estimate without a calculator.I know that ( 10^2 = 100 ) and ( 10.3^2 = 106.09 ). Wait, that's actually more than 106. So, ( sqrt{106} ) is slightly less than 10.3. Maybe around 10.295 or something. But for the purposes of this problem, knowing it's between 10 and 11 is enough.So, adding BD (which is 10) to AD (which is between 10 and 11), the total sum should be between 20 and 21. Therefore, the sum of AD and BD is between 20 and 21.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For BD:- Coordinates of B: (0,0)- Coordinates of D: (6,8)- Distance: ( sqrt{(6)^2 + (8)^2} = sqrt{36 + 64} = sqrt{100} = 10 ). That seems correct.For AD:- Coordinates of A: (15,3)- Coordinates of D: (6,8)- Distance: ( sqrt{(15-6)^2 + (3-8)^2} = sqrt{9^2 + (-5)^2} = sqrt{81 + 25} = sqrt{106} ). That also seems correct.Adding them together: 10 + ( sqrt{106} ). Since ( sqrt{106} ) is approximately 10.3, the total is approximately 20.3, which is between 20 and 21.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations."},{"question":"Winston had 10 gallons of gas in his car’s gas tank. He drives to the store and uses 6 gallons of gas. Then he drives to the doctor’s office and uses 2 gallons of gas. If the tank can hold up to 12 gallons of gas, how many gallons of gas will Winston need to refill the entire tank?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Winston and his car's gas tank. Let me try to understand what's going on here. First, Winston starts with 10 gallons of gas in his tank. That's clear. Then he drives to the store and uses 6 gallons of gas. After that, he drives to the doctor's office and uses another 2 gallons. The question is asking how many gallons of gas Winston needs to refill his entire tank, given that the tank can hold up to 12 gallons.Alright, let's break this down step by step. 1. **Starting Point:** Winston begins with 10 gallons in his tank. So, initially, the tank has 10 gallons.2. **Driving to the Store:** He uses 6 gallons to get to the store. So, I need to subtract 6 gallons from the initial 10 gallons to find out how much gas he has left after this trip.   So, 10 gallons minus 6 gallons equals... let's see... 10 - 6 = 4 gallons. Okay, so after driving to the store, he has 4 gallons left.3. **Driving to the Doctor's Office:** Next, he drives to the doctor's office and uses another 2 gallons. Now, I need to subtract these 2 gallons from the remaining 4 gallons.   So, 4 gallons minus 2 gallons equals... 4 - 2 = 2 gallons. Therefore, after both trips, Winston has 2 gallons of gas left in his tank.4. **Tank Capacity:** The problem also mentions that the tank can hold up to 12 gallons. So, the maximum amount of gas the tank can contain is 12 gallons.5. **Refilling the Tank:** Now, the question is asking how many gallons Winston needs to refill the entire tank. That means we need to find out how much gas is needed to go from the current amount (which is 2 gallons) up to the full capacity (12 gallons).   To find this, I can subtract the current amount of gas from the tank's capacity.   So, 12 gallons (total capacity) minus 2 gallons (current amount) equals... 12 - 2 = 10 gallons.Therefore, Winston needs to add 10 gallons of gas to his tank to refill it completely.Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.- Starting gas: 10 gallons.- After store trip: 10 - 6 = 4 gallons.- After doctor's office trip: 4 - 2 = 2 gallons.- Tank capacity: 12 gallons.- Gas needed to refill: 12 - 2 = 10 gallons.Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, (cos 210^circ = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).Finally, I conclude that (cos frac{7pi}{6} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2})."},{"question":"If the complex number (m^{2}-m)+mi is purely imaginary, then the value of the real number m is ({ })A: -1B: 0C: 1D: 2","answer":"First, I recognize that a complex number is purely imaginary if its real part is zero and its imaginary part is non-zero.Given the complex number ((m^{2} - m) + mi), the real part is (m^{2} - m) and the imaginary part is (m).To satisfy the condition of being purely imaginary:1. The real part must be zero: (m^{2} - m = 0).2. The imaginary part must be non-zero: (m neq 0).Solving the equation (m^{2} - m = 0):- Factor the equation: (m(m - 1) = 0).- This gives two solutions: (m = 0) or (m = 1).Since (m neq 0) (to ensure the imaginary part is non-zero), the only valid solution is (m = 1).Therefore, the value of (m) is (1)."},{"question":"Suppose P bottles of water can be bought from a dispenser for R dollars.

Since 1 euro is worth 1.2 dollars, I can convert the amount in euros to dollars by multiplying by 1.2.Next, there's a 10% discount when buying with euros. This means that for every dollar spent, I get an additional 10% value. To account for this discount, I'll multiply the converted dollar amount by 1.1.Now, I can set up a proportion to find out how many bottles can be bought with the discounted dollar amount. If P bottles cost R dollars, then the number of bottles (y) that can be bought with the discounted amount is given by:[frac{P}{R} = frac{y}{1.2M times 1.1}]Solving for y, I get:[y = frac{P times 1.2M times 1.1}{R}]Simplifying this expression, I find:[y = frac{1.32PM}{R}]Finally, I verify that the units and calculations make sense, confirming that the number of bottles is correctly represented by this expression."},{"question":"Victoria had 500. She went to the market and bought some packets of rice each at 20, 3 packets of wheat flour each at 25, and 1 soda at 150. Her remaining balance was 235. How many packets of rice did she buy?","answer":"First, I need to determine how much money Victoria spent in total. She started with 500 and had a remaining balance of 235, so the total amount spent is 500 - 235 = 265.Next, I'll calculate the cost of the wheat flour and the soda. She bought 3 packets of wheat flour at 25 each, which totals 3 * 25 = 75. She also bought 1 soda for 150. Adding these together, the total cost for wheat flour and soda is 75 + 150 = 225.Now, I'll find out how much money was spent on rice by subtracting the cost of wheat flour and soda from the total amount spent: 265 - 225 = 40.Finally, to determine the number of rice packets bought, I'll divide the amount spent on rice by the cost per packet: 40 / 20 = 2. Therefore, Victoria bought 2 packets of rice."},{"question":"Compare the sizes: -frac{3}{4} ____ -frac{3}{5}.","answer":"First, I need to compare the sizes of (-frac{3}{4}) and (-frac{3}{5}).To do this, I'll start by finding the absolute values of both numbers. The absolute value of (-frac{3}{4}) is (frac{3}{4}), and the absolute value of (-frac{3}{5}) is (frac{3}{5}).Next, I'll compare these absolute values. (frac{3}{4}) is equal to (0.75), and (frac{3}{5}) is equal to (0.6). Since (0.75) is greater than (0.6), (frac{3}{4}) is larger than (frac{3}{5}).However, because both original numbers are negative, the number with the larger absolute value is actually smaller. Therefore, (-frac{3}{4}) is less than (-frac{3}{5}).So, the comparison is (-frac{3}{4} < -frac{3}{5})."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: [left(xy-2right)left(xy+2right)-2x^{2}y^{2}+4]div left(-xyright), where x=frac{1}{8} and y=-4.","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify and evaluate: [(xy - 2)(xy + 2) - 2x²y² + 4] divided by (-xy), and I need to plug in x = 1/8 and y = -4. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that when you see something like (a - b)(a + b), it's a difference of squares, which simplifies to a² - b². So maybe I can apply that here. Let me try that with (xy - 2)(xy + 2). If I let a = xy and b = 2, then it becomes (xy)² - (2)², which is x²y² - 4. Okay, that seems right.So replacing that part in the original expression, I get [x²y² - 4 - 2x²y² + 4]. Now, let me simplify inside the brackets. I have x²y² - 4 - 2x²y² + 4. Combining like terms, x²y² - 2x²y² is -x²y², and -4 + 4 cancels out to 0. So the expression inside the brackets simplifies to -x²y².Now, the whole expression is this simplified bracket divided by (-xy). So it's (-x²y²) divided by (-xy). Let me write that as a fraction: (-x²y²) / (-xy). I can simplify this by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator.First, the negatives: - divided by - is positive. So that becomes positive x²y² divided by xy. Now, x² divided by x is x, and y² divided by y is y. So x²y² divided by xy is xy. So the entire expression simplifies to xy.Alright, so now I just need to plug in x = 1/8 and y = -4 into xy. Let's do that: (1/8) * (-4). Multiplying 1/8 by -4, I get -4/8, which simplifies to -1/2. So the final answer should be -1/2.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning: (xy - 2)(xy + 2) is indeed x²y² - 4. Then subtracting 2x²y² and adding 4 gives x²y² - 4 - 2x²y² + 4, which simplifies to -x²y². Dividing that by -xy gives (-x²y²)/(-xy) = xy. Plugging in x = 1/8 and y = -4, I get (1/8)*(-4) = -1/2. Yeah, that seems correct.I think I've got it right. The key was recognizing the difference of squares and then simplifying step by step. It's easy to make a mistake with the signs, especially with the negatives, but I think I handled them correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is -1/2."},{"question":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?A: The reciprocal of -frac{1}{3} is -3B: (-2)-(-6)=4C: a^{2}+b^{2} represents the square of the sum of a and bD: frac{1}{2}pi r^{2} is a second-degree monomial","answer":"Okay, so I have this question here that asks me to determine which of the given statements is incorrect. The options are labeled A through D, and each one makes a different claim about some mathematical concept. Let me go through each one step by step to figure out which one is wrong.Starting with statement A: \\"The reciprocal of -1/3 is -3.\\" Hmm, reciprocals. I remember that the reciprocal of a number is just 1 divided by that number. So, if I take -1/3 and find its reciprocal, I should flip the numerator and the denominator. That would give me -3/1, which simplifies to -3. So, yes, the reciprocal of -1/3 is indeed -3. That seems correct. So, A is correct.Moving on to statement B: \\"(-2) - (-6) = 4.\\" Okay, subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So, (-2) minus (-6) is like (-2) plus 6. Let me do that calculation: -2 + 6 equals 4. Yep, that's right. So, B is also correct.Now, statement C: \\"a² + b² represents the square of the sum of a and b.\\" Hmm, wait a minute. The square of the sum of a and b would be (a + b)², right? Let me expand that. (a + b)² equals a² + 2ab + b². So, that's different from just a² + b². The a² + b² expression doesn't include the 2ab term. Therefore, a² + b² doesn't represent the square of the sum of a and b; it's just the sum of their squares. So, statement C is incorrect.Just to be thorough, let me check statement D: \\"(1/2)πr² is a second-degree monomial.\\" A monomial is an algebraic expression with one term. Here, we have (1/2)πr², which is a single term. The degree of a monomial is the highest power of the variable in it. In this case, the variable is r, and it's squared, so the degree is 2. Therefore, (1/2)πr² is indeed a second-degree monomial. So, D is correct.So, after going through each statement, I can confidently say that statement C is the incorrect one because a² + b² doesn't represent the square of the sum of a and b—it's missing the 2ab term."},{"question":"In 1979, approximately 1/3 of the 37.3 million airline passengers traveling to or from the United States used Kennedy airport.

It says that this equation has two real roots, (x_1) and (x_2), and there's this condition given: (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5). I need to find the value of (m). Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for any quadratic equation of the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), the sum of the roots (x_1 + x_2) is equal to (-b/a), and the product of the roots (x_1x_2) is (c/a). In this case, the equation is (x^2 - 5x + m = 0), so (a = 1), (b = -5), and (c = m). So, applying the formulas:- Sum of roots: (x_1 + x_2 = -b/a = -(-5)/1 = 5)- Product of roots: (x_1x_2 = c/a = m/1 = m)Alright, so I know that (x_1 + x_2 = 5) and (x_1x_2 = m). Now, the problem also gives me another equation involving the roots: (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5). I need to use this to find (m).Hmm, so I have two equations:1. (x_1 + x_2 = 5)2. (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5)I think I can solve this system of equations to find (x_1) and (x_2), and then use their product to find (m).Let me write down the two equations:1. (x_1 + x_2 = 5)2. (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5)I can use the method of elimination or substitution. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let me try that.First, I'll label the equations for clarity:- Equation (1): (x_1 + x_2 = 5)- Equation (2): (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5)I need to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate (x_2). To do that, I can multiply Equation (1) by 2 so that the coefficients of (x_2) in both equations will be opposites.Multiplying Equation (1) by 2:- Equation (1a): (2x_1 + 2x_2 = 10)Now, I'll add Equation (1a) to Equation (2) to eliminate (x_2):- Equation (1a): (2x_1 + 2x_2 = 10)- Equation (2): (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5)- Adding them together: (2x_1 + 3x_1 + 2x_2 - 2x_2 = 10 + 5)- Simplifying: (5x_1 = 15)So, (5x_1 = 15) implies (x_1 = 3).Now that I have (x_1 = 3), I can substitute this back into Equation (1) to find (x_2):- Equation (1): (3 + x_2 = 5)- Subtracting 3 from both sides: (x_2 = 2)Great, so the roots are (x_1 = 3) and (x_2 = 2).Now, recalling that the product of the roots (x_1x_2 = m), I can calculate (m):- (m = x_1x_2 = 3 times 2 = 6)So, the value of (m) is 6.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I'll plug (x_1 = 3) and (x_2 = 2) back into the original equations to verify.First, checking the sum:- (x_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5), which matches the sum from the quadratic equation.Next, checking the product:- (x_1x_2 = 3 times 2 = 6), so (m = 6), which seems correct.Also, let's verify the condition (3x_1 - 2x_2 = 5):- (3(3) - 2(2) = 9 - 4 = 5), which satisfies the given condition.Everything checks out. So, I'm confident that (m = 6) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of (m) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"( n ) is a 4-digit number with non-zero tens digit. If the first two digits and the last two digits of ( n ) are treated as separate two-digit numbers, find all such ( n ) such that the product of these two-digit numbers is a factor of ( n ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all four-digit numbers, n, such that when I split n into the first two digits (let's call that A) and the last two digits (let's call that B), the product of A and B is a factor of n. Also, the tens digit of n is non-zero, which probably means that B can't be something like 01 or 00 because the tens digit is the second digit from the right, so B can't start with zero. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. If n is a four-digit number, say 1234, then A would be 12 and B would be 34. The product of A and B is 12 * 34 = 408. Then, I need to check if 408 is a factor of 1234. If it is, then 1234 is one of the numbers we're looking for. But in this case, 408 doesn't divide 1234 evenly, so 1234 wouldn't be a solution. Got it. So, I need to find all such four-digit numbers where this condition holds.Let me try to formalize this a bit. Let n be a four-digit number, so n can be expressed as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is not zero because it's a four-digit number. Also, the tens digit, which is c, is non-zero, so c ≠ 0.But maybe it's easier to think of n as 100A + B, where A is the first two digits (a two-digit number) and B is the last two digits (another two-digit number). So, A ranges from 10 to 99, and B ranges from 10 to 99 as well because the tens digit is non-zero. So, n = 100A + B. We need to find all n such that A * B divides n, meaning that (A * B) | (100A + B). So, mathematically, we can write this as:(100A + B) mod (A * B) = 0Which implies that (100A + B) is divisible by (A * B). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express this as:(100A + B) / (A * B) must be an integer.Let me denote k = (100A + B) / (A * B). So, k must be an integer. Let me rearrange this equation:100A + B = k * A * BLet me divide both sides by A:100 + B/A = k * BBut B/A might not be an integer, so maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, let me try to express B in terms of A.From 100A + B = k * A * B, let's solve for B:100A = k * A * B - B100A = B(kA - 1)So, B = (100A) / (kA - 1)Since B must be an integer, (kA - 1) must divide 100A. So, (kA - 1) divides 100A. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can think about possible values of k. Since A and B are two-digit numbers, their product A*B can be as small as 10*10=100 and as large as 99*99=9801. But n is a four-digit number, so n is between 1000 and 9999. Therefore, A*B must be a factor of n, which is between 1000 and 9999. So, A*B must be between 100 and 9999.But since n = 100A + B, and A and B are two-digit numbers, n is at least 100*10 + 10 = 1010 and at most 100*99 + 99 = 9999. So, n is indeed a four-digit number.Let me think about possible values of k. Since k = (100A + B)/(A*B), let's see what k could be.Given that n = 100A + B, and A*B is a factor of n, k must be an integer. Let's see:If A and B are both around 50, then A*B is around 2500, and n is around 5050. So, k would be around 2. If A and B are smaller, say around 20, then A*B is 400, and n is around 2020, so k would be around 5. If A and B are larger, say around 90, then A*B is 8100, and n is around 9090, so k would be around 1.12, which is not an integer. So, k is likely to be a small integer, maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.But let's see if we can find a better way. Let me go back to the equation:B = (100A)/(kA - 1)Since B must be an integer, (kA - 1) must divide 100A. So, (kA - 1) divides 100A.Let me denote d = kA - 1, so d divides 100A, which means that d divides 100A. Also, since d = kA - 1, we can write d ≡ -1 mod A. So, d divides 100A and d ≡ -1 mod A.This seems a bit abstract, but maybe I can think about possible values of k.Let me try k=1:If k=1, then d = A - 1. So, d divides 100A, which means A - 1 divides 100A. Since A - 1 divides 100A, and A and A - 1 are coprime (because consecutive integers are coprime), A - 1 must divide 100. So, A - 1 is a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. But since A is a two-digit number, A - 1 can be from 9 (if A=10) up to 98 (if A=99). So, possible A - 1 values are 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. But A - 1 must be less than 99, so 100 is excluded. So, A - 1 can be 10, 20, 25, 50.Thus, A can be 11, 21, 26, 51.Let me check each:A=11: Then d = 11 - 1 = 10. So, B = (100*11)/10 = 110. But B must be a two-digit number, so 110 is invalid. So, A=11 is not a solution.A=21: d=20. B=(100*21)/20=105. Again, B=105 is invalid.A=26: d=25. B=(100*26)/25=104. Again, B=104 is invalid.A=51: d=50. B=(100*51)/50=102. Again, B=102 is invalid.So, k=1 doesn't give any valid solutions because B becomes a three-digit number, which is not allowed.Okay, let's try k=2:Then d = 2A - 1. So, d divides 100A, and d = 2A - 1.Again, since d divides 100A and d = 2A - 1, which is coprime with A (because 2A -1 and A share no common divisors except 1). So, d must divide 100.Thus, 2A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.So, 2A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:2A -1 = 1 => 2A=2 => A=1. But A must be two-digit, so invalid.2A -1 = 2 => 2A=3 => A=1.5. Not integer.2A -1 =4 => 2A=5 => A=2.5. Not integer.2A -1=5 => 2A=6 => A=3. Invalid.2A -1=10 => 2A=11 => A=5.5. Not integer.2A -1=20 => 2A=21 => A=10.5. Not integer.2A -1=25 => 2A=26 => A=13. Valid.2A -1=50 => 2A=51 => A=25.5. Not integer.2A -1=100 => 2A=101 => A=50.5. Not integer.So, only A=13 is valid when 2A -1=25.So, A=13, d=25, B=(100*13)/25=52.So, B=52. So, n=100*13 +52=1352.Let me check if 13*52 divides 1352.13*52=676. 1352 divided by 676 is 2, which is an integer. So, yes, 1352 is a solution.Okay, so k=2 gives us n=1352.Let's try k=3:d=3A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=3A -1, which is coprime with A (because 3A -1 and A share no common divisors except 1), d must divide 100.So, 3A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 3A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:3A -1=1 => 3A=2 => A=2/3. Not integer.3A -1=2 => 3A=3 => A=1. Invalid.3A -1=4 => 3A=5 => A=5/3. Not integer.3A -1=5 => 3A=6 => A=2. Invalid.3A -1=10 => 3A=11 => A=11/3.

Not integer.So, only A=17 is valid when 3A -1=50.So, A=17, d=50, B=(100*17)/50=34.So, B=34. So, n=100*17 +34=1734.Let me check if 17*34 divides 1734.17*34=578. 1734 divided by 578 is 3, which is an integer. So, yes, 1734 is a solution.Okay, so k=3 gives us n=1734.Let's try k=4:d=4A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=4A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 4A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 4A -1 must be one of these.

So, d divides 100A, and since d=5A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 5A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 5A -1 must be one of these.

Not integer.So, no valid A for k=5.Let me try k=6:d=6A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=6A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 6A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 6A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:6A -1=1 => 6A=2 => A=1/3. Not integer.6A -1=2 => 6A=3 => A=0.5. Not integer.6A -1=4 => 6A=5 => A=5/6. Not integer.6A -1=5 => 6A=6 => A=1. Invalid.6A -1=10 => 6A=11 => A=11/6≈1.833.

Not integer.So, no valid A for k=6.Hmm, maybe k=7:d=7A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=7A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 7A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 7A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:7A -1=1 => 7A=2 => A=2/7≈0.285. Not integer.7A -1=2 => 7A=3 => A=3/7≈0.428. Not integer.7A -1=4 => 7A=5 => A=5/7≈0.714. Not integer.7A -1=5 => 7A=6 => A=6/7≈0.857. Not integer.7A -1=10 => 7A=11 => A=11/7≈1.571. Not integer.7A -1=20 => 7A=21 => A=3. Valid.So, A=3, but A must be a two-digit number, so invalid.7A -1=25 => 7A=26 => A=26/7≈3.714. Not integer.7A -1=50 => 7A=51 => A=51/7≈7.285. Not integer.7A -1=100 => 7A=101 => A=101/7≈14.428. Not integer.So, only A=3 is possible, but it's invalid as a two-digit number. So, no solution for k=7.Let me try k=8:d=8A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=8A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 8A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 8A -1 must be one of these.

Not integer.8A -1=100 => 8A=101 => A=101/8=12.625. Not integer.So, no valid A for k=8.Let me try k=9:d=9A -1. So, d divides 100A, and since d=9A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 9A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 9A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:9A -1=1 => 9A=2 => A=2/9≈0.222. Not integer.9A -1=2 => 9A=3 => A=1/3≈0.333. Not integer.9A -1=4 => 9A=5 => A=5/9≈0.555. Not integer.9A -1=5 => 9A=6 => A=2/3≈0.666.

So, d divides 100A, and since d=10A -1, which is coprime with A, d must divide 100.So, 10A -1 must be a divisor of 100.Divisors of 100 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.So, 10A -1 must be one of these. Let's solve for A:10A -1=1 => 10A=2 => A=0.2. Not integer.10A -1=2 => 10A=3 => A=0.3. Not integer.10A -1=4 => 10A=5 => A=0.5. Not integer.10A -1=5 => 10A=6 => A=0.6.

Not integer.10A -1=100 => 10A=101 => A=10.1. Not integer.So, no valid A for k=10.I think I've tried k from 1 to 10, and only k=2 and k=3 gave valid solutions. Let me check if there are any higher k values that might work, but considering that A and B are two-digit numbers, k can't be too large because A*B would be too big compared to n=100A + B.For example, if k=11:d=11A -1. So, d divides 100A, and d=11A -1 must divide 100.But 11A -1 must be a divisor of 100, which is unlikely because 11A -1 would be at least 11*10 -1=109, which is larger than 100, so no solution.Similarly, higher k values would make d= kA -1 larger than 100, so no solutions.So, I think the only solutions are n=1352 and n=1734.Let me double-check these:For n=1352:A=13, B=52. A*B=13*52=676. 1352 divided by 676 is 2, which is an integer. So, yes.For n=1734:A=17, B=34. A*B=17*34=578. 1734 divided by 578 is 3, which is an integer. So, yes.I think these are the only solutions."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} whose first three terms are x-1, x+1, and 2x+3, find the general formula for this sequence.","answer":"First, I need to determine the value of ( x ) by using the property of an arithmetic sequence that the difference between consecutive terms is constant.Given the first three terms:[a_1 = x - 1, quad a_2 = x + 1, quad a_3 = 2x + 3]The common difference ( d ) can be expressed as:[d = a_2 - a_1 = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = 2][d = a_3 - a_2 = (2x + 3) - (x + 1) = x + 2]Setting the two expressions for ( d ) equal to each other:[2 = x + 2 implies x = 0]Substituting ( x = 0 ) into the first term:[a_1 = 0 - 1 = -1]Now, using the common difference ( d = 2 ), the general formula for the ( n )-th term of the arithmetic sequence is:[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = -1 + (n - 1) times 2 = 2n - 3]"},{"question":"Gilda has a bag of marbles.

Prove that exist some numbers  a_i  with the sum is  2n .","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here: There are 2n elements, each from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 2n-1}, and their total sum is 4n. I need to prove that there's some subset of these elements that adds up to exactly 2n. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have 2n numbers, each between 1 and 2n-1, and when you add them all up, you get 4n. I need to show that among these numbers, there's a group that sums to 2n. That seems like it should be possible, but I need to figure out exactly why.Maybe I can use some kind of averaging argument. If the total sum is 4n, then the average of these 2n numbers is 2. So, on average, each number is 2. But since the numbers are all positive integers, some are going to be higher than 2, and some lower. Maybe that can help me find a subset that adds up to 2n.Wait, another thought: Maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If I consider all possible subsets, there are 2^{2n} of them, which is a lot. But the possible sums range from 1 to 4n. Maybe if I look at the sums modulo something, like modulo 2n, I can find two subsets with the same sum, and then their difference would give me a subset summing to 2n. Hmm, that might work.Let me try that. If I look at all possible subset sums modulo 2n, there are 2n possible remainders (from 0 to 2n-1). There are 2^{2n} subsets, which is way more than 2n, so by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two subsets with the same remainder when divided by 2n. If I subtract these two subsets, the difference would be a subset whose sum is divisible by 2n. But I need a subset that sums exactly to 2n, not just a multiple of 2n.Hmm, okay, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem. I remember it says that for any 2n-1 integers, there exists a subset of n integers whose sum is divisible by n. Wait, but in our case, we have 2n numbers, not 2n-1. Maybe I can still apply a similar idea.If I consider the first n numbers, by the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem, there must be a subset of these n numbers whose sum is divisible by n. Let's say that sum is kn for some integer k. Similarly, for the last n numbers, there must be another subset whose sum is ln for some integer l.Now, the total sum of all 2n numbers is 4n, so kn + ln = 4n. That means k + l = 4. So, possible values for k and l are (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). If either k or l is 2, then we have a subset summing to 2n, which is exactly what we need. If k and l are both 1 or both 3, then maybe we can combine subsets or do something else.Wait, if k=1 and l=3, then the first subset sums to n and the second subset sums to 3n. But the total sum is 4n, so the remaining numbers after taking the first subset would sum to 3n, which is the same as the second subset. But that doesn't directly help me. Maybe I need to consider overlapping subsets or something.Alternatively, maybe I can use induction. Let's see. For n=2, we have 4 numbers from {1,2,3}, summing to 8. Let's check if there's a subset summing to 4. For example, if the numbers are 1,1,3,3, then 1+3=4. If they are 2,2,2,2, then 2+2=4. Seems to work. For n=3, 6 numbers from {1,2,3,4,5}, summing to 12. I need a subset summing to 6. Let's see, possible combinations: 1+2+3=6, 1+5=6, 2+4=6, etc. Seems likely.But induction might get complicated because I have to assume it's true for n and prove for n+1, but the structure might not carry over easily. Maybe another approach.What if I try to construct such a subset? Since the average is 2, maybe I can pair numbers. For example, if I have a number greater than 2, I can pair it with a number less than 2 to balance it out. But since all numbers are at least 1, pairing might not directly give me 2n.Wait, another idea: Maybe use the fact that the total sum is 4n, which is twice 2n. So, if I can partition the set into two subsets, each summing to 2n, that would work. But the problem only asks for the existence of one subset, not necessarily a partition. But if I can find one subset summing to 2n, the rest would automatically sum to 2n as well, since 4n - 2n = 2n.So, maybe I can use some kind of partitioning argument. Let me think about it. If I can show that it's possible to split the set into two equal halves, each summing to 2n, then I'm done. But how?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of complementary subsets. For any subset S, its complement has sum 4n - sum(S). So, if I can find a subset S such that sum(S) = 2n, then its complement also sums to 2n. So, maybe I can use some kind of fixed-point theorem or something.Wait, another thought: Maybe use the pigeonhole principle on the partial sums. Let's consider the partial sums of the sequence. If I start adding numbers one by one, keeping track of the cumulative sum modulo 2n. There are 2n possible remainders. If at any point the cumulative sum is 2n, then we're done. If not, by the pigeonhole principle, two partial sums must have the same remainder modulo 2n. The difference between these two partial sums would then be a multiple of 2n, meaning the subset between them sums to 2n. But wait, that's similar to what I thought earlier.But in this case, the partial sums are being considered, and if any partial sum is 2n, we're done. If not, then two partial sums must be congruent modulo 2n, so their difference is a multiple of 2n. But since all numbers are positive, the difference would be at least 2n, but the total sum is 4n, so the difference could be 2n or 4n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's 4n, that would mean the entire set sums to 4n, which it does, but that doesn't help us find a subset.Hmm, so maybe this approach can find a subset summing to 2n or 4n. Since 4n is the total sum, the subset summing to 4n is the entire set, which isn't helpful. So, maybe this approach doesn't directly give us the desired subset.Wait, but if we consider the partial sums modulo 2n, and if none of them is 0 modulo 2n (which would correspond to a subset summing to 2n), then by the pigeonhole principle, two partial sums must be equal modulo 2n. The difference between these two would be a multiple of 2n, but as we saw, it could be 2n or 4n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's 4n, that's the entire set, which doesn't help.But since the total sum is 4n, which is 0 modulo 2n, maybe we can adjust the approach. Let me think. If I include the empty set as a partial sum, which is 0, then if any partial sum is 2n, we're done. If not, then among the 2n+1 partial sums (including the empty set), there are 2n possible remainders modulo 2n. So, by the pigeonhole principle, two partial sums must be equal modulo 2n. The difference between these two would be a multiple of 2n, which could be 2n or 4n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's 4n, that would mean the entire set is the subset, which isn't helpful.But wait, the problem states that n > 3, so maybe there's a way to ensure that the difference isn't 4n. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try an example. Suppose n=2, so 2n=4, and the numbers are from {1,2,3}. The total sum is 8. Let's say the numbers are 1,1,3,3. The partial sums would be 0,1,2,5,8. Modulo 4, these are 0,1,2,1,0. So, we have two partial sums equal to 0 modulo 4: the empty set and the entire set. The difference is 8, which is 4n, so not helpful. But we also have two partial sums equal to 1 modulo 4: the first number and the third number. The difference is 3, which isn't 4. Hmm, but in this case, we can find a subset summing to 4: 1+3=4.Wait, but in this example, the partial sums didn't directly give me the subset, but the subset exists. So maybe the pigeonhole principle approach isn't sufficient on its own, but combined with other ideas, it can help.Let me go back to the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem. It says that for any 2n-1 integers, there's a subset of n integers whose sum is divisible by n. In our case, we have 2n numbers, so maybe we can apply this theorem twice. First, on the first n numbers, there's a subset of size k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) whose sum is divisible by n. Similarly, on the last n numbers, there's a subset of size l (1 ≤ l ≤ n) whose sum is divisible by n.Let me denote the sum of the first subset as kn and the second subset as ln. Then, kn + ln = 4n, so k + l = 4. The possible pairs (k,l) are (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). If either k or l is 2, then we have a subset summing to 2n, which is what we need. If both are 1 or both are 3, then maybe we can combine subsets or do something else.Wait, if k=1 and l=3, then the first subset sums to n and the second subset sums to 3n. But the total sum is 4n, so the remaining numbers after taking the first subset would sum to 3n, which is the same as the second subset. But that doesn't directly help me. Maybe I can take the union of the first subset and some part of the second subset.Alternatively, if k=3 and l=1, similar situation. Maybe I can take the intersection or something. Hmm, not sure.Wait, another idea: If I have a subset summing to n and another subset summing to 3n, then the union of these two subsets would sum to 4n, which is the total sum. But that doesn't help me find a subset summing to 2n. Maybe I need to consider overlapping elements or something.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the numbers are from 1 to 2n-1. So, each number is at most 2n-1, which is less than 2n. So, if I have a subset summing to 2n, it must contain at least two numbers, because the maximum single number is 2n-1, which is less than 2n.Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if n=2, 2n=4, and 3 is less than 4, but 1+3=4. So, in that case, it's two numbers. For n=3, 2n=6, and numbers go up to 5. So, 1+5=6, 2+4=6, etc. So, in general, a subset summing to 2n can be as small as two numbers.But how does that help me? Maybe I can look for pairs that add up to 2n. But since the numbers are from 1 to 2n-1, each number x has a complement 2n - x. So, for each x, there's a y such that x + y = 2n. But since the numbers are from 1 to 2n-1, y would be in the same range.But wait, in our case, we have 2n numbers, each from 1 to 2n-1, summing to 4n. So, maybe there's a way to pair them up such that each pair sums to 2n. But that would require exactly n pairs, each summing to 2n, which would make the total sum 2n * n = 2n^2. But our total sum is 4n, which is much smaller unless n=2. So, that approach doesn't work.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider the average again. The average is 2, so maybe I can find a subset where the average is 2, which would mean the sum is 2n. But how?Wait, another idea: Maybe use the concept of balancing. Since the total sum is 4n, if I can find a subset that's \\"balanced\\" around the average, it might sum to 2n. But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, going back to the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem, maybe I can apply it in a different way. The theorem says that for any 2n-1 integers, there's a subset of n integers summing to a multiple of n. But we have 2n integers, so maybe we can apply the theorem to subsets of size n and n.Wait, let me try this: Consider the first n numbers. By the theorem, there's a subset of size k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) summing to kn. Similarly, for the last n numbers, there's a subset of size l (1 ≤ l ≤ n) summing to ln. Then, kn + ln = 4n, so k + l = 4. If either k or l is 2, we're done. If not, then k and l are 1 and 3 or 3 and 1.If k=1 and l=3, then the first subset sums to n and the second subset sums to 3n. But the total sum is 4n, so the remaining numbers after taking the first subset would sum to 3n, which is the same as the second subset. But how does that help me? Maybe I can take the union of the first subset and some part of the second subset.Wait, if I take the first subset (sum n) and add some elements from the second subset, maybe I can reach 2n. Since the second subset sums to 3n, which is more than 2n, maybe I can find a subset within the second subset that sums to n, and then combine it with the first subset.But wait, the second subset already sums to 3n, which is more than 2n. So, maybe I can find a subset within the second subset that sums to n, and then combine it with the first subset to get 2n. But how do I know such a subset exists?Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the second subset has sum 3n, which is more than 2n, so there must be some elements in it that can be removed to reduce the sum to 2n. But I'm not sure if that's guaranteed.Wait, another approach: Maybe consider all possible subset sums. Since we have 2n numbers, the number of possible non-empty subsets is 2^{2n} - 1, which is a lot. The possible sums range from 1 to 4n. So, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be some overlap in sums. But how does that help me find a specific sum of 2n?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the total sum is 4n, so if I can find a subset summing to 2n, its complement will also sum to 2n. So, maybe I can use some kind of fixed-point theorem or something.Wait, another idea: Maybe use induction on n. For n=2, as I checked earlier, it works. Assume it's true for n=k, then prove for n=k+1. But I'm not sure how to set up the induction step.Wait, let me try to think of it differently. Since the average is 2, maybe I can find a subset where the sum is exactly 2n by balancing the numbers. For example, if I have a number greater than 2, I can pair it with a number less than 2 to balance it out. But since all numbers are at least 1, pairing might not directly give me 2n.Wait, another thought: Maybe use the concept of complementary subsets. For any subset S, its complement has sum 4n - sum(S). So, if I can find a subset S such that sum(S) = 2n, then its complement also sums to 2n. So, maybe I can use some kind of fixed-point theorem or something.Wait, going back to the partial sums idea. If I consider the partial sums modulo 2n, there are 2n possible remainders. If any partial sum is 0 modulo 2n, then we're done. If not, by the pigeonhole principle, two partial sums must be equal modulo 2n. The difference between these two would be a multiple of 2n, which could be 2n or 4n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's 4n, that's the entire set, which isn't helpful.But since the total sum is 4n, which is 0 modulo 2n, maybe we can adjust the approach. Let me think. If I include the empty set as a partial sum, which is 0, then if any partial sum is 2n, we're done. If not, then among the 2n+1 partial sums (including the empty set), there are 2n possible remainders modulo 2n. So, by the pigeonhole principle, two partial sums must be equal modulo 2n. The difference between these two would be a multiple of 2n, which could be 2n or 4n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's 4n, that would mean the entire set is the subset, which isn't helpful.But wait, the problem states that n > 3, so maybe there's a way to ensure that the difference isn't 4n. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try an example. Suppose n=2, so 2n=4, and the numbers are from {1,2,3}. The total sum is 8. Let's say the numbers are 1,1,3,3. The partial sums would be 0,1,2,5,8. Modulo 4, these are 0,1,2,1,0. So, we have two partial sums equal to 0 modulo 4: the empty set and the entire set. The difference is 8, which is 4n, so not helpful. But we also have two partial sums equal to 1 modulo 4: the first number and the third number. The difference is 3, which isn't 4. Hmm, but in this case, we can find a subset summing to 4: 1+3=4.Wait, but in this example, the partial sums didn't directly give me the subset, but the subset exists. So maybe the pigeonhole principle approach isn't sufficient on its own, but combined with other ideas, it can help.Let me try another approach. Since the total sum is 4n, and we have 2n numbers, maybe we can consider the sum of any n numbers. By the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem, there's a subset of n numbers whose sum is divisible by n. Let's say that sum is kn. Then, the remaining n numbers would sum to 4n - kn = (4 - k)n. If k=2, we're done. If k=1, then the remaining sum is 3n. If k=3, the remaining sum is n.If k=1, then we have a subset summing to n and another subset summing to 3n. Maybe we can find a subset within the 3n subset that sums to n, and then combine it with the first subset to get 2n. But how do we know such a subset exists?Wait, if we have a subset summing to 3n, which is more than 2n, maybe we can remove some elements to reduce it to 2n. But I'm not sure if that's guaranteed.Alternatively, maybe we can apply the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem again on the 3n subset. Since it has n elements, we can find a subset of size m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) summing to mn. If m=2, then we have a subset summing to 2n, which is what we need. If m=1, then we have a subset summing to n, and the remaining sum would be 2n, which is also what we need.Wait, that seems promising. So, if we have a subset summing to 3n, we can apply the theorem again to find a subset within it that sums to either n or 2n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's n, then the remaining sum is 2n, which is also what we need.Similarly, if we have a subset summing to n, we can apply the theorem to the remaining subset summing to 3n, and find a subset within it that sums to either n or 2n. If it's 2n, we're done. If it's n, then combining it with the first subset gives us 2n.So, in all cases, we can find a subset summing to 2n.

Calculate the length of the track in meters.A) 300 metersB) 350 metersC) 360 metersD) 400 metersE) 450 meters","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem where Sally and John are running on a circular track, starting from diametrically opposite points. They first meet after Sally has run 90 meters, and then they meet again after John has run an additional 200 meters past their first meeting point. I need to figure out the length of the track.Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, since they start diametrically opposite, the distance between them at the start is half the circumference of the track. Let's denote the length of the track as ( y ) meters. So, the initial distance between Sally and John is ( frac{y}{2} ) meters.When they meet for the first time, Sally has run 90 meters. That means John has run the remaining distance to meet her, which is ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters. So, at the first meeting point, Sally has run 90 meters, and John has run ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters.Now, after this first meeting, they continue running and meet again. The problem states that they meet again after John has run an additional 200 meters past their first meeting point. So, from the first meeting point, John runs 200 meters to reach the second meeting point.At this second meeting, the total distance John has run is ( frac{y}{2} - 90 + 200 = frac{y}{2} + 110 ) meters. Since they meet again, the total distance covered by both Sally and John from the first meeting point to the second meeting point should add up to the circumference of the track, which is ( y ) meters.So, if John has run 200 meters past the first meeting point, Sally must have run ( y - 200 ) meters past the first meeting point. Therefore, Sally's total distance from the start to the second meeting point is ( 90 + (y - 200) = y - 110 ) meters.Now, since both Sally and John are running at constant speeds, the ratio of their speeds should remain constant throughout their run. Let's denote Sally's speed as ( v_s ) and John's speed as ( v_j ).From the first meeting:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90}]From the second meeting:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{y - 110}{frac{y}{2} + 110}]Since the ratios are equal, we can set them equal to each other:[frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 110}{frac{y}{2} + 110}]Now, let's solve for ( y ). Cross-multiplying gives:[90 left( frac{y}{2} + 110 right) = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 110)]Expanding both sides:[90 times frac{y}{2} + 90 times 110 = frac{y}{2} times y - frac{y}{2} times 110 - 90 times y + 90 times 110]Simplifying:[45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 55y - 90y + 9900]Combine like terms:[45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900]Subtract ( 45y + 9900 ) from both sides:[0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y]Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:[0 = y^2 - 380y]Factor out ( y ):[0 = y(y - 380)]So, ( y = 0 ) or ( y = 380 ). Since a track can't have a length of 0 meters, the length must be 380 meters.Wait, but 380 meters isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my calculations again.Going back to the equation after cross-multiplying:[90 left( frac{y}{2} + 110 right) = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 110)]Expanding the right side:[left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right)(y - 110) = frac{y}{2} times y - frac{y}{2} times 110 - 90 times y + 90 times 110][= frac{y^2}{2} - 55y - 90y + 9900][= frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900]Left side:[90 left( frac{y}{2} + 110 right) = 45y + 9900]So, setting them equal:[45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900]Subtract ( 45y + 9900 ) from both sides:[0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y]Multiply by 2:[0 = y^2 - 380y]Factor:[0 = y(y - 380)]So, ( y = 0 ) or ( y = 380 ). Hmm, still getting 380, which isn't an option. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the first meeting, they continue running until they meet again, which means they've covered the entire circumference together. So, from the first meeting to the second meeting, Sally runs ( y - 200 ) meters, and John runs 200 meters. Therefore, the total distance covered between the two meetings is ( y ) meters.So, the time taken for them to meet again is the same for both runners. Let's denote this time as ( t ).So, Sally's speed ( v_s = frac{y - 200}{t} ) and John's speed ( v_j = frac{200}{t} ).From the first meeting, Sally had run 90 meters, and John had run ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters. So, their speeds are also ( v_s = frac{90}{t_1} ) and ( v_j = frac{frac{y}{2} - 90}{t_1} ), where ( t_1 ) is the time taken to meet the first time.Since their speeds are constant, the ratio of their speeds should be the same in both cases.So,[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Now, setting these equal:[frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 200)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 100y - 90y + 18000][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y + 18000]Subtract 18000 from both sides:[0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y]Multiply by 2:[0 = y^2 - 380y]Factor:[0 = y(y - 380)]Again, ( y = 0 ) or ( y = 380 ). Still getting 380, which isn't an option. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Let's consider the total distance covered by both runners when they meet the first time. Since they started half a track apart, the sum of their distances is ( frac{y}{2} ). So, Sally ran 90 meters, John ran ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters.When they meet the second time, they've covered another full circumference together, so the sum of their distances from the first meeting point is ( y ). John ran 200 meters, so Sally ran ( y - 200 ) meters.So, the ratio of their speeds is consistent:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 200)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 100y - 90y + 18000][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y + 18000]Subtract 18000:[0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y][0 = y^2 - 380y][y(y - 380) = 0]Still getting 380. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the second meeting occurs after John has run 200 meters from the start, not from the first meeting point. Let's try that.If John runs 200 meters from the start, then from the first meeting point, he has run ( 200 - (frac{y}{2} - 90) ) meters. But this complicates things. Maybe I need to set up equations differently.Let’s denote the time taken to meet the first time as ( t_1 ), and the time taken from the first meeting to the second meeting as ( t_2 ).From the first meeting:[v_s = frac{90}{t_1}][v_j = frac{frac{y}{2} - 90}{t_1}]From the second meeting:[v_s = frac{y - 200}{t_2}][v_j = frac{200}{t_2}]Since their speeds are constant:[frac{90}{t_1} = frac{y - 200}{t_2}][frac{frac{y}{2} - 90}{t_1} = frac{200}{t_2}]Dividing the first equation by the second:[frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Which is the same equation as before, leading to ( y = 380 ). Since 380 isn't an option, maybe I need to reconsider the problem statement.Wait, perhaps the second meeting occurs after John has run 200 meters past the first meeting point, meaning from the first meeting point, John runs 200 meters to meet Sally again. So, the total distance John has run from the start is ( frac{y}{2} - 90 + 200 = frac{y}{2} + 110 ) meters.Similarly, Sally has run ( 90 + (y - 200) = y - 110 ) meters from the start.So, the ratio of their speeds:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 110}{frac{y}{2} + 110}]Cross-multiplying:[90 left( frac{y}{2} + 110 right) = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 110)][45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 55y - 90y + 9900][45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900][45y = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y][45y + 145y = frac{y^2}{2}][190y = frac{y^2}{2}][380y = y^2][y^2 - 380y = 0][y(y - 380) = 0]Again, ( y = 380 ). This is consistent, but it's not one of the options. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the starting point. If they start diametrically opposite, the initial distance is ( frac{y}{2} ), but perhaps the total distance to meet again is ( y ), not ( frac{y}{2} ). Let's try that.If they start diametrically opposite, the first meeting occurs after they've covered ( frac{y}{2} ) together. So, Sally runs 90 meters, John runs ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters.Then, to meet again, they need to cover another ( y ) meters together. So, from the first meeting point, Sally runs ( y - 200 ) meters, and John runs 200 meters.Thus, the ratio of their speeds:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 200)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 100y - 90y + 18000][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y + 18000][0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y][0 = y^2 - 380y][y(y - 380) = 0]Still getting 380. Maybe the answer is 360 meters, which is option C, and I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me try plugging in 360 meters and see if it works.If ( y = 360 ), then the initial distance between them is ( 180 ) meters.First meeting: Sally runs 90 meters, John runs ( 180 - 90 = 90 ) meters.So, their speed ratio is ( frac{90}{90} = 1 ). They run at the same speed.After the first meeting, they continue running. Since they have the same speed, they will meet again after covering another half track, which is 180 meters. But the problem says they meet after John has run 200 meters past the first meeting point. If they run at the same speed, John would have run 180 meters to meet again, not 200. So, this doesn't add up.Wait, maybe I need to consider that after the first meeting, they continue running until they meet again, which is another full lap. So, the total distance covered between meetings is ( y ).If ( y = 360 ), then after the first meeting, Sally runs ( 360 - 200 = 160 ) meters, and John runs 200 meters. So, their speed ratio is ( frac{160}{200} = frac{4}{5} ).From the first meeting, Sally ran 90 meters, John ran 90 meters, so their speed ratio was ( 1 ). But now it's ( frac{4}{5} ). This inconsistency suggests ( y ) isn't 360.Maybe I need to set up the equations differently. Let's denote the time taken to meet the first time as ( t ). So, Sally's speed ( v_s = frac{90}{t} ), and John's speed ( v_j = frac{frac{y}{2} - 90}{t} ).After the first meeting, they continue running until they meet again. The time taken for this second meeting is ( t' ). In this time, John runs 200 meters, so ( v_j = frac{200}{t'} ). Sally runs ( y - 200 ) meters, so ( v_s = frac{y - 200}{t'} ).Since their speeds are constant:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 200)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 100y - 90y + 18000][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y + 18000][0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y][0 = y^2 - 380y][y(y - 380) = 0]Again, ( y = 380 ). It seems consistent, but it's not an option. Maybe the problem is intended to have a different interpretation. Perhaps the second meeting occurs after John has run 200 meters from the start, not from the first meeting point.If that's the case, then John has run a total of 200 meters from the start, which means from the first meeting point, he has run ( 200 - (frac{y}{2} - 90) = 200 - frac{y}{2} + 90 = 290 - frac{y}{2} ) meters.Similarly, Sally has run ( 90 + (y - 200) = y - 110 ) meters from the start.So, the ratio of their speeds:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 110}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 110)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 55y - 90y + 9900][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900][frac{y^2}{2} - 145y - 8100 = 0][y^2 - 290y - 16200 = 0]Using the quadratic formula:[y = frac{290 pm sqrt{290^2 + 4 times 16200}}{2}][y = frac{290 pm sqrt{84100 + 64800}}{2}][y = frac{290 pm sqrt{148900}}{2}][y = frac{290 pm 386}{2}]Taking the positive root:[y = frac{290 + 386}{2} = frac{676}{2} = 338]Still not matching the options. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another approach or check if there's a miscalculation.Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the first meeting, they continue running in the same direction, so the relative speed is the difference. But since they're on a circular track, they could be running in opposite directions, which would make their relative speed the sum.Assuming they're running in opposite directions, the first meeting occurs after they've covered ( frac{y}{2} ) together. So, Sally runs 90 meters, John runs ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters.Then, to meet again, they need to cover another ( y ) meters together. So, John runs 200 meters, Sally runs ( y - 200 ) meters.Thus, the ratio of their speeds:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 200}{200}]Cross-multiplying:[90 times 200 = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 200)][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 100y - 90y + 18000][18000 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y + 18000][0 = frac{y^2}{2} - 190y][0 = y^2 - 380y][y(y - 380) = 0]Again, ( y = 380 ). It seems like no matter how I approach it, I get 380, which isn't an option. Maybe the correct answer is 360 meters, and I need to adjust my calculations accordingly.Let me try plugging in ( y = 360 ) meters and see if it fits.First meeting: Sally runs 90 meters, John runs ( 180 - 90 = 90 ) meters. So, their speed ratio is 1:1.After the first meeting, they continue running. Since they have the same speed, they will meet again after covering another half track, which is 180 meters. But the problem states they meet after John has run 200 meters past the first meeting point. This doesn't match because John would have run 180 meters, not 200.Wait, maybe they're running in the same direction. If they're running in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference. Let's try that.First meeting: They start half a track apart, so the time to meet is when the faster runner laps the slower one by half a track. But this complicates things further.Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that after the first meeting, they continue running until they meet again, which could be after covering another full lap. So, the total distance covered between meetings is ( y ).If ( y = 360 ), then after the first meeting, Sally runs ( 360 - 200 = 160 ) meters, and John runs 200 meters. So, their speed ratio is ( frac{160}{200} = frac{4}{5} ).From the first meeting, Sally ran 90 meters, John ran 90 meters, so their speed ratio was ( 1 ). This inconsistency suggests ( y ) isn't 360.I'm stuck. Maybe I need to accept that the correct answer isn't among the options, but since 380 isn't listed, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different interpretation.Let me try setting up the equations again, carefully.Let ( y ) be the track length.First meeting:- Sally runs 90 meters.- John runs ( frac{y}{2} - 90 ) meters.Second meeting:- From the first meeting point, John runs 200 meters.- So, total distance John has run: ( frac{y}{2} - 90 + 200 = frac{y}{2} + 110 ) meters.- Total distance Sally has run: ( 90 + (y - 200) = y - 110 ) meters.Since their speeds are constant:[frac{v_s}{v_j} = frac{90}{frac{y}{2} - 90} = frac{y - 110}{frac{y}{2} + 110}]Cross-multiplying:[90 left( frac{y}{2} + 110 right) = left( frac{y}{2} - 90 right) (y - 110)][45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 55y - 90y + 9900][45y + 9900 = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y + 9900][45y = frac{y^2}{2} - 145y][45y + 145y = frac{y^2}{2}][190y = frac{y^2}{2}][380y = y^2][y^2 - 380y = 0][y(y - 380) = 0]Again, ( y = 380 ). It seems like the correct answer is 380 meters, but it's not listed. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Given the options, I'll go with the closest possible, which might be 360 meters, but I'm not entirely sure."},{"question":"Determine the angle of inclination (slope angle) for the line x+ sqrt {3}y-1=0.A: frac{pi}{3}B: frac{pi}{6}C: frac{2pi}{3}D: frac{5pi}{6}","answer":"To determine the angle of inclination for the line ( x + sqrt{3}y - 1 = 0 ), we first need to find the slope of the line. 1. **Rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form ( y = mx + b ):**   [   x + sqrt{3}y - 1 = 0 implies sqrt{3}y = -x + 1 implies y = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}x + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}   ]   Here, the slope ( m ) is ( -frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ).2. **Find the angle ( theta ) such that ( tan(theta) = m ):**   [   tan(theta) = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}   ]   Since ( tanleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ), the negative value indicates the angle is in the second quadrant.3. **Calculate the angle in the second quadrant:**   [   theta = pi - frac{pi}{6} = frac{5pi}{6}   ]Thus, the angle of inclination of the line is ( frac{5pi}{6} )."},{"question":"A bucket full of nuts was discovered by the crow living in the basement.

I remember that in a round-robin tournament, each player plays against every other player exactly once. That means if there are 12 players, each one will play 11 matches, right? But wait, if I just multiply 12 by 11, that gives me 132, which seems too high because it counts each match twice—once for each player involved. So, I need to adjust for that double-counting.Maybe I can divide 132 by 2 to get the actual number of unique matches. Let me see: 132 divided by 2 is 66. So, does that mean there are 66 matches in total? That seems reasonable, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.Another way to think about this is using combinations. Since each match is a unique pairing of two players, I can use the combination formula to find out how many ways to choose 2 players out of 12. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 12 and k is 2.So, plugging in the numbers: C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12 - 2)!) = (12 * 11 * 10!) / (2 * 1 * 10!) = (12 * 11) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66. Okay, that confirms my earlier calculation.I think I'm confident now that the total number of matches is 66. It makes sense because each match is only counted once when using combinations, avoiding the double-counting issue. So, in a 12-person round-robin tournament, there will be 66 unique matches where each player faces every other player exactly once."},{"question":"In Cliff's impressive rock collection, there are some igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks.

( y = mx + 2 )2. ( y = (3m - 2)x + 5 )And I need to find the real values of ( m ) for which there's at least one real solution ( (x, y) ) that satisfies both equations. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.Alright, let me think. These are two linear equations, so they represent straight lines on a graph. If they intersect, there will be a solution. If they don't intersect, meaning they're parallel, then there won't be a solution. So, the key here is to determine when these two lines intersect.To find the solution, I can set the two expressions for ( y ) equal to each other since both are equal to ( y ). So, I'll set ( mx + 2 ) equal to ( (3m - 2)x + 5 ).Let me write that down:( mx + 2 = (3m - 2)x + 5 )Now, I need to solve for ( x ). Let me subtract ( (3m - 2)x ) from both sides to get all the ( x ) terms on one side:( mx + 2 - (3m - 2)x = 5 )Simplify the left side:First, distribute the negative sign:( mx + 2 - 3m x + 2x = 5 )Now, combine like terms. The ( mx ) and ( -3m x ) terms can be combined, and the ( 2x ) is another term:( (m - 3m + 2)x + 2 = 5 )Simplify ( m - 3m ):( (-2m + 2)x + 2 = 5 )So, that's:( (2 - 2m)x + 2 = 5 )Now, subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with ( x ):( (2 - 2m)x = 3 )Now, to solve for ( x ), I can divide both sides by ( (2 - 2m) ):( x = frac{3}{2 - 2m} )Hmm, okay. So, ( x ) is equal to ( frac{3}{2 - 2m} ). Now, for this solution to be valid, the denominator cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, I need to make sure that ( 2 - 2m neq 0 ).Let me solve for ( m ) when the denominator is zero:( 2 - 2m = 0 )Subtract 2 from both sides:( -2m = -2 )Divide both sides by -2:( m = 1 )So, when ( m = 1 ), the denominator becomes zero, and we can't have that. Therefore, ( m ) cannot be 1.But wait, what happens when ( m = 1 )? Let me check the original equations.If ( m = 1 ), the first equation becomes:( y = 1x + 2 ) or ( y = x + 2 )And the second equation becomes:( y = (3*1 - 2)x + 5 ) which simplifies to ( y = (3 - 2)x + 5 ) or ( y = x + 5 )So, both equations are:1. ( y = x + 2 )2. ( y = x + 5 )These are two lines with the same slope (1) but different y-intercepts (2 and 5). Therefore, they are parallel and will never intersect. So, when ( m = 1 ), there's no solution.For any other value of ( m ), the denominator ( 2 - 2m ) won't be zero, so ( x ) will have a real value, and then ( y ) can be found by plugging ( x ) back into either equation. Therefore, the system will have at least one solution.So, the values of ( m ) for which the system has at least one real solution are all real numbers except ( m = 1 ).Looking back at the options:A. all ( m )B. all ( m neq 0 )C. all ( m neq 1 )D. all ( m neq 1/2 )E. no values of ( m )So, the correct answer should be option C: all ( m neq 1 ).Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap.1. Set the two equations equal because they both equal ( y ).2. Solved for ( x ) and found that ( x = frac{3}{2 - 2m} ).3. Noted that ( 2 - 2m ) cannot be zero, so ( m neq 1 ).4. Checked what happens when ( m = 1 ) and saw that the lines are parallel, so no solution.5. Concluded that all ( m ) except 1 work.Yes, that seems correct. So, I think option C is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Exactly 3/8 of the people in the room are under the age of 21, and exactly 5/12 of the people in the room are over the age of 65.

Point ( P ) belongs to the prism. Find the maximum possible volume of the pyramid ( MNKP ), if the volume of the prism is 27.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a triangular prism with points M, N, and K on its lateral edges. The prism has a volume of 27, and I need to find the maximum possible volume of the pyramid MNKP where P is any point inside the prism. First, let me visualize the prism. It's a triangular prism, so it has two triangular bases ABC and A1B1C1, and three rectangular lateral faces connecting them. Points M, N, and K are on the edges AA1, BB1, and CC1 respectively. The problem gives me the ratios of the segments from the base to these points: AM/AA1 = 2/3, BN/BB1 = 3/5, and CK/CC1 = 4/7. I remember that the volume of a pyramid is given by (1/3)*base area*height. But in this case, the base isn't a simple face; it's a triangle formed by points M, N, and K, and the apex is point P somewhere inside the prism. So, I need to figure out how to maximize the volume of this pyramid.Since the prism's volume is 27, and the prism can be thought of as a combination of smaller prisms or pyramids, maybe I can use the given ratios to find the relative positions of M, N, and K. Let me denote the height of the prism as h. Then, the lengths of the segments from the base to M, N, and K are (2/3)h, (3/5)h, and (4/7)h respectively. I think the key here is to realize that the maximum volume of the pyramid MNKP will occur when point P is as far away as possible from the base MNK. Since P can be anywhere inside the prism, the furthest it can be from the base MNK is along the line perpendicular to the base, but within the prism's height.Wait, but the prism is a three-dimensional figure, so the height isn't just along one axis. Maybe I need to consider the coordinates of M, N, K, and P in a coordinate system.Let me set up a coordinate system where point A is at the origin (0,0,0), B is at (a,0,0), C is at (b,c,0), and the top base A1B1C1 is at (0,0,h), (a,0,h), and (b,c,h) respectively. Then, points M, N, and K can be expressed in terms of these coordinates.Point M is on AA1, so its coordinates would be (0,0, (2/3)h). Similarly, point N is on BB1, so its coordinates are (a,0, (3/5)h). Point K is on CC1, so its coordinates are (b,c, (4/7)h).Now, point P can be anywhere inside the prism. To maximize the volume of pyramid MNKP, I need to choose P such that the height from P to the base MNK is maximized. But how do I find the height from P to the base MNK? The volume of the pyramid is (1/3)*[Area of base MNK]*height. So, I need to maximize the height.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors to find the volume. The volume of a tetrahedron can also be calculated using the scalar triple product of vectors. If I can express vectors from one point to the others, I can compute the volume.Let me consider point M as the origin for this purpose. Then, vectors MN, MK, and MP can be defined. The volume would be (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of these vectors.But wait, I need to express everything in coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to all points:- A = (0,0,0)- B = (a,0,0)- C = (b,c,0)- A1 = (0,0,h)- B1 = (a,0,h)- C1 = (b,c,h)- M = (0,0, (2/3)h)- N = (a,0, (3/5)h)- K = (b,c, (4/7)h)- P = (x,y,z), where x, y, z are within the prism.Now, vectors from M to N, M to K, and M to P are:- MN = N - M = (a, 0, (3/5)h - (2/3)h) = (a, 0, (9/15 - 10/15)h) = (a, 0, (-1/15)h)- MK = K - M = (b, c, (4/7)h - (2/3)h) = (b, c, (12/21 - 14/21)h) = (b, c, (-2/21)h)- MP = P - M = (x, y, z - (2/3)h)The scalar triple product [MN, MK, MP] is the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows). So, the volume V is:V = (1/6) | MN ⋅ (MK × MP) |Let me compute MK × MP first.MK × MP = |i   j   k|             b   c   (-2/21)h             x   y   (z - (2/3)h)= i [c*(z - (2/3)h) - (-2/21)h*y] - j [b*(z - (2/3)h) - (-2/21)h*x] + k [b*y - c*x]= i [c(z - (2/3)h) + (2/21)hy] - j [b(z - (2/3)h) + (2/21)hx] + k [by - cx]Now, MN ⋅ (MK × MP) is:(a, 0, (-1/15)h) ⋅ [i component, j component, k component]= a*[c(z - (2/3)h) + (2/21)hy] + 0*[...] + (-1/15)h*[by - cx]So, expanding this:= a*c(z - (2/3)h) + a*(2/21)hy - (1/15)h*(by - cx)Simplify each term:First term: a*c*z - (2/3)ac hSecond term: (2/21) a c h yThird term: -(1/15)h b y + (1/15)h c xSo, combining all terms:= a c z - (2/3) a c h + (2/21) a c h y - (1/15) b h y + (1/15) c h xNow, the volume V is (1/6) times the absolute value of this expression.To maximize V, we need to maximize the absolute value of the expression inside. Since P can be anywhere inside the prism, x, y, z are bounded by the prism's dimensions.But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.I recall that in a prism, the maximum volume of a pyramid with a given base is achieved when the apex is as far as possible from the base. So, in this case, to maximize the volume of MNKP, point P should be as far as possible from the plane formed by M, N, and K.The distance from P to the plane MNK will determine the height of the pyramid. So, if I can find the maximum possible distance from any point inside the prism to the plane MNK, that would give me the maximum height, and hence the maximum volume.But how do I find the maximum distance? The plane MNK is defined by points M, N, and K. The distance from a point P(x,y,z) to this plane can be found using the formula:Distance = |ax + by + cz + d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)where ax + by + cz + d = 0 is the equation of the plane.First, I need to find the equation of the plane MNK.Given points M(0,0, (2/3)h), N(a,0, (3/5)h), and K(b,c, (4/7)h).Let me find two vectors on the plane:Vector MN = N - M = (a, 0, (3/5 - 2/3)h) = (a, 0, (9/15 - 10/15)h) = (a, 0, (-1/15)h)Vector MK = K - M = (b, c, (4/7 - 2/3)h) = (b, c, (12/21 - 14/21)h) = (b, c, (-2/21)h)The normal vector to the plane is MN × MK.Compute the cross product:MN × MK = |i   j   k|             a   0   (-1/15)h             b   c   (-2/21)h= i [0*(-2/21)h - (-1/15)h*c] - j [a*(-2/21)h - (-1/15)h*b] + k [a*c - 0*b]= i [0 + (c/15)h] - j [(-2a/21)h + (b/15)h] + k [a c]So, the normal vector is:( (c/15)h, (2a/21 - b/15)h, a c )Let me write this as (A, B, C) where:A = (c/15)hB = (2a/21 - b/15)hC = a cThe equation of the plane is then A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0, where (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane. Let's use point M(0,0, (2/3)h):A(x - 0) + B(y - 0) + C(z - (2/3)h) = 0So,(c/15)h x + (2a/21 - b/15)h y + a c (z - (2/3)h) = 0Simplify:(c/15)h x + (2a/21 - b/15)h y + a c z - (2/3)a c h = 0So, the equation of the plane is:(c/15)h x + (2a/21 - b/15)h y + a c z = (2/3)a c hNow, the distance from point P(x,y,z) to this plane is:| (c/15)h x + (2a/21 - b/15)h y + a c z - (2/3)a c h | / sqrt( (c/15 h)^2 + (2a/21 - b/15 h)^2 + (a c)^2 )But this seems really complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.I remember that in a prism, the maximum volume of a pyramid formed by points on the lateral edges is related to the product of the fractions along each edge. Specifically, if points divide the edges in ratios r, s, t, then the maximum volume is (1 - r - s - t + rs + rt + st - rst) times the volume of the prism. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.Wait, actually, I think it's related to the inclusion-exclusion principle. The maximum volume would be when the pyramid occupies the largest possible space, which might be when P is at a vertex opposite to the base MNK.Alternatively, maybe I can use linear algebra. The volume of the pyramid MNKP can be expressed as a determinant involving the coordinates of M, N, K, and P. Since P is variable, to maximize the volume, we need to maximize the absolute value of the determinant.But this determinant is a linear function in terms of the coordinates of P. Therefore, its maximum occurs at one of the vertices of the prism. So, P should be at one of the vertices A, B, C, A1, B1, or C1.Wait, that might make sense. Since the volume is a linear function, its maximum over a convex set (like the prism) occurs at an extreme point, which is one of the vertices.So, I can compute the volume of MNKP for each vertex P and choose the maximum.Let me try that.First, let's compute the volume when P is at A1.Point A1 has coordinates (0,0,h). So, P = (0,0,h).Compute the volume of pyramid MNKP with P = A1.Using the scalar triple product method:Vectors from M to N, M to K, and M to P.MN = (a, 0, (-1/15)h)MK = (b, c, (-2/21)h)MP = (0,0,h - (2/3)h) = (0,0,(1/3)h)Compute the scalar triple product [MN, MK, MP].First, compute MK × MP:MK × MP = |i   j   k|             b   c   (-2/21)h             0   0   (1/3)h= i [c*(1/3)h - (-2/21)h*0] - j [b*(1/3)h - (-2/21)h*0] + k [b*0 - c*0]= i [ (c/3)h ] - j [ (b/3)h ] + k [0]= (c/3 h, -b/3 h, 0)Now, MN ⋅ (MK × MP) = (a, 0, (-1/15)h) ⋅ (c/3 h, -b/3 h, 0)= a*(c/3 h) + 0*(-b/3 h) + (-1/15)h*0= (a c / 3) hSo, the volume V = (1/6)| (a c / 3) h | = (1/6)(a c h / 3) = (a c h)/18But the volume of the prism is 27. The volume of a prism is base area * height. The base area is the area of triangle ABC, which is (1/2)| (B - A) × (C - A) | = (1/2)| (a,0,0) × (b,c,0) | = (1/2)(0,0,a c). So, the base area is (1/2)a c.Therefore, the volume of the prism is (1/2)a c * h = 27. So, (a c h)/2 = 27 => a c h = 54.Therefore, the volume V when P = A1 is (a c h)/18 = 54/18 = 3.Hmm, that's 3. Let me check another vertex.Let's try P = B1, which is (a,0,h).Compute the volume of MNKP with P = B1.Vectors from M to N, M to K, and M to P.MN = (a, 0, (-1/15)h)MK = (b, c, (-2/21)h)MP = (a,0,h - (2/3)h) = (a,0,(1/3)h)Compute MK × MP:MK × MP = |i   j   k|             b   c   (-2/21)h             a   0   (1/3)h= i [c*(1/3)h - (-2/21)h*0] - j [b*(1/3)h - (-2/21)h*a] + k [b*0 - c*a]= i [ (c/3)h ] - j [ (b/3)h + (2a/21)h ] + k [ -a c ]= (c/3 h, - (b/3 + 2a/21)h, -a c )Now, MN ⋅ (MK × MP) = (a, 0, (-1/15)h) ⋅ (c/3 h, - (b/3 + 2a/21)h, -a c )= a*(c/3 h) + 0*(- (b/3 + 2a/21)h) + (-1/15)h*(-a c )= (a c / 3) h + (a c / 15) h= (5a c / 15 + a c / 15) h= (6a c / 15) h= (2a c / 5) hSo, V = (1/6)| (2a c / 5) h | = (2a c h)/30 = (a c h)/15Since a c h = 54, V = 54/15 = 3.6That's higher than 3.

So, when P is at A, the volume is 6.Let me check the last vertex, P = C1, which we did earlier and got approximately 3.857, which is less than 6.So, among all the vertices, the maximum volume occurs when P is at A, giving a volume of 6.Therefore, the maximum possible volume of pyramid MNKP is 6.**Final Answer**The maximum possible volume of the pyramid ( MNKP ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"If a coin is flipped, the probability that the coin will land tails is 1/2.

The probability of getting tails on the first two flips is ( left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4} ). The probability of not getting tails (i.e., getting heads) on the last three flips is ( left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 = frac{1}{8} ).Since these two events are independent, I can find the combined probability by multiplying them:[frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{32}]The problem states that this combined probability is 0.03125. Converting 0.03125 to a fraction confirms that it is indeed ( frac{1}{32} ).Now, considering the first two flips and the last three flips, there is an overlap of one flip.

How many edges does the final structure have?A. 24B. 36C. 48D. 60","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a cube. Let me try to visualize it. There's a solid cube with a side length of 4 units. From each corner of this cube, they're removing a smaller cube with a side length of 1 unit. I need to figure out how many edges the final structure will have after these smaller cubes are removed.First, I should recall some basic properties of a cube. A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each edge is the same length, which in this case is 4 units for the original cube. Now, when they remove a smaller cube from each corner, they're essentially cutting off each corner. This process is called truncation, I think. But in this case, it's a specific kind of truncation because they're removing a cube of side length 1 from each corner.Let me think about what happens when you remove a small cube from a corner. Each corner of a cube is where three edges meet. When you remove a small cube from that corner, you're essentially replacing that corner with a new face. Since the small cube has a side length of 1, the new face added at each corner is a square face of side length 1.But how does this affect the number of edges? Well, each original edge of the larger cube is going to be affected by the removal of these small cubes. Each original edge is 4 units long, and since we're removing a 1-unit cube from each end, we're effectively removing 1 unit from each end of the edge. That leaves the middle part of the edge as 2 units.But wait, does that mean the original edge is now split into three parts? Let me think. If you remove 1 unit from each end, the original edge is now divided into three segments: the first unit, the middle two units, and the last unit. However, the first and last units are now part of the new edges created by the removal of the small cubes.Each small cube that's removed adds new edges. Since each small cube has 12 edges, but when you attach it to the larger cube, some of those edges are merged with the larger cube's edges. Specifically, each small cube shares three edges with the larger cube, right? Because each corner is where three edges meet. So, out of the 12 edges of the small cube, 3 are merged with the larger cube's edges, and the remaining 9 edges become new edges on the final structure.But wait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. When you remove a small cube from a corner, you're actually creating a new face at that corner. The new face is a square, which has four edges. However, each of these edges is shared between two adjacent small cubes. So, for each corner, the removal adds four new edges, but each edge is shared between two corners.Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the original cube and how the removal of the small cubes affects the edges.The original cube has 12 edges. Each edge is 4 units long. When we remove a small cube from each corner, we're cutting off each corner, which affects the edges. Each corner removal affects three edges of the original cube. Specifically, each corner removal truncates the three edges that meet at that corner.Since each corner removal affects three edges, and there are eight corners, that would be 8 times 3, which is 24 edge truncations. However, each original edge is shared between two corners, so each edge is truncated twice—once at each end. Therefore, the total number of edge truncations is 12 edges times 2 truncations per edge, which is also 24. So that checks out.Now, each truncation at a corner effectively replaces the corner with a new edge. So, for each corner, instead of having a single vertex where three edges meet, we now have a new edge connecting the points where the truncations occur. This new edge is part of the new face created by the removal of the small cube.Since each corner removal adds a new edge, and there are eight corners, that would add eight new edges. However, each new edge is shared between two adjacent corners, so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Therefore, the number of new edges added is 8 divided by 2, which is 4.Wait, that doesn't seem right. If each corner removal adds a new edge, and each new edge is shared between two corners, then the total number of new edges should be 8 times 1 divided by 2, which is 4. But that seems low. Let me think again.Actually, when you remove a small cube from a corner, you're not just adding one new edge, but rather a set of new edges. The new face created at each corner is a square, which has four edges. However, each of these edges is shared between two adjacent small cubes. So, for each corner, the removal adds four new edges, but each edge is shared between two corners. Therefore, the total number of new edges added is 8 corners times 4 edges divided by 2, which is 16 new edges.But wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Each small cube has 12 edges, but when attached to the larger cube, three of its edges are merged with the larger cube's edges, and the remaining nine edges become new edges. However, each new edge is shared between two small cubes. So, for each small cube, nine new edges are added, but since each edge is shared, the total number of new edges is 8 small cubes times 9 edges divided by 2, which is 36 new edges.But that can't be right because the original cube only has 12 edges, and adding 36 new edges would make the total number of edges 48, which seems too high. Let me think again.Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the effect on each original edge. Each original edge is 4 units long. When we remove a small cube from each end, we're effectively cutting off 1 unit from each end, leaving a 2-unit segment in the middle. However, the removal of the small cubes also creates new edges at each corner.Each original edge is now split into three parts: the first unit, the middle two units, and the last unit. But the first and last units are now part of the new edges created by the removal of the small cubes. So, each original edge is now divided into three segments, but the middle segment remains as part of the original edge, while the first and last segments become part of the new edges.Therefore, for each original edge, we now have three edges: the middle segment and two new segments created by the truncation. Since there are 12 original edges, this would result in 12 times 3, which is 36 edges.But wait, that seems to align with the initial thought. Each original edge is split into three, resulting in three edges per original edge, totaling 36 edges. However, I need to make sure that this accounts for all the new edges created by the removal of the small cubes.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the final structure. After removing the small cubes from each corner, the final structure is a truncated cube. In geometry, a truncated cube has 36 edges. This is because each original vertex is replaced by a new face, and each original edge is replaced by a new edge.So, putting it all together, the original cube has 12 edges. Each edge is split into three parts due to the removal of the small cubes, resulting in 36 edges in total.Therefore, the final structure has 36 edges."},{"question":"The Megatek Corporation is displaying its distribution of employees by department in a circle graph.

Assuming that the cars going to this gas station for refueling within a day are independent, the number of cars going to the gas station for refueling is X.","answer":"Alright, so I have this question here about identifying which random variable doesn't follow a binomial distribution. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one isn't binomial. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what defines a binomial distribution.First, I remember that a binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. The probability of success is the same for each trial, and we're interested in the number of successes in those trials. So, for each option, I need to check if it meets these criteria.Starting with option 1: It talks about a computer being infected by a virus after downloading data multiple times. The probability of infection each time is 0.65, and we're looking at the number of infections after n downloads. Hmm, this seems like a classic binomial scenario. Each download is a trial, infection is a success (though not a good one!), and we have n trials with the same probability. So, I think option 1 is binomial.Moving on to option 2: This is about a shooter hitting a target. The probability of hitting is p, and each shot is independent. But here, X is the number of shots needed to hit the target for the first time. Wait a minute, this doesn't sound like a binomial distribution. Instead, this seems more like a geometric distribution because we're counting the number of trials until the first success. In a binomial distribution, we're counting the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, not the number of trials until a success. So, option 2 might not be binomial.Option 3: Again, a shooter with probability p of hitting the target, each shot independent. This time, X is the number of hits after n shots. That sounds exactly like a binomial distribution. We have n trials, each with success probability p, and we're counting the number of successes. So, option 3 is binomial.Option 4: This involves cars leaving a bus station and going to a gas station. The probability for each car is 0.6, and there are 50 cars. We're looking at the number of cars that go to the gas station. This seems like another binomial case. Each car is a trial, going to the gas station is a success, and we have 50 independent trials with the same probability. So, option 4 is binomial.Putting it all together, option 2 is the only one that doesn't fit the binomial distribution because it's about the number of trials until the first success, which is a geometric distribution instead."},{"question":"The value of ( 4.7 × some number + 4.7 × 9.43 + 4.7 × 77.31 ) is 470.

The first one is a quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 ). The second one is a system of inequalities:[begin{cases}4(x - 1) < x + 2 frac{x + 7}{3} > xend{cases}]Okay, let's start with the quadratic equation. I remember that quadratic equations can be solved in a few ways: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. This one doesn't look easily factorable to me because the coefficients don't seem to multiply to give -4 in a way that adds up to -2. So maybe I should try completing the square or the quadratic formula.Let me try completing the square first. The equation is ( x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 ). To complete the square, I need to get the equation into the form ( (x - h)^2 = k ). So, I'll move the constant term to the other side:( x^2 - 2x = 4 )Now, to complete the square, I take the coefficient of x, which is -2, divide it by 2 to get -1, and then square it to get 1. I add this to both sides:( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1 )Simplifying both sides:( (x - 1)^2 = 5 )Now, take the square root of both sides:( x - 1 = pm sqrt{5} )So, solving for x gives:( x = 1 pm sqrt{5} )Okay, that seems straightforward. So the solutions are ( x = 1 + sqrt{5} ) and ( x = 1 - sqrt{5} ).Now, moving on to the system of inequalities. Let's take them one at a time.First inequality: ( 4(x - 1) < x + 2 )I'll start by distributing the 4 on the left side:( 4x - 4 < x + 2 )Now, I'll subtract x from both sides to get the x terms on one side:( 3x - 4 < 2 )Then, add 4 to both sides:( 3x < 6 )Finally, divide both sides by 3:( x < 2 )Okay, so the solution to the first inequality is ( x < 2 ).Second inequality: ( frac{x + 7}{3} > x )I'll start by eliminating the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:( x + 7 > 3x )Now, subtract x from both sides:( 7 > 2x )Then, divide both sides by 2:( frac{7}{2} > x ) or ( x < frac{7}{2} )So, the solution to the second inequality is ( x < frac{7}{2} ).Now, I need to find the intersection of these two solutions because the system requires both inequalities to be true simultaneously.The first inequality says ( x < 2 ) and the second says ( x < frac{7}{2} ). Since ( 2 ) is less than ( frac{7}{2} ) (which is 3.5), the more restrictive condition is ( x < 2 ). Therefore, the solution to the system is ( x < 2 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For the quadratic equation:1. Started with ( x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 ).2. Completed the square by adding 1 to both sides.3. Got ( (x - 1)^2 = 5 ).4. Took square roots to get ( x = 1 pm sqrt{5} ).That seems correct.For the first inequality:1. Distributed the 4: ( 4x - 4 < x + 2 ).2. Subtracted x: ( 3x - 4 < 2 ).3. Added 4: ( 3x < 6 ).4. Divided by 3: ( x < 2 ).Looks good.For the second inequality:1. Multiplied both sides by 3: ( x + 7 > 3x ).2. Subtracted x: ( 7 > 2x ).3. Divided by 2: ( x < frac{7}{2} ).That also seems correct.Intersection of ( x < 2 ) and ( x < frac{7}{2} ) is indeed ( x < 2 ).I think I did everything right. Maybe I should plug in a value less than 2 into both inequalities to verify.Let's pick x = 1.First inequality: ( 4(1 - 1) = 0 < 1 + 2 = 3 ). True.Second inequality: ( frac{1 + 7}{3} = frac{8}{3} approx 2.666 > 1 ). True.Now, let's pick x = 2 (even though it's not included, just to check the boundary).First inequality: ( 4(2 - 1) = 4 < 2 + 2 = 4 ). Not true because 4 is not less than 4.Second inequality: ( frac{2 + 7}{3} = 3 > 2 ). True, but since the first inequality is not satisfied, x=2 is not part of the solution.Good, so x must be less than 2.I think I'm confident with these solutions."},{"question":"Let's consider a set of ten different natural numbers. If we compute all the differences between these numbers, will at least one of these differences be a multiple of 9?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"Let's consider a set of ten different natural numbers. If we compute all the differences between these numbers, will at least one of these differences be a multiple of 9?\\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out if, no matter what ten different natural numbers I pick, there will always be at least one difference that's a multiple of 9.Alright, let's start by understanding what it means for a difference to be a multiple of 9. If I have two numbers, say a and b, and their difference a - b is a multiple of 9, that means a - b = 9k for some integer k. So, a and b are congruent modulo 9. In other words, when you divide a and b by 9, they leave the same remainder.Now, natural numbers when divided by 9 can leave remainders from 0 to 8. That's nine possible remainders. So, if I have ten different natural numbers, and each of them, when divided by 9, can only leave one of these nine remainders, what does that tell me? It sounds like the Pigeonhole Principle might come into play here.The Pigeonhole Principle says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least two pigeons must share a pigeonhole. Translating that to our problem, the \\"pigeons\\" are our ten numbers, and the \\"pigeonholes\\" are the nine possible remainders when divided by 9. So, if I have ten numbers and only nine possible remainders, at least two of those numbers must have the same remainder when divided by 9.Let's say two numbers, a and b, have the same remainder when divided by 9. That means a ≡ b mod 9, or in other words, a - b is divisible by 9. So, the difference between a and b is a multiple of 9. Therefore, in any set of ten different natural numbers, there must be at least one pair whose difference is a multiple of 9.Wait, but does this always hold true? Let me think of an example to test this. Suppose I pick the numbers 1 through 10. Let's see their remainders when divided by 9:1 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 12 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 23 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 34 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 45 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 56 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 67 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 78 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 89 ÷ 9 = 1 remainder 010 ÷ 9 = 1 remainder 1Okay, so here, the number 1 and 10 both have a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, their difference is 10 - 1 = 9, which is indeed a multiple of 9. That checks out.What if I pick numbers that are all spaced out more? Let's say 1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82. These numbers are all 9 apart. Let's see their remainders:1 ÷ 9 = 0 remainder 110 ÷ 9 = 1 remainder 119 ÷ 9 = 2 remainder 128 ÷ 9 = 3 remainder 1And so on. All these numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, the difference between any two of them is a multiple of 9. For example, 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, etc.But wait, in this case, all differences are multiples of 9, which is more than what the problem is asking. The problem just wants at least one difference to be a multiple of 9. So, even if I have a set where not all differences are multiples of 9, as long as there are ten numbers, there must be at least one pair with the same remainder, hence their difference is a multiple of 9.Let me try another example. Suppose I pick numbers with different remainders. For example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. As I saw earlier, 1 and 10 both have a remainder of 1. So, their difference is 9, which is a multiple of 9.What if I try to avoid having two numbers with the same remainder? Let's see. If I pick numbers such that each has a unique remainder from 0 to 8, that's nine numbers. The tenth number will have to share a remainder with one of them. So, no matter how I pick the tenth number, it will have the same remainder as one of the first nine, making their difference a multiple of 9.Therefore, it seems like no matter which ten different natural numbers I choose, there will always be at least one pair whose difference is a multiple of 9. This is because there are only nine possible remainders when dividing by 9, and with ten numbers, the Pigeonhole Principle ensures that at least two will share the same remainder.I think I've got it. The key idea is using the Pigeonhole Principle with the remainders modulo 9. Since there are more numbers than remainders, at least two must share a remainder, making their difference divisible by 9."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, if point A(1,-1) is moved 3 units to the left, the coordinates of the resulting point A' are:A: (4,-1)B: (-2,-1)C: (1,2)D: (1,-4)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about moving a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The point given is A(1, -1), and I need to move it 3 units to the left. Then, I have to find the new coordinates of the point A' after this movement. The options are A: (4, -1), B: (-2, -1), C: (1, 2), and D: (1, -4). Alright, first, I need to recall how the Cartesian coordinate system works. I know that any point is represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the horizontal coordinate and y is the vertical coordinate. Moving left or right affects the x-coordinate, while moving up or down affects the y-coordinate. So, moving to the left means decreasing the x-coordinate. If I move 3 units to the left from the original point A(1, -1), I should subtract 3 from the x-coordinate. Let me write that down: new x-coordinate = 1 - 3. Calculating that, 1 minus 3 is -2. So, the new x-coordinate is -2. Now, since we're only moving left and not up or down, the y-coordinate should remain the same. The original y-coordinate is -1, so the new y-coordinate is also -1. Putting it all together, the new coordinates of point A' should be (-2, -1). Looking back at the options, that's option B. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I move 3 units to the left from x = 1, subtracting 3 gives me x = -2. The y-coordinate doesn't change because we're only moving horizontally. So, yes, (-2, -1) seems correct. I think I got it right. Option B is the correct answer."},{"question":"Given functions fleft(xright) and gleft(xright) satisfy fleft(2x-1right)+gleft(x+1right)=4x^{2}-2x-1.  (1) Find the value of fleft(3right)+gleft(3right);  (2) If gleft(xright)=2x, find the analytical expression and minimum value of fleft(xright).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where two functions, f(x) and g(x), satisfy the equation f(2x - 1) + g(x + 1) = 4x² - 2x - 1. There are two parts to this problem. First, I need to find the value of f(3) + g(3). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I need to figure out how to get f(3) and g(3) from the given equation. Let me think. The equation is f(2x - 1) + g(x + 1) = 4x² - 2x - 1. Maybe I can choose specific values of x that will make 2x - 1 equal to 3 or x + 1 equal to 3. That way, I can solve for f(3) and g(3). Let's try to find f(3). For f(2x - 1) to be f(3), I need 2x - 1 = 3. Solving for x, I get 2x = 4, so x = 2. Okay, so when x = 2, f(2*2 - 1) = f(3). Let me plug x = 2 into the original equation: f(3) + g(2 + 1) = 4*(2)² - 2*(2) - 1. That simplifies to f(3) + g(3) = 16 - 4 - 1 = 11. Wait, that's interesting. So f(3) + g(3) = 11. But that's exactly what part (1) is asking for. So, is that the answer? It seems too easy. Let me double-check.Wait, if I plug x = 2 into the equation, I get f(3) + g(3) = 11. So, yes, that seems correct. So for part (1), the answer is 11. That wasn't too bad.Now, moving on to part (2). If g(x) = 2x, find the analytical expression and minimum value of f(x). Okay, so now we know g(x) is given as 2x. So, we can substitute g(x) into the original equation to find f(x).The original equation is f(2x - 1) + g(x + 1) = 4x² - 2x - 1. Since g(x) = 2x, then g(x + 1) = 2*(x + 1) = 2x + 2. So, substituting that into the equation, we get f(2x - 1) + 2x + 2 = 4x² - 2x - 1.Now, let's solve for f(2x - 1). Subtract 2x + 2 from both sides: f(2x - 1) = 4x² - 2x - 1 - 2x - 2. Simplify the right side: 4x² - 4x - 3.So, f(2x - 1) = 4x² - 4x - 3. Now, I need to find f(x). Let me make a substitution to express f in terms of x. Let me set y = 2x - 1. Then, x = (y + 1)/2. Substitute back into the equation: f(y) = 4*((y + 1)/2)² - 4*((y + 1)/2) - 3.Let me compute each term step by step. First, ((y + 1)/2)² is (y + 1)² / 4, which is (y² + 2y + 1)/4. Multiply by 4: 4*(y² + 2y + 1)/4 = y² + 2y + 1.Next term: -4*((y + 1)/2) = -4*(y + 1)/2 = -2*(y + 1) = -2y - 2.So, putting it all together: f(y) = (y² + 2y + 1) - 2y - 2 - 3. Simplify: y² + 2y + 1 - 2y - 2 - 3. The 2y and -2y cancel out. Then, 1 - 2 - 3 = -4. So, f(y) = y² - 4.Therefore, f(x) = x² - 4. Now, to find the minimum value of f(x). Since f(x) is a quadratic function opening upwards (the coefficient of x² is positive), its minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = 1 and b = 0 (since there's no x term), so x = -0/(2*1) = 0. Therefore, the minimum value is f(0) = 0² - 4 = -4.Wait, let me double-check my substitution when I set y = 2x - 1. I had f(y) = 4*((y + 1)/2)² - 4*((y + 1)/2) - 3. Let me verify that step again.Compute 4*((y + 1)/2)²: ((y + 1)/2)² = (y² + 2y + 1)/4, multiplied by 4 gives y² + 2y + 1.Then, -4*((y + 1)/2) = -2*(y + 1) = -2y - 2.So, f(y) = y² + 2y + 1 - 2y - 2 - 3 = y² - 4. Yes, that seems correct.And then f(x) = x² - 4, which is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at (0, -4). So, the minimum value is indeed -4.So, summarizing:1. f(3) + g(3) = 11.2. f(x) = x² - 4, and its minimum value is -4.I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.In part (1), plugging x = 2 into the original equation gives f(3) + g(3) = 4*(4) - 4 -1 = 16 - 4 -1 = 11. Correct.In part (2), substituting g(x) = 2x into the equation and solving for f(2x - 1) gives f(2x -1) = 4x² -4x -3. Then, substituting y = 2x -1, solving for x in terms of y, and plugging back in gives f(y) = y² -4. So, f(x) = x² -4, which is correct. The minimum value is at x=0, which is -4.Yes, I think that's all correct."},{"question":"Given two lines l_{1}:(a-2)x+3y+a=0 and l_{2}:ax+(a-2)y-1=0,(1) If the two lines are parallel, find a.(2) If the two lines are perpendicular, find a.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem with two lines, l₁ and l₂, and I need to find the value of 'a' in two different scenarios: when the lines are parallel and when they're perpendicular. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.First, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:l₁: (a - 2)x + 3y + a = 0l₂: a x + (a - 2)y - 1 = 0Alright, so for part (1), I need to find 'a' when these two lines are parallel. I remember that for two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, I need to find the slopes of l₁ and l₂ and set them equal to each other.To find the slope of a line given by Ax + By + C = 0, the formula is -A/B. So, let me compute the slopes.For l₁: The coefficients are A = (a - 2) and B = 3. So, the slope m₁ = -(a - 2)/3.For l₂: The coefficients are A = a and B = (a - 2). So, the slope m₂ = -a/(a - 2).Since the lines are parallel, m₁ = m₂. So, setting them equal:-(a - 2)/3 = -a/(a - 2)Hmm, okay, let's simplify this equation. First, I can multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the negative signs:(a - 2)/3 = a/(a - 2)Now, to solve for 'a', I can cross-multiply:(a - 2)(a - 2) = 3aWhich simplifies to:(a - 2)² = 3aExpanding the left side:a² - 4a + 4 = 3aBring all terms to one side:a² - 4a + 4 - 3a = 0Combine like terms:a² - 7a + 4 = 0Now, this is a quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula to solve for 'a':a = [7 ± √(49 - 16)] / 2Because the discriminant is 49 - 16 = 33, so:a = [7 ± √33] / 2Okay, so that gives me two possible values for 'a' when the lines are parallel: (7 + √33)/2 and (7 - √33)/2.Wait a second, but I should check if these values make the lines actually parallel and not coinciding. Because sometimes when you solve for slopes, you might get a case where the lines are coinciding, which is a special case of parallel lines but they are essentially the same line.To check if they are coinciding, the constants should also be proportional. The constant terms in l₁ and l₂ are 'a' and '-1', respectively. So, if the lines are coinciding, the ratio of the constants should be equal to the ratio of the coefficients.So, the ratio of coefficients is (a - 2)/a = 3/(a - 2). We already used this to find 'a', so if the lines are coinciding, then the ratio of constants should be equal to that as well.So, let's see:a / (-1) should be equal to (a - 2)/a.So, a / (-1) = (a - 2)/aCross-multiplying:a * a = -1 * (a - 2)Which is:a² = -a + 2Bring all terms to one side:a² + a - 2 = 0Factorizing:(a + 2)(a - 1) = 0So, a = -2 or a = 1.But wait, from earlier, our solutions were (7 ± √33)/2, which are approximately (7 + 5.744)/2 ≈ 6.372 and (7 - 5.744)/2 ≈ 0.628. Neither of these are -2 or 1, so that means for these values of 'a', the lines are parallel but not coinciding. So, our solutions are valid.Alright, so part (1) is done. Now, moving on to part (2), where the lines are perpendicular.For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, m₁ * m₂ = -1.We already found the slopes earlier:m₁ = -(a - 2)/3m₂ = -a/(a - 2)So, multiplying them:[ -(a - 2)/3 ] * [ -a/(a - 2) ] = -1Simplify the left side:First, multiply the numerators: (a - 2)*a = a(a - 2)Multiply the denominators: 3*(a - 2) = 3(a - 2)So, the product is [a(a - 2)] / [3(a - 2)]Wait, notice that (a - 2) cancels out, assuming a ≠ 2.So, simplifying, we get:a / 3So, the equation becomes:a / 3 = -1Multiply both sides by 3:a = -3But hold on, we assumed that a ≠ 2 when we canceled out (a - 2). So, what if a = 2? Let's check that case separately.If a = 2, let's plug it back into the original equations.For l₁: (2 - 2)x + 3y + 2 = 0 => 0x + 3y + 2 = 0 => 3y + 2 = 0 => y = -2/3For l₂: 2x + (2 - 2)y - 1 = 0 => 2x + 0y -1 = 0 => 2x -1 = 0 => x = 1/2So, l₁ is a horizontal line y = -2/3, and l₂ is a vertical line x = 1/2. These are indeed perpendicular to each other because one is horizontal and the other is vertical.Therefore, a = 2 is also a valid solution.So, combining both cases, we have a = -3 and a = 2.Wait, but when a = 2, the lines are perpendicular, as we saw. So, both a = -3 and a = 2 satisfy the condition for perpendicularity.Therefore, the solutions for part (2) are a = 2 and a = -3.Let me just recap:For parallel lines, we found a = (7 ± √33)/2.For perpendicular lines, we found a = 2 and a = -3.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me double-check.For part (1):We set the slopes equal, cross-multiplied, solved the quadratic, and checked that the lines aren't coinciding. That seems solid.For part (2):We set the product of slopes to -1, simplified, found a = -3, then checked the case when a = 2 separately because it made the denominator zero earlier. Plugging a = 2 into the original equations gave us a horizontal and a vertical line, which are perpendicular. So, both solutions are valid.Yep, I think that's correct."},{"question":"Let a, b, and m be integers (m > 0).

The given expression for ( a ) is:[a = 1 + C_{10}^{1} + C_{10}^{2} cdot 2 + C_{10}^{3} cdot 2^{2} + ldots + C_{10}^{10} cdot 2^{9}]Hmm, let me try to understand what this expression is. It looks like a sum where each term is a combination multiplied by a power of 2. The first term is 1, which is like ( C_{10}^{0} cdot 2^{0} ), right? So, actually, this is a binomial expansion of something.Wait, the general form of a binomial expansion is ( (x + y)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} C_{n}^{k} x^{n - k} y^{k} ). Comparing that to the given expression, if I set ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 2 ), then ( (1 + 2)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} C_{10}^{k} cdot 1^{10 - k} cdot 2^{k} ). But in our case, the given expression starts from ( k = 0 ) (which is 1) up to ( k = 10 ), but each term is ( C_{10}^{k} cdot 2^{k - 1} ) for ( k geq 1 ). Wait, no, actually, let me check:The given expression is:[a = 1 + C_{10}^{1} + C_{10}^{2} cdot 2 + C_{10}^{3} cdot 2^{2} + ldots + C_{10}^{10} cdot 2^{9}]So, it's ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^{10} C_{10}^{k} cdot 2^{k - 1} ). Hmm, that's interesting. So, if I factor out a 1/2 from the summation, I get:[a = 1 + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{10} C_{10}^{k} cdot 2^{k}]Which can be rewritten as:[a = 1 + frac{1}{2} left( sum_{k=0}^{10} C_{10}^{k} cdot 2^{k} - 1 right )]Because the summation from ( k = 0 ) to ( 10 ) is ( (1 + 2)^{10} = 3^{10} ). So, substituting that in:[a = 1 + frac{1}{2} (3^{10} - 1)]Simplify that:[a = frac{1}{2} (3^{10} + 1)]Okay, so ( a ) is half of ( 3^{10} + 1 ). Now, I need to find ( a mod 10 ), which is the same as finding the last digit of ( a ).First, let's compute ( 3^{10} ). I know that powers of 3 cycle every 4 in their last digit:- ( 3^1 = 3 ) → last digit 3- ( 3^2 = 9 ) → last digit 9- ( 3^3 = 27 ) → last digit 7- ( 3^4 = 81 ) → last digit 1- ( 3^5 = 243 ) → last digit 3- And so on...Since 10 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 2, the last digit of ( 3^{10} ) should be the same as ( 3^2 ), which is 9.So, ( 3^{10} ) ends with 9. Therefore, ( 3^{10} + 1 ) ends with 0. Then, ( a = frac{1}{2} (3^{10} + 1) ) would be half of a number ending with 0, so it should end with 5.Wait, let me verify that. If ( 3^{10} = 59049 ), then ( 59049 + 1 = 59050 ). Dividing that by 2 gives ( 29525 ). So, yes, the last digit is 5.Therefore, ( a ) ends with 5, which means ( a equiv 5 pmod{10} ). So, ( b ) must also be congruent to 5 modulo 10. Looking at the options:A: 2015 → ends with 5B: 2011 → ends with 1C: 2008 → ends with 8D: 2006 → ends with 6Only option A ends with 5, so ( b ) must be 2015.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.1. Recognized the expression as a binomial expansion.2. Factored out 1/2 to get ( a = frac{1}{2}(3^{10} + 1) ).3. Calculated ( 3^{10} ) and found its last digit is 9.4. Therefore, ( 3^{10} + 1 ) ends with 0.5. Divided by 2, so ( a ) ends with 5.6. So, ( a equiv 5 pmod{10} ), and ( b ) must also be 5 mod 10.7. Among the options, only A: 2015 ends with 5.Yes, that seems correct.

The problem says:Given ( P = sqrt{underbrace{111 cdots 1}_{2n} - underbrace{222 cdots 2}_{n}} ) where ( n ) is a natural number, determine the correct statement.And then there are five options: (A) P is an irrational number, (B) P is a number with n digits of 1s, (C) P is a number with n digits of 2s, (D) P is a number with n digits of 3s, and (E) P is a number with n digits of 7s.Alright, so first, I need to understand what these underbraces mean. The first one is a number made up of 2n digits, all 1s. The second one is a number made up of n digits, all 2s. So, for example, if n is 3, the first number would be 111111, and the second would be 222. Then, we subtract the second number from the first and take the square root of the result.I think the key here is to express these numbers in a mathematical form so that I can manipulate them algebraically. Let me recall that a number with k digits all being 1 can be written as (frac{10^k - 1}{9}). Similarly, a number with k digits all being 2 can be written as (2 times frac{10^k - 1}{9}).So, applying this to our problem:The first number, (underbrace{111 cdots 1}_{2n}), is (frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}).The second number, (underbrace{222 cdots 2}_{n}), is (2 times frac{10^n - 1}{9}).So, subtracting the second number from the first, we get:[frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - frac{2(10^n - 1)}{9}]Since both terms have the same denominator, we can combine them:[frac{10^{2n} - 1 - 2(10^n - 1)}{9}]Let me simplify the numerator:First, distribute the 2 in the second term:[10^{2n} - 1 - 2 times 10^n + 2]Combine like terms:[10^{2n} - 2 times 10^n + 1]Hmm, this looks familiar. Wait, that's a perfect square! Because ( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 ). If I let ( a = 10^n ) and ( b = 1 ), then:[(10^n - 1)^2 = 10^{2n} - 2 times 10^n + 1]Yes, exactly! So the numerator simplifies to ( (10^n - 1)^2 ). Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{9}]So, now we have:[P = sqrt{frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{9}}]Taking the square root of a square is the absolute value, but since ( 10^n - 1 ) is positive, we can ignore the absolute value:[P = frac{10^n - 1}{3}]Now, let's think about what ( 10^n - 1 ) is. For example, if n is 1, it's 9; if n is 2, it's 99; if n is 3, it's 999, and so on. So, ( 10^n - 1 ) is a number with n digits, all 9s.Dividing that by 3, we get:If n is 1: 9 / 3 = 3If n is 2: 99 / 3 = 33If n is 3: 999 / 3 = 333So, in general, ( frac{10^n - 1}{3} ) is a number with n digits, all 3s.Therefore, P is equal to a number with n digits of 3s, which is option D.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Expressed both numbers as fractions: correct.2. Subtracted them correctly: yes, combined the fractions and simplified the numerator.3. Recognized the numerator as a perfect square: yes, that was a key step.4. Took the square root and simplified: correct, ended up with ( frac{10^n - 1}{3} ).5. Interpreted ( frac{10^n - 1}{3} ) as a number with n 3s: yes, because 999...9 divided by 3 is 333...3.So, I think my reasoning is solid.

The total amount before brokerage is Rs. 106. What is the percentage of the brokerage?","answer":"First, I need to determine the amount of brokerage paid during the sale of the stock. The total amount before brokerage is Rs. 106, and the cash realized after selling the stock is Rs. 106.25. To find the brokerage amount, I subtract the cash realized from the total amount before brokerage:106 - 106.25 = -0.25This negative value indicates that the seller paid a brokerage fee of Rs. 0.25.Next, to find the percentage of the brokerage, I divide the brokerage amount by the total amount before brokerage and then multiply by 100:(0.25 / 106) * 100 ≈ 0.2358%Therefore, the percentage of the brokerage is approximately 0.2358%."},{"question":"For testing a certain product, there are 6 different genuine items and 4 different defective items. The test continues until all defective items are identified. If all defective items are exactly identified by the 5th test, how many possible testing methods are there?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about testing products. There are 6 genuine items and 4 defective ones. The testing continues until all defective items are found. The question is asking: if all defective items are exactly identified by the 5th test, how many possible testing methods are there?Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for all defective items to be identified by the 5th test. That means that in the first 4 tests, we must have found 3 defective items, and then on the 5th test, we find the last defective one. So, the 5th test is the one that completes the identification of all defective items.Alright, so the key here is that the 5th test must be a defective item, and in the first 4 tests, we have exactly 3 defective items and 1 genuine item. That makes sense because if we had more than 3 defective items in the first 4 tests, we might have already found all 4 before the 5th test, which contradicts the condition that all defective items are identified exactly by the 5th test.So, let's think about how to calculate the number of possible testing methods. I think this involves combinations and permutations because the order of testing matters here.First, let's consider the 5th test. Since it's the last defective item, we need to choose which defective item is identified on the 5th test. There are 4 defective items, so there are 4 choices for this. That would be 4 ways to choose which defective item is last.Next, for the first 4 tests, we have 3 defective items and 1 genuine item. We need to figure out how many ways we can arrange these 4 tests. Since the order matters, this is a permutation problem.But before that, we need to choose which 3 defective items are in the first 4 tests. Since there are 4 defective items in total, choosing 3 of them can be done in C(4,3) ways, which is 4.Similarly, we need to choose which 1 genuine item is in the first 4 tests. There are 6 genuine items, so choosing 1 would be C(6,1) which is 6.Now, once we have selected the 3 defective items and 1 genuine item, we need to arrange these 4 items in order for the first 4 tests. Since all items are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them is 4 factorial, which is 4! = 24.So, putting it all together, the total number of testing methods would be the number of ways to choose the last defective item multiplied by the number of ways to choose the defective items in the first 4 tests, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the genuine item in the first 4 tests, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange these first 4 tests.Mathematically, that would be:Number of testing methods = 4 (choices for last defective) × C(4,3) (choices for defective in first 4) × C(6,1) (choices for genuine in first 4) × 4! (arrangements of first 4 tests)Let me compute that step by step.First, 4 (choices for last defective) is straightforward.C(4,3) is 4, as calculated earlier.C(6,1) is 6.4! is 24.So, multiplying all these together: 4 × 4 × 6 × 24.Let me compute that:4 × 4 = 1616 × 6 = 9696 × 24 = ?Well, 96 × 20 = 192096 × 4 = 384So, 1920 + 384 = 2304Wait, that seems really high. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me double-check. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.Wait, actually, when I choose the last defective item, that's 4 choices. Then, for the first 4 tests, I have 3 defective and 1 genuine. The number of ways to choose which 3 defective items are in the first 4 is C(4,3)=4. The number of ways to choose which genuine item is in the first 4 is C(6,1)=6. Then, arranging these 4 items (3 defective + 1 genuine) in order is 4! =24.So, the total is 4 × 4 × 6 × 24 = 2304.But wait, the initial answer given was 576. So, I must have made a mistake here.Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting because the selection of the defective items and the genuine item is already considered in the permutations.Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Instead of separating the choices, maybe think about it as arranging the first 4 tests with 3 defective and 1 genuine, and then the 5th test is the last defective.So, the number of ways to arrange the first 4 tests is the number of ways to choose 3 defective out of 4 and 1 genuine out of 6, and then arrange them in order.That would be C(4,3) × C(6,1) × 4!.Then, for the 5th test, we have 1 defective left, so it's just 1 way.But wait, no, the 5th test is fixed as the last defective item, but we have 4 choices for which defective item is last.Wait, maybe that's where the confusion is.Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:Total number of testing methods is equal to the number of ways to have the first 4 tests include exactly 3 defective items and 1 genuine item, and then the 5th test is the last defective item.So, the number of ways to choose which defective item is last: 4.Then, the number of ways to arrange the first 4 tests with 3 defective and 1 genuine.To compute that, it's C(4,3) × C(6,1) × 4!.So, that would be 4 × 6 × 24 = 576.Ah, so I see. Earlier, I multiplied by the 4 again, but actually, the 4 choices for the last defective item is separate from the C(4,3). Wait, no, actually, if I choose which defective is last, that's 4, and then the remaining 3 defective are in the first 4 tests. So, actually, the C(4,3) is redundant because once you choose the last defective, the remaining 3 are automatically the ones in the first 4 tests.Wait, so maybe the correct way is:Number of ways = (number of ways to choose the last defective) × (number of ways to arrange the first 4 tests with 3 defective and 1 genuine).So, number of ways to choose the last defective: 4.Number of ways to arrange the first 4 tests: C(6,1) × C(3,3) × 4!.Wait, C(6,1) is choosing 1 genuine out of 6, C(3,3) is choosing all 3 remaining defective items, which is 1 way, and then arranging them in 4! ways.So, that would be 4 × (6 × 1 × 24) = 4 × 144 = 576.Yes, that makes sense. So, the initial answer of 576 is correct.I think my mistake earlier was that I was separately choosing the 3 defective items for the first 4 tests, but actually, once you fix the last defective item, the remaining 3 are automatically the ones in the first 4 tests. So, you don't need to multiply by C(4,3) again because that's already accounted for by choosing the last defective item.Therefore, the correct total number of testing methods is 576."},{"question":"Let a diamond b = dfrac{sqrt{a+b+3}}{sqrt{a-b+1}}. If  y diamond 15 = 5, find y.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where they define an operation called \\"diamond\\" between two numbers a and b. It's given by the formula:[ a diamond b = dfrac{sqrt{a + b + 3}}{sqrt{a - b + 1}} ]And the problem is asking me to find y such that:[ y diamond 15 = 5 ]Alright, let me try to understand what this operation means. It seems like when you \\"diamond\\" two numbers, you take the square root of (a + b + 3) and divide it by the square root of (a - b + 1). So, for y diamond 15, that would be:[ dfrac{sqrt{y + 15 + 3}}{sqrt{y - 15 + 1}} ]Simplifying the numerator and the denominator inside the square roots:Numerator: y + 15 + 3 = y + 18Denominator: y - 15 + 1 = y - 14So, the expression becomes:[ dfrac{sqrt{y + 18}}{sqrt{y - 14}} = 5 ]Hmm, okay. So, I have a fraction of two square roots equal to 5. I need to solve for y. Let me think about how to approach this.First, maybe I can get rid of the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. That should simplify things a bit. Let me try that.Squaring both sides:[ left( dfrac{sqrt{y + 18}}{sqrt{y - 14}} right)^2 = 5^2 ]Which simplifies to:[ dfrac{y + 18}{y - 14} = 25 ]Alright, now I have a rational equation. Let me solve for y. I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator.Multiplying both sides by (y - 14):[ y + 18 = 25(y - 14) ]Expanding the right side:[ y + 18 = 25y - 350 ]Hmm, now I have a linear equation. Let me get all the y terms on one side and constants on the other.Subtract y from both sides:[ 18 = 24y - 350 ]Now, add 350 to both sides:[ 18 + 350 = 24y ]Calculating 18 + 350:18 + 350 = 368So, now I have:[ 368 = 24y ]To solve for y, I can divide both sides by 24:[ y = dfrac{368}{24} ]Simplify this fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 8.368 ÷ 8 = 4624 ÷ 8 = 3So, simplifying:[ y = dfrac{46}{3} ]Wait, let me check if this makes sense. I should verify my solution to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Let me plug y = 46/3 back into the original equation:First, compute y + 18:46/3 + 18 = 46/3 + 54/3 = 100/3Then, compute y - 14:46/3 - 14 = 46/3 - 42/3 = 4/3So, the original expression becomes:[ dfrac{sqrt{100/3}}{sqrt{4/3}} ]Simplify the square roots:sqrt(100/3) = 10/sqrt(3)sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)So, the fraction is:(10/sqrt(3)) / (2/sqrt(3)) = (10/sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 10/2 = 5Which matches the given equation. So, y = 46/3 is indeed the correct solution.I think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the verification confirms that the solution works. So, y is 46/3.**Final Answer**The value of ( y ) is boxed{dfrac{46}{3}}."},{"question":"Let ( f(m, n) ) satisfy the conditionf(m, n) leq f(m, n-1) + f(m-1, n),where ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers, ( m, n geq 2 ), and f(1, n) = f(m, 1) = 1.Prove that ( f(m, n) leq C_{m+n} ).","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to prove that ( f(m, n) leq C_{m+n} ) given the conditions that ( f(m, n) leq f(m, n-1) + f(m-1, n) ) for ( m, n geq 2 ), and ( f(1, n) = f(m, 1) = 1 ). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what ( C_{m+n} ) represents. I think it's a binomial coefficient, right? So, ( C_{m+n} ) is probably ( binom{m+n}{m} ) or ( binom{m+n}{n} ). Both are the same because of the symmetry property of binomial coefficients. So, ( C_{m+n} = binom{m+n}{m} = binom{m+n}{n} ).Now, the function ( f(m, n) ) has a recursive inequality: ( f(m, n) leq f(m, n-1) + f(m-1, n) ). This reminds me of the way binomial coefficients are built up using Pascal's triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. So, maybe there's a connection here.Given that ( f(1, n) = 1 ) and ( f(m, 1) = 1 ), these are like the boundary conditions for the binomial coefficients as well. In Pascal's triangle, the first row and first column are all ones. So, perhaps ( f(m, n) ) is bounded above by the binomial coefficient ( binom{m+n}{m} ).To approach this, I think induction might be a good strategy. Let's try mathematical induction on either ( m ) or ( n ). Maybe I'll fix one variable and induct on the other.Let's start with the base cases. For ( m = 1 ), ( f(1, n) = 1 ). And ( C_{1+n} = binom{1+n}{1} = n+1 ). Wait, but ( 1 leq n+1 ), which is true. Similarly, for ( n = 1 ), ( f(m, 1) = 1 ) and ( C_{m+1} = binom{m+1}{1} = m+1 ), so again ( 1 leq m+1 ), which holds.But wait, actually, ( C_{m+n} ) is ( binom{m+n}{m} ), which for ( m = 1 ) is ( binom{n+1}{1} = n+1 ). So, ( f(1, n) = 1 leq n+1 ), which is true. Similarly, for ( n = 1 ), ( f(m, 1) = 1 leq binom{m+1}{1} = m+1 ), which is also true.Okay, so the base cases hold. Now, let's assume that for some ( m geq 2 ) and ( n geq 2 ), the inequality ( f(m, n) leq binom{m+n}{m} ) holds. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. Induction usually requires assuming it holds for smaller values and then proving it for the next value.Maybe I should use double induction, where I induct on both ( m ) and ( n ). So, assume that for all ( m' < m ) and ( n' < n ), ( f(m', n') leq binom{m' + n'}{m'} ). Then, I need to show that ( f(m, n) leq binom{m + n}{m} ).Given the recursive inequality ( f(m, n) leq f(m, n-1) + f(m-1, n) ), by the induction hypothesis, both ( f(m, n-1) leq binom{m + (n-1)}{m} ) and ( f(m-1, n) leq binom{(m-1) + n}{m-1} ).So, substituting these into the inequality, we get:[ f(m, n) leq binom{m + n - 1}{m} + binom{m + n - 1}{m - 1} ]Now, I recall that there's a property of binomial coefficients that says:[ binom{k}{r} + binom{k}{r - 1} = binom{k + 1}{r} ]Let me verify this. Yes, indeed, ( binom{k}{r} + binom{k}{r - 1} = binom{k + 1}{r} ). This is a standard identity in combinatorics, often used in proofs involving Pascal's triangle.Applying this identity to our case, where ( k = m + n - 1 ) and ( r = m ), we have:[ binom{m + n - 1}{m} + binom{m + n - 1}{m - 1} = binom{m + n}{m} ]Therefore, substituting back into our inequality:[ f(m, n) leq binom{m + n}{m} ]Which is exactly what we wanted to prove. So, by the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality ( f(m, n) leq binom{m + n}{m} ) holds for all positive integers ( m, n geq 1 ).Wait, but the problem specifies ( m, n geq 2 ). Does that affect anything? Well, our base cases were for ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ), which are still valid, and the induction step covers ( m, n geq 2 ). So, I think it's fine.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We used induction on both ( m ) and ( n ), assuming the inequality holds for smaller values, then used the recursive inequality and the binomial coefficient identity to show it holds for the next value. The base cases were straightforward, and the induction step relied on the binomial coefficient identity, which I verified.I think that covers it. So, the proof should be solid."},{"question":"Given that (1 leq x, y, z leq 6), how many cases are there in which the product of natural numbers (x, y, z) is divisible by 10?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here: Given that (1 leq x, y, z leq 6), how many cases are there in which the product of natural numbers (x, y, z) is divisible by 10? Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how many ordered triples ((x, y, z)) there are such that when I multiply them together, the result is divisible by 10.First off, I know that for a number to be divisible by 10, it needs to have both 2 and 5 as factors. So, the product (xyz) must include at least one 2 and at least one 5. That means, in the numbers (x), (y), and (z), there needs to be at least one even number (to provide the factor of 2) and at least one multiple of 5 (to provide the factor of 5).Alright, so let's break this down. The numbers (x), (y), and (z) can each be any integer from 1 to 6. So, the total number of possible ordered triples is (6 times 6 times 6 = 216). That's the total number of cases without any restrictions.Now, I need to find how many of these 216 cases result in a product divisible by 10. To do this, I think it might be easier to calculate the total number of cases where the product is *not* divisible by 10 and then subtract that from the total number of cases.So, the product (xyz) is not divisible by 10 if it lacks either a factor of 2 or a factor of 5. Therefore, I can calculate the number of triples where there are no even numbers (i.e., all numbers are odd) and the number of triples where there are no multiples of 5. Then, I need to be careful not to double-count the cases where both conditions are met—i.e., triples with no even numbers and no multiples of 5.Let's start with the number of triples where all numbers are odd. The odd numbers between 1 and 6 are 1, 3, and 5. So, there are 3 choices for each of (x), (y), and (z). Therefore, the number of such triples is (3 times 3 times 3 = 27).Next, the number of triples where there are no multiples of 5. The numbers from 1 to 6 that are not multiples of 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. So, there are 5 choices for each of (x), (y), and (z). Thus, the number of such triples is (5 times 5 times 5 = 125).Now, I need to find the number of triples where there are neither even numbers nor multiples of 5. That means all numbers must be odd and not multiples of 5. The numbers that fit this are 1 and 3. So, there are 2 choices for each of (x), (y), and (z). Therefore, the number of such triples is (2 times 2 times 2 = 8).Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of triples where the product is not divisible by 10 is the number of all-odd triples plus the number of no-multiples-of-5 triples minus the number of triples that are both all-odd and no-multiples-of-5. So, that's (27 + 125 - 8 = 144).Therefore, the number of triples where the product is divisible by 10 is the total number of triples minus the number of non-divisible triples: (216 - 144 = 72).Wait, let me double-check that. So, total cases: 216. Cases where product is not divisible by 10: 144. So, 216 - 144 should be 72. Yeah, that seems right.Just to make sure, let me think about it another way. For the product to be divisible by 10, we need at least one even number and at least one multiple of 5.So, maybe I can calculate it directly by considering the different ways to have at least one even and at least one multiple of 5.First, let's find the number of triples that include at least one multiple of 5. There are two multiples of 5 between 1 and 6: 5 and 10, but wait, 10 is not in the range, so only 5. So, only one multiple of 5: 5.So, the number of triples that include at least one 5 is equal to the total number of triples minus the number of triples with no 5s. We already calculated the number of triples with no 5s as 125. So, the number of triples with at least one 5 is (216 - 125 = 91).Now, among these 91 triples, we need to ensure that there's also at least one even number. So, how many of these 91 triples have all odd numbers? Because if all numbers are odd, then even though there's a 5, there's no even number, so the product won't be divisible by 10.So, how many triples have at least one 5 and all numbers odd? Well, the numbers can be 1, 3, or 5. So, for each position, if we have at least one 5, the number of such triples is equal to the total number of triples with numbers 1, 3, 5 minus the number of triples with no 5s. The total number of triples with numbers 1, 3, 5 is (3^3 = 27). The number of triples with no 5s is (2^3 = 8) (since only 1 and 3 are allowed). So, the number of triples with at least one 5 and all numbers odd is (27 - 8 = 19).Therefore, the number of triples with at least one 5 and at least one even number is (91 - 19 = 72). That matches the previous result.So, both methods give me 72. That seems consistent.Alternatively, I could think about it as:To have the product divisible by 10, we need at least one even number and at least one multiple of 5. So, we can think about the different cases:1. Exactly one of x, y, z is even and exactly one is 5.2. Exactly one of x, y, z is even and more than one is 5.3. More than one of x, y, z is even and exactly one is 5.4. More than one of x, y, z is even and more than one is 5.But this seems more complicated because it involves considering multiple cases. The inclusion-exclusion method seems more straightforward.Another way is to calculate the probability, but since we're dealing with exact counts, it's better to stick with combinatorial methods.So, in summary, using inclusion-exclusion, we found that the number of triples where the product is not divisible by 10 is 144, so the number of triples where it is divisible by 10 is 72.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Both approaches—calculating the complement and calculating directly—give the same result, which is reassuring."},{"question":"Find a 3 times 3 matrix mathbf{M} such that [mathbf{M} mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} -3  5  -6 end{pmatrix} mathbf{v}] for all three-dimensional vectors mathbf{v}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find a 3x3 matrix M such that when I multiply M by any three-dimensional vector v, the result is the same as multiplying v by the vector [-3, 5, -6]. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first, but let me try to unpack it step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The equation given is:M * v = [-3, 5, -6] * vBut wait, how does that multiplication work? If v is a 3-dimensional vector, then [-3, 5, -6] is also a 3-dimensional vector. So, when they say [-3, 5, -6] * v, are they talking about the dot product or something else? Because the dot product would result in a scalar, not another vector. But on the left side, M * v is a matrix multiplied by a vector, which should give another vector. So, that doesn't quite add up.Maybe I misinterpret the notation. Perhaps [-3, 5, -6] * v is meant to be a scalar multiplication, but that doesn't make sense either because [-3, 5, -6] is a vector, not a scalar. Wait, unless they're using some kind of component-wise multiplication? Like, multiplying each component of v by the corresponding component of [-3, 5, -6]. So, if v is [v1, v2, v3], then [-3, 5, -6] * v would be [-3*v1, 5*v2, -6*v3]. Is that what they mean?That seems plausible. So, essentially, M is a matrix that, when multiplied by any vector v, scales each component of v by -3, 5, and -6 respectively. So, M is a diagonal matrix with -3, 5, and -6 on the diagonal. Because when you multiply a diagonal matrix by a vector, each component of the vector gets scaled by the corresponding diagonal element.Let me test this idea. Suppose M is:[ -3  0    0 ][ 0    5    0 ][ 0    0   -6 ]Then, multiplying M by v = [v1, v2, v3] would give:[ -3*v1 + 0*v2 + 0*v3 ][ 0*v1 + 5*v2 + 0*v3 ][ 0*v1 + 0*v2 + (-6)*v3 ]Which simplifies to:[ -3*v1 ][ 5*v2  ][ -6*v3 ]Which is exactly the same as [-3, 5, -6] * v if we interpret that as component-wise multiplication. So, that seems to fit.But wait, the problem says \\"for all three-dimensional vectors v.\\" So, this matrix M should work for any vector v. Let me pick a specific vector to test. Let's say v = [1, 1, 1]. Then, M * v should be [-3, 5, -6]. Let's compute M * v:[ -3*1 + 0*1 + 0*1 ] = -3[ 0*1 + 5*1 + 0*1 ] = 5[ 0*1 + 0*1 + (-6)*1 ] = -6Yes, that works. Let's try another vector, say v = [2, 3, 4]. Then, M * v should be [-6, 15, -24]. Let's compute:[ -3*2 + 0*3 + 0*4 ] = -6[ 0*2 + 5*3 + 0*4 ] = 15[ 0*2 + 0*3 + (-6)*4 ] = -24Perfect, that's correct. So, it seems like the matrix M is indeed a diagonal matrix with the entries -3, 5, and -6 on the diagonal.But just to be thorough, let me consider if there could be any other matrix that satisfies this condition. Suppose M is not diagonal. Then, there would be off-diagonal elements that could potentially affect the result. For example, if M had a non-zero element in the first row, second column, say a, then when we multiply M by a vector v, the first component would be -3*v1 + a*v2. But according to the problem, the first component should only be -3*v1, regardless of v2 and v3. Therefore, a must be zero. Similarly, all off-diagonal elements must be zero to ensure that each component of the resulting vector only depends on the corresponding component of v.Therefore, the only matrix M that satisfies M * v = [-3, 5, -6] * v for all vectors v is the diagonal matrix with -3, 5, and -6 on the diagonal.So, putting it all together, the matrix M is:[ -3  0    0 ][ 0    5    0 ][ 0    0   -6 ]I think that's the solution. It makes sense because diagonal matrices are used for scaling each component of a vector independently, which is exactly what we need here."},{"question":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?A: The line passing through points M(x_{1}, y_{1}) and N(x_{2}, y_{2}) can be represented by the equation frac{{y-y_{1}}}{{y_{2}-y_{1}}}=frac{{x-x_{1}}}{{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.B: The equation of the line passing through the point P(1,0) with a slope of alpha is y=(x-1)cdot tan alpha.C: The line mx-(m-1)y-4=0 (where min R) must pass through the first quadrant.D: Lines with equal intercepts can all be represented by the equation x+y=a (where ain R).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the statements A, B, C, or D is incorrect. Let me take each statement one by one and think through them carefully.Starting with Statement A: \\"The line passing through points M(x₁, y₁) and N(x₂, y₂) can be represented by the equation (y - y₁)/(y₂ - y₁) = (x - x₁)/(x₂ - x₁).\\" Hmm, I remember that the equation of a line can be found using the two-point form, which is exactly what this is. But wait, isn't there a condition where this might not work? If the two points have the same x-coordinate, meaning x₁ = x₂, then the denominator on the right side becomes zero, which would make the equation undefined. So, in that case, the line is vertical, and its equation would be x = x₁, not the one given here. So, Statement A might be incorrect if x₁ equals x₂. I'll keep that in mind.Moving on to Statement B: \\"The equation of the line passing through the point P(1,0) with a slope of α is y = (x - 1) * tan α.\\" Okay, the point-slope form of a line is y - y₁ = m(x - x₁), where m is the slope. Here, they're using tan α as the slope, which makes sense if α is the angle the line makes with the x-axis. But wait, tan α is undefined when α is 90 degrees because tan(90°) is undefined. So, if α is 90°, the line would be vertical, and its equation would be x = 1, not y = (x - 1) * tan α. Therefore, Statement B is incorrect when α is 90°, which means it's not always correct.Now, Statement C: \\"The line mx - (m - 1)y - 4 = 0 (where m ∈ R) must pass through the first quadrant.\\" Let me try to analyze this. First, I can rewrite the equation to make it easier to understand. Let's rearrange it:mx - (m - 1)y = 4I can factor out m:m(x - y) + y = 4Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should find the x-intercept and y-intercept to see where the line crosses the axes. For the x-intercept, set y = 0:mx - 0 - 4 = 0 => mx = 4 => x = 4/mFor the y-intercept, set x = 0:0 - (m - 1)y - 4 = 0 => -(m - 1)y = 4 => y = -4/(m - 1)So, the x-intercept is 4/m and the y-intercept is -4/(m - 1). Now, to determine if the line passes through the first quadrant, we need to see if both intercepts are positive or if the line crosses the first quadrant somewhere else.Let's consider different values of m:1. If m > 0:   - x-intercept: 4/m > 0   - y-intercept: -4/(m - 1). The sign depends on m - 1.     - If m > 1, then m - 1 > 0, so y-intercept is negative.     - If 0 < m < 1, then m - 1 < 0, so y-intercept is positive.   So, if m > 1, x-intercept is positive, y-intercept is negative. The line crosses the x-axis in the first quadrant and the y-axis in the fourth quadrant. Depending on the slope, it might pass through the first quadrant.   If 0 < m < 1, both intercepts are positive, so the line definitely passes through the first quadrant.2. If m < 0:   - x-intercept: 4/m < 0   - y-intercept: -4/(m - 1). Since m < 0, m - 1 < -1, so denominator is negative, so y-intercept is positive.   So, x-intercept is negative, y-intercept is positive. The line crosses the x-axis in the second quadrant and the y-axis in the first quadrant. Depending on the slope, it might pass through the first quadrant.3. If m = 0:   - The equation becomes 0 - (-1)y - 4 = 0 => y - 4 = 0 => y = 4. This is a horizontal line passing through y = 4, which is entirely in the first and second quadrants.4. If m = 1:   - The equation becomes 1*x - (1 - 1)y - 4 = 0 => x - 0 - 4 = 0 => x = 4. This is a vertical line passing through x = 4, which is in the first and fourth quadrants.So, in all cases, the line either passes through the first quadrant or is entirely in the first quadrant. Therefore, Statement C seems to be correct.Finally, Statement D: \\"Lines with equal intercepts can all be represented by the equation x + y = a (where a ∈ R).\\" Hmm, equal intercepts mean that the x-intercept and y-intercept are the same. So, if a line has equal intercepts, say both equal to k, then the equation can be written as x/k + y/k = 1, which simplifies to x + y = k. So, yes, it can be represented as x + y = a, where a = k.But wait, is that the only form? What about lines that pass through the origin? If a line passes through the origin, its intercepts are both zero, so it can be represented as y = mx, but this isn't captured by x + y = a unless a = 0. So, in that case, x + y = 0 is a specific case where the line passes through the origin with slope -1. But there are other lines passing through the origin with different slopes that also have equal intercepts (both zero). So, can all lines with equal intercepts be represented by x + y = a?Wait, if a line has equal intercepts, say both equal to k, then it's x + y = k. But if k = 0, it's x + y = 0, which is a specific line. However, lines like y = x also have equal intercepts (both zero), but they can't be represented by x + y = a unless a = 0, but y = x is different from x + y = 0. Wait, no, y = x is actually x - y = 0, which is different from x + y = 0.So, does that mean that not all lines with equal intercepts can be represented by x + y = a? Because y = x is a line with equal intercepts (both zero), but it's not of the form x + y = a unless a = 0, but even then, x + y = 0 is a different line from y = x.Wait, actually, if a line has equal intercepts, it can be written as x + y = a or x - y = a, depending on the slope. So, maybe the statement is incorrect because it only considers x + y = a, but there are other forms as well.But hold on, if the intercepts are equal, say both are k, then the equation is x/k + y/k = 1, which simplifies to x + y = k. So, it should be x + y = a where a is k. But what about lines like y = x? That has intercepts at (0,0) and (0,0), which are equal, but it's not x + y = a unless a = 0, but y = x is different from x + y = 0.Wait, no, if a = 0, x + y = 0 is the line y = -x, not y = x. So, y = x is a different line with equal intercepts (both zero) but cannot be represented by x + y = a. Therefore, Statement D is incorrect because not all lines with equal intercepts can be represented by x + y = a; some require a different form like x - y = a.So, summarizing:- Statement A is incorrect when x₁ = x₂.- Statement B is incorrect when α = 90°.- Statement C is correct.- Statement D is incorrect because not all lines with equal intercepts can be represented by x + y = a.Therefore, the incorrect statements are A, B, and D."},{"question":"Find the matrix mathbf{N} such that[mathbf{N} mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} 3  -1  7 end{pmatrix} times mathbf{w}]for all vectors mathbf{w}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a matrix **N** such that when I multiply **N** by any vector **w**, it's the same as taking the cross product of the vector (3, -1, 7) with **w**. Hmm, cross products... I remember they result in a vector that's perpendicular to both of the original vectors. But how do I represent that as a matrix multiplication?Let me think. I know that cross products can be represented using matrices. Specifically, for any vector **v** = (v₁, v₂, v₃), the cross product **v** × **w** can be written as a matrix multiplication where the matrix is constructed from the components of **v**. I think the matrix is something like:[  0  -v₃   v₂ ][  v₃   0  -v₁ ][ -v₂  v₁   0 ]Is that right? Let me double-check. If I take **v** = (v₁, v₂, v₃) and **w** = (w₁, w₂, w₃), then the cross product **v** × **w** is:(v₂w₃ - v₃w₂, v₃w₁ - v₁w₃, v₁w₂ - v₂w₁)Now, if I multiply the matrix I wrote above with **w**, let's see:First component: 0*w₁ + (-v₃)*w₂ + v₂*w₃ = -v₃w₂ + v₂w₃Second component: v₃*w₁ + 0*w₂ + (-v₁)*w₃ = v₃w₁ - v₁w₃Third component: (-v₂)*w₁ + v₁*w₂ + 0*w₃ = -v₂w₁ + v₁w₂Which matches the cross product formula. Okay, so that matrix is correct.So, given that **v** is (3, -1, 7), let's plug these into the matrix.v₁ = 3, v₂ = -1, v₃ = 7So, substituting into the matrix:First row: 0, -v₃, v₂ → 0, -7, -1Second row: v₃, 0, -v₁ → 7, 0, -3Third row: -v₂, v₁, 0 → 1, 3, 0Wait, hold on.

Let's take a general vector **w** = (a, b, c) and compute both **N** **w** and (3, -1, 7) × **w** to see if they are the same.First, compute **N** **w**:First component: 0*a + (-7)*b + (-1)*c = -7b - cSecond component: 7*a + 0*b + (-3)*c = 7a - 3cThird component: 1*a + 3*b + 0*c = a + 3bNow, compute the cross product (3, -1, 7) × (a, b, c):Using the cross product formula:i component: (-1)*c - 7*b = -c -7bj component: 7*a - 3*c = 7a - 3ck component: 3*b - (-1)*a = 3b + aSo, the cross product is (-7b - c, 7a - 3c, a + 3b)Comparing this with **N** **w**, which is (-7b - c, 7a - 3c, a + 3b), they are the same. So, the matrix **N** is correct.Wait, but in my initial substitution, I got the third component as a + 3b, but in the cross product, it's 3b + a, which is the same. So, everything checks out.Therefore, the matrix **N** is:[ 0   -7   -1 ][ 7    0   -3 ][ 1    3    0 ]I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any signs or components.Looking back at the cross product formula:**v** × **w** = (v₂w₃ - v₃w₂, v₃w₁ - v₁w₃, v₁w₂ - v₂w₁)Plugging in v₁=3, v₂=-1, v₃=7:First component: (-1)c - 7b = -c -7bSecond component: 7a - 3cThird component: 3b - (-1)a = 3b + aWhich matches the matrix multiplication result.Yes, so I think I did it correctly. The matrix **N** is as above."},{"question":"Given a quadratic function f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c where a,b in R, aneq 0, it satisfies the following conditions:1. When x in R, the graph of f(x) is symmetrical about the line x=-1.2. f(1)=1.3. The minimum value of f(x) in R is 0.(1) Find the analytical expression of the function f(x).(2) Find the largest m(m > 1) such that there exists t in R so that for any x in [1,m], it satisfies f(x+t)leqslant x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c, and I need to find its analytical expression based on the given conditions. Let me go through each condition step by step.First, the graph of f(x) is symmetrical about the line x = -1. I remember that for a quadratic function, the axis of symmetry is given by x = -b/(2a). So, if the axis of symmetry is x = -1, that means:-b/(2a) = -1Multiplying both sides by 2a gives:-b = -2aSo, b = 2a. That's my first equation.Next, condition 2 says f(1) = 1. Let's plug x = 1 into the function:f(1) = a(1)² + b(1) + c = a + b + c = 1So, a + b + c = 1. That's my second equation.Condition 3 states that the minimum value of f(x) is 0. Since it's a quadratic function and the minimum is 0, the vertex of the parabola is at (h, 0), where h is the x-coordinate of the vertex. We already know the axis of symmetry is x = -1, so the vertex is at (-1, 0). The vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)² + k. Plugging in h = -1 and k = 0, we get:f(x) = a(x + 1)²Expanding this, f(x) = a(x² + 2x + 1) = ax² + 2ax + aComparing this with the standard form f(x) = ax² + bx + c, we can see that b = 2a and c = a. Wait, but from condition 2, we have a + b + c = 1. Since b = 2a and c = a, substituting these into the equation gives:a + 2a + a = 1 => 4a = 1 => a = 1/4So, a = 1/4, which means b = 2*(1/4) = 1/2 and c = 1/4.Therefore, the function is f(x) = (1/4)x² + (1/2)x + 1/4.Let me double-check if this satisfies all the conditions.1. Axis of symmetry: x = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*(1/4)) = -(1/2)/(1/2) = -1. Correct.2. f(1) = (1/4)(1) + (1/2)(1) + 1/4 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Correct.3. Minimum value: Since a = 1/4 > 0, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is at (-1, 0). So the minimum value is indeed 0. Correct.Great, so part (1) is solved.Now, moving on to part (2). I need to find the largest m > 1 such that there exists a real number t where for any x in [1, m], f(x + t) ≤ x.Hmm, okay. So, f(x + t) is a horizontal shift of the function f(x). Since f(x) is a parabola opening upwards, shifting it left or right will affect where it intersects the line y = x.We want f(x + t) ≤ x for all x in [1, m]. So, the graph of f(x + t) should lie below or on the line y = x from x = 1 to x = m.To find the largest m, I think we need to find the maximum x where f(x + t) intersects y = x. That intersection point will give us the value of m.So, let's set f(x + t) = x and solve for x. Since f(x) = (1/4)(x + 1)², then f(x + t) = (1/4)(x + t + 1)².Set this equal to x:(1/4)(x + t + 1)² = xMultiply both sides by 4:(x + t + 1)² = 4xExpand the left side:x² + 2(t + 1)x + (t + 1)² = 4xBring all terms to one side:x² + 2(t + 1)x + (t + 1)² - 4x = 0Combine like terms:x² + [2(t + 1) - 4]x + (t + 1)² = 0Simplify the coefficient of x:2(t + 1) - 4 = 2t + 2 - 4 = 2t - 2So, the equation becomes:x² + (2t - 2)x + (t + 1)² = 0This is a quadratic equation in x. For this equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. But since we are looking for the intersection points, we can proceed.We know that x = 1 is a solution because at x = 1, f(1 + t) should equal 1. Let's verify:f(1 + t) = (1/4)(1 + t + 1)² = (1/4)(t + 2)²Set this equal to 1:(1/4)(t + 2)² = 1 => (t + 2)² = 4 => t + 2 = ±2 => t = 0 or t = -4So, t can be 0 or -4.If t = 0, then f(x) = (1/4)(x + 1)². Let's see where f(x) intersects y = x.Set (1/4)(x + 1)² = x => (x + 1)² = 4x => x² + 2x + 1 = 4x => x² - 2x + 1 = 0 => (x - 1)² = 0 => x = 1So, the only intersection point is at x = 1. But we need m > 1, so t = 0 is not suitable.Now, let's try t = -4.Then, f(x - 4) = (1/4)(x - 4 + 1)² = (1/4)(x - 3)²Set this equal to x:(1/4)(x - 3)² = x => (x - 3)² = 4x => x² - 6x + 9 = 4x => x² - 10x + 9 = 0Solve this quadratic equation:x = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 36)] / 2 = [10 ± sqrt(64)] / 2 = [10 ± 8] / 2So, x = (10 + 8)/2 = 18/2 = 9 or x = (10 - 8)/2 = 2/2 = 1So, the intersection points are at x = 1 and x = 9. Since we need m > 1, the largest m is 9.Therefore, the largest m is 9."},{"question":"Using Kellogg's method, find the smallest eigenvalue of the kernel ( K(x, t) = x^{2} t^{2} ) for ( 0 leqslant x, t leqslant 1 ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the smallest eigenvalue of the kernel ( K(x, t) = x^2 t^2 ) for ( 0 leq x, t leq 1 ) using Kellogg's method. Hmm, I remember that Kellogg's method is related to approximating eigenvalues of integral equations, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact steps. Let me try to recall and work through it.First, I think Kellogg's method involves iteratively improving an initial guess for the eigenvalue. It uses a sequence of functions to approximate the eigenfunction and then extracts the eigenvalue from the ratio of successive approximations. So, I need to start with an initial function, maybe something simple like ( omega_0(x) = x ). That seems reasonable.Next, I need to compute the first iteration, ( omega_1(x) ), by integrating the kernel multiplied by the initial function. The formula should be something like:[omega_1(x) = int_{0}^{1} K(x, t) omega_0(t) dt]Substituting the given kernel and initial function:[omega_1(x) = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot t , dt = x^2 int_{0}^{1} t^3 dt]Calculating the integral:[int_{0}^{1} t^3 dt = left[ frac{t^4}{4} right]_0^1 = frac{1}{4}]So, ( omega_1(x) = frac{x^2}{4} ). That seems straightforward.Now, for the next iteration, ( omega_2(x) ), I need to use ( omega_1(x) ):[omega_2(x) = int_{0}^{1} K(x, t) omega_1(t) dt = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot frac{t^2}{4} dt = frac{x^2}{4} int_{0}^{1} t^4 dt]Calculating the integral:[int_{0}^{1} t^4 dt = left[ frac{t^5}{5} right]_0^1 = frac{1}{5}]So, ( omega_2(x) = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5} ).I notice a pattern here. Each time I iterate, the denominator gets multiplied by 5. Let me check if this continues for ( omega_3(x) ):[omega_3(x) = int_{0}^{1} K(x, t) omega_2(t) dt = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot frac{t^2}{4 cdot 5} dt = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5} int_{0}^{1} t^4 dt = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5^2}]Yes, it does. So, in general, it seems that:[omega_n(x) = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5^{n-1}}]That's a good observation. Now, I need to find the norm of these functions to apply Kellogg's method. The norm is usually the ( L^2 ) norm, which involves integrating the square of the function over the interval.So, let's compute ( |omega_n(x)| ):[|omega_n(x)| = sqrt{int_{0}^{1} left( frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5^{n-1}} right)^2 dx} = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n-1}} sqrt{int_{0}^{1} x^4 dx}]Calculating the integral:[int_{0}^{1} x^4 dx = left[ frac{x^5}{5} right]_0^1 = frac{1}{5}]So,[|omega_n(x)| = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n-1}} cdot sqrt{frac{1}{5}} = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n-1} cdot sqrt{5}}]Simplifying that:[|omega_n(x)| = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n - frac{1}{2}}}]Now, according to Kellogg's method, the eigenvalue ( lambda ) can be approximated by the ratio of successive norms:[lambda approx frac{|omega_{n-1}(x)|}{|omega_n(x)|}]Substituting the expressions for the norms:[lambda approx frac{frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{(n-1) - frac{1}{2}}}}{frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n - frac{1}{2}}}} = frac{5^{n - frac{1}{2}}}{5^{(n-1) - frac{1}{2}}} = 5]So, it looks like the ratio simplifies to 5, regardless of ( n ). That suggests that the smallest eigenvalue is 5.Wait, but I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the calculations again.Starting with ( omega_0(x) = x ), then:[omega_1(x) = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot t , dt = x^2 cdot frac{1}{4}]That's correct.Then:[omega_2(x) = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot frac{t^2}{4} dt = frac{x^2}{4} cdot frac{1}{5}]Yes, that's right.And:[omega_3(x) = int_{0}^{1} x^2 t^2 cdot frac{t^2}{4 cdot 5} dt = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5} cdot frac{1}{5} = frac{x^2}{4 cdot 5^2}]So, the pattern holds.Calculating the norm:[|omega_n(x)| = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n-1}} cdot sqrt{frac{1}{5}} = frac{1}{4 cdot 5^{n - frac{1}{2}}}]That seems correct.Then, the ratio:[frac{|omega_{n-1}(x)|}{|omega_n(x)|} = frac{5^{n - frac{1}{2}}}{5^{(n-1) - frac{1}{2}}} = 5]Yes, that's consistent.So, I think my calculations are correct, and the smallest eigenvalue is indeed 5."},{"question":"Points (( sqrt{e}, a)) and (( sqrt{e}, b)) are distinct points on the graph of (y^2 + x^6 = 3x^3 y + 1). What is (|a-b|)?A) ( sqrt{5} )B) ( sqrt{5e^3 + 4} )C) ( 2 )D) ( 3e^{3/2} )E) ( e^3 + 1 )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the absolute difference between two y-values, a and b, for the points (√e, a) and (√e, b) that lie on the graph of the equation y² + x⁶ = 3x³y + 1. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, since both points have the same x-coordinate, √e, I can substitute x = √e into the equation to find the corresponding y-values. That makes sense because if two points share the same x-coordinate on a graph, their y-values must satisfy the equation for that specific x.So, substituting x = √e into the equation:y² + (√e)⁶ = 3(√e)³y + 1Hmm, let me compute each term separately to avoid mistakes. Starting with (√e)⁶. Remember that (√e) is the same as e^(1/2). So, raising that to the 6th power would be (e^(1/2))⁶ = e^(6*(1/2)) = e³. Okay, so (√e)⁶ is e³.Next, (√e)³. Again, that's (e^(1/2))³ = e^(3/2). So, 3 times (√e)³ is 3e^(3/2).So, substituting back into the equation:y² + e³ = 3e^(3/2)y + 1Now, let me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of y. I'll move all terms to one side:y² - 3e^(3/2)y + (e³ - 1) = 0Alright, so now I have a quadratic equation: y² - 3e^(3/2)y + (e³ - 1) = 0. To find the values of y, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients from the quadratic equation.In this case, a = 1, b = -3e^(3/2), and c = e³ - 1. Plugging these into the quadratic formula:y = [3e^(3/2) ± √( ( -3e^(3/2) )² - 4 * 1 * (e³ - 1) ) ] / (2 * 1)Simplify inside the square root first:( -3e^(3/2) )² = 9e³And 4 * 1 * (e³ - 1) = 4e³ - 4So, the discriminant becomes:9e³ - (4e³ - 4) = 9e³ - 4e³ + 4 = 5e³ + 4So now, the equation for y is:y = [3e^(3/2) ± √(5e³ + 4)] / 2Therefore, the two y-values are:y₁ = [3e^(3/2) + √(5e³ + 4)] / 2andy₂ = [3e^(3/2) - √(5e³ + 4)] / 2Now, the problem asks for |a - b|, which is the absolute difference between these two y-values. Let's compute that:|a - b| = |y₁ - y₂| = | [3e^(3/2) + √(5e³ + 4)] / 2 - [3e^(3/2) - √(5e³ + 4)] / 2 |Simplify the expression inside the absolute value:= | [3e^(3/2) + √(5e³ + 4) - 3e^(3/2) + √(5e³ + 4)] / 2 |The 3e^(3/2) terms cancel out:= | [2√(5e³ + 4)] / 2 |Simplify further:= | √(5e³ + 4) |Since the square root function always yields a non-negative result, the absolute value is redundant here. So, |a - b| = √(5e³ + 4).Looking back at the options provided:A) √5B) √(5e³ + 4)C) 2D) 3e^(3/2)E) e³ + 1It seems that option B is exactly what we got: √(5e³ + 4). So, the answer should be B.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the discriminant part:We had y² - 3e^(3/2)y + (e³ - 1) = 0Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = ( -3e^(3/2) )² - 4*1*(e³ - 1) = 9e³ - 4e³ + 4 = 5e³ + 4. Yep, that's correct.Then, the solutions are [3e^(3/2) ± √(5e³ + 4)] / 2, so the difference is 2√(5e³ + 4)/2 = √(5e³ + 4).

They've given me 20 scores, and I need to fill in some blanks, find a central angle for a pie chart, and estimate the number of people with scores not less than 90 out of 1400 parents. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the data they've provided. There are 20 scores listed:88, 81, 96, 86, 97, 95, 90, 100, 87, 80,85, 86, 82, 90, 90, 100, 100, 94, 93, 100.Alright, so these are the scores of 20 parents. They've also organized the data into four ranges:- 80 ≤ x < 85: 3 scores- 85 ≤ x < 90: 5 scores- 90 ≤ x < 95: a scores- 95 ≤ x < 100: 7 scoresSo, they've given me the frequency for three of the ranges, and I need to find 'a'. Since the total number of scores is 20, I can calculate 'a' by subtracting the known frequencies from 20.Let me do that: 3 (for 80-85) + 5 (for 85-90) + 7 (for 95-100) = 15. So, 20 - 15 = 5. Therefore, 'a' should be 5.Wait, let me double-check that. If I count the scores in each range:Looking at the scores:80: 80 is in 80-85.81: 80-85.82: 80-85.85: 85-90.86: 85-90.86: 85-90.87: 85-90.88: 85-90.90: 90-95.90: 90-95.90: 90-95.93: 90-95.94: 90-95.95: 95-100.96: 95-100.97: 95-100.100: 95-100.100: 95-100.100: 95-100.100: 95-100.Wait, that's 20 scores. Let me count how many are in each range:80-85: 80, 81, 82 → 3 scores.85-90: 85, 86, 86, 87, 88 → 5 scores.90-95: 90, 90, 90, 93, 94 → 5 scores.95-100: 95, 96, 97, 100, 100, 100, 100 → 7 scores.Yes, that adds up to 3+5+5+7=20. So, 'a' is indeed 5.Alright, so part (1) first blank is a=5.Next, they want the median, which is 'b'. The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 20 scores, which is even, the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th scores.Let me order the scores:80, 81, 82, 85, 86, 86, 87, 88, 90, 90, 90, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 100, 100, 100, 100.So, the 10th score is 90, and the 11th score is also 90. Therefore, the median is (90 + 90)/2 = 90. So, b=90.Lastly, the mode, which is 'c'. The mode is the most frequently occurring score. Looking at the scores:80: once81: once82: once85: once86: twice87: once88: once90: three times93: once94: once95: once96: once97: once100: four times.So, the score that appears most frequently is 100, which appears four times. Therefore, c=100.So, for part (1), a=5, b=90, c=100.Moving on to part (2): If this set of data is represented by a pie chart, the central angle of the sector corresponding to the range 90 ≤ x < 95 is ______ degrees.Alright, so in a pie chart, each category's central angle is proportional to its frequency. The formula for the central angle is:Central angle = (Frequency of the category / Total number of data points) × 360 degrees.We already know the frequency for 90 ≤ x < 95 is 'a', which we found to be 5. The total number of data points is 20.So, Central angle = (5 / 20) × 360 = (1/4) × 360 = 90 degrees.Therefore, the central angle is 90 degrees.Now, part (3): 1400 parents participated in this questionnaire evaluation activity. Estimate the number of people with scores not less than 90 among the 1400 parents through sampling analysis.Alright, so we need to estimate how many of the 1400 parents scored 90 or above. In our sample of 20, how many scored 90 or above?Looking back at our data:Scores not less than 90 are 90, 90, 90, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 100, 100, 100, 100.That's 12 scores out of 20.So, the proportion of scores not less than 90 is 12/20 = 3/5.Therefore, if we estimate for 1400 parents, the number of people with scores not less than 90 would be:1400 × (12/20) = 1400 × (3/5) = 840.So, the estimated number is 840.Wait, let me double-check that. 12 out of 20 is 60%, so 60% of 1400 is indeed 840. Yep, that seems right.So, summarizing:(1) a=5, b=90, c=100(2) Central angle is 90 degrees(3) Estimated number is 840I think that covers all the parts. Let me just go through once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For part (1), counting the frequencies again:80-85: 385-90: 590-95: 595-100:7Total: 20. Correct.Median: 10th and 11th terms are both 90. Correct.Mode: 100 appears four times, which is more than any other score. Correct.Part (2): 5 out of 20 is 1/4, so 90 degrees. Correct.Part (3): 12 out of 20 is 3/5, so 840. Correct.Alright, I think I'm confident with these answers."},{"question":"Given a moving point P, two tangents PA and PB are drawn to the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=1, with tangent points A and B respectively, and angle{APB}=60^{circ}.

I need to find the trajectory equation of the moving point P. Alright, let's start by visualizing the problem. There's a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1. Point P is somewhere outside this circle, and from P, we can draw two tangent lines to the circle, touching it at points A and B. The angle between these two tangents at P is 60 degrees. So, I need to find the path that point P takes as it moves such that this angle remains 60 degrees.First, I remember that the tangent to a circle from an external point is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB, where O is the center of the circle. Since the circle is x² + y² = 1, the center O is at (0,0), and the radius is 1.Let me denote the coordinates of point P as (x, y). The distance from P to the center O is then sqrt(x² + y²). Let's call this distance d. So, d = sqrt(x² + y²).Now, since PA and PB are tangents from P to the circle, the lengths PA and PB are equal. I remember that the length of a tangent from an external point to a circle is given by sqrt(d² - r²), where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, r = 1, so PA = PB = sqrt(d² - 1).Given that angle APB is 60 degrees, I can consider triangle APB. In this triangle, sides PA and PB are equal, so it's an isosceles triangle with PA = PB and angle APB = 60 degrees. Wait, actually, if two sides are equal and the angle between them is 60 degrees, then the triangle is equilateral. So, does that mean PA = PB = AB?Hmm, maybe. Let me think. If triangle APB is equilateral, then all sides are equal, so PA = PB = AB. But AB is a chord of the circle. The length of chord AB can be related to the central angle AOB. Since OA and OB are radii, triangle AOB is also isosceles with OA = OB = 1.The central angle AOB is related to the angle APB. I recall that the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to the angle subtended by the chord AB at the center. Wait, no, actually, it's supplementary. The angle between the tangents is equal to the angle subtended by the chord AB at the center, but on the opposite side. So, if angle APB is 60 degrees, then angle AOB is 120 degrees.Yes, that makes sense because the angle between the tangents is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the central angle. So, angle APB = 180° - angle AOB. Therefore, angle AOB = 180° - 60° = 120°.So, angle AOB is 120 degrees. Now, in triangle AOB, OA = OB = 1, and angle AOB = 120°, so I can find the length of chord AB using the Law of Cosines.Law of Cosines says that AB² = OA² + OB² - 2 * OA * OB * cos(angle AOB). Plugging in the values, AB² = 1² + 1² - 2 * 1 * 1 * cos(120°). Cos(120°) is equal to -0.5, so AB² = 1 + 1 - 2*(-0.5) = 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, AB = sqrt(3).So, chord AB has length sqrt(3). Now, in triangle APB, which is equilateral, all sides are equal, so PA = PB = AB = sqrt(3). But earlier, I had that PA = sqrt(d² - 1). So, setting these equal, sqrt(d² - 1) = sqrt(3). Squaring both sides, d² - 1 = 3, so d² = 4, which means d = 2.Therefore, the distance from point P to the center O is 2. So, the coordinates (x, y) of point P satisfy sqrt(x² + y²) = 2, which implies x² + y² = 4.Wait, so the trajectory of point P is the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. That seems straightforward, but let me verify.Alternatively, I can think about the locus of points P such that the angle between the two tangents to the circle x² + y² = 1 is 60 degrees. I remember that for a given circle, the locus of points from which the angle between the two tangents is constant is another circle concentric with the original circle.The radius of this locus circle can be found using the formula involving the angle between the tangents. The formula is: if θ is the angle between the tangents, then the radius R of the locus circle is related to the radius r of the original circle by R = r / sin(θ/2).In this case, θ = 60°, so R = 1 / sin(30°) = 1 / 0.5 = 2. So, the radius is 2, which confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the equation is x² + y² = 4.I think that's consistent. So, the trajectory of point P is the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin."},{"question":"Solve the following equations using appropriate methods:<br/>(1) x(x+2)=-3(x+2);<br/>(2) (2y-1)^{2}-5=0;<br/>(3) (x-3)(x-1)=5;<br/>(4) (x-2)^{2}-7(x-2)=18.","answer":"Okay, so I've got these four equations to solve. Let me take them one by one and see how I can approach each. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of solving quadratic equations, but I'll give it my best shot.Starting with the first equation: ( x(x + 2) = -3(x + 2) ). Hmm, this looks like it might be factorable. Let me see. If I move all terms to one side, that might help. So, I'll add ( 3(x + 2) ) to both sides to get rid of the negative sign on the right. That gives me:( x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0 )Now, I notice that both terms on the left have a common factor of ( (x + 2) ). So, I can factor that out:( (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 )Alright, so now I have a product of two factors equal to zero. That means either one of the factors can be zero. So, setting each factor equal to zero:1. ( x + 2 = 0 ) leads to ( x = -2 )2. ( x + 3 = 0 ) leads to ( x = -3 )Okay, so for the first equation, the solutions are ( x = -2 ) and ( x = -3 ). That wasn't too bad. I think I got that.Moving on to the second equation: ( (2y - 1)^2 - 5 = 0 ). This looks like a quadratic in terms of ( (2y - 1) ). Maybe I can solve for ( (2y - 1) ) first. Let me isolate the squared term:( (2y - 1)^2 = 5 )Now, to solve for ( 2y - 1 ), I'll take the square root of both sides. Remembering that taking a square root introduces both a positive and negative solution:( 2y - 1 = pm sqrt{5} )Now, I'll solve for ( y ) by adding 1 to both sides and then dividing by 2:1. ( 2y - 1 = sqrt{5} ) leads to ( 2y = 1 + sqrt{5} ) and then ( y = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} )2. ( 2y - 1 = -sqrt{5} ) leads to ( 2y = 1 - sqrt{5} ) and then ( y = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} )So, the solutions for the second equation are ( y = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( y = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ). That makes sense, I think.Now, the third equation: ( (x - 3)(x - 1) = 5 ). This looks like a product of two binomials equals 5. I think I need to expand the left side first and then bring the 5 to the left to form a standard quadratic equation.Expanding ( (x - 3)(x - 1) ):( x cdot x + x cdot (-1) + (-3) cdot x + (-3) cdot (-1) )= ( x^2 - x - 3x + 3 )= ( x^2 - 4x + 3 )So, the equation becomes:( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 5 )Subtracting 5 from both sides to set the equation to zero:( x^2 - 4x + 3 - 5 = 0 )= ( x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 )Hmm, this is a quadratic equation that doesn't factor nicely, I think. Maybe I can complete the square or use the quadratic formula. Let me try completing the square.Starting with ( x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 ), I'll move the constant term to the other side:( x^2 - 4x = 2 )To complete the square, I need to add ( (frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4 ) to both sides:( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 2 + 4 )= ( (x - 2)^2 = 6 )Taking the square root of both sides:( x - 2 = pm sqrt{6} )So, solving for ( x ):1. ( x - 2 = sqrt{6} ) leads to ( x = 2 + sqrt{6} )2. ( x - 2 = -sqrt{6} ) leads to ( x = 2 - sqrt{6} )Alright, so the solutions for the third equation are ( x = 2 + sqrt{6} ) and ( x = 2 - sqrt{6} ). That seems right.Finally, the fourth equation: ( (x - 2)^2 - 7(x - 2) = 18 ). This looks a bit more complicated, but maybe I can factor it or make a substitution. Let me see.Let me rewrite the equation:( (x - 2)^2 - 7(x - 2) - 18 = 0 )Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of ( (x - 2) ). Let me make a substitution to make it clearer. Let ( u = x - 2 ). Then the equation becomes:( u^2 - 7u - 18 = 0 )Now, I can try to factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Let's see:Factors of -18:- 1 and -18 (sum -17)- 2 and -9 (sum -7)Yes, 2 and -9 work because 2 * (-9) = -18 and 2 + (-9) = -7.So, factoring:( (u + 2)(u - 9) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero:1. ( u + 2 = 0 ) leads to ( u = -2 )2. ( u - 9 = 0 ) leads to ( u = 9 )But remember, ( u = x - 2 ). So, substituting back:1. ( x - 2 = -2 ) leads to ( x = 0 )2. ( x - 2 = 9 ) leads to ( x = 11 )So, the solutions for the fourth equation are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 11 ). That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check the fourth equation. I made a substitution and factored, but let me verify if plugging these solutions back into the original equation works.For ( x = 0 ):( (0 - 2)^2 - 7(0 - 2) = (-2)^2 - 7(-2) = 4 + 14 = 18 ), which matches the right side.For ( x = 11 ):( (11 - 2)^2 - 7(11 - 2) = (9)^2 - 7(9) = 81 - 63 = 18 ), which also matches.Okay, so both solutions are correct.Overall, I think I handled each equation appropriately. The first one was factorable, the second was a simple square root, the third required completing the square, and the fourth was a quadratic in disguise that needed substitution and factoring. I feel more confident now about solving these types of equations."},{"question":"Prove that the number of partitions of a set, denoted by (S(n, k)), satisfies the recurrence relation (S(n+1, k) = S(n, k-1) + k cdot S(n, k)) for (1 leq k leq n).

Then, I have to use this relation to calculate ( S(5, 3) ).First, I remember that ( S(n, k) ) represents the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of ( n ) elements into ( k ) non-empty subsets. I think the recurrence relation makes sense because when you add an element to the set, there are two possibilities: either the new element forms its own subset or it joins one of the existing subsets.Let me try to break it down step by step.**Understanding the Recurrence Relation:**1. **Case 1: The new element forms its own subset.**   - If I have a set of ( n+1 ) elements, and I want to partition it into ( k ) subsets, one way is to have the new element, say ( x_{n+1} ), form its own subset. Then, the remaining ( n ) elements need to be partitioned into ( k-1 ) subsets. The number of ways to do this is ( S(n, k-1) ).2. **Case 2: The new element joins one of the existing subsets.**   - Alternatively, the new element ( x_{n+1} ) can be added to one of the ( k ) subsets of a partition of the original ( n ) elements. The number of ways to partition the original ( n ) elements into ( k ) subsets is ( S(n, k) ). Since there are ( k ) subsets to choose from for adding ( x_{n+1} ), this gives ( k cdot S(n, k) ) ways.Adding both cases together, we get the recurrence relation:[ S(n+1, k) = S(n, k-1) + k cdot S(n, k) ]That seems to make sense. Now, I need to use this recurrence relation to calculate ( S(5, 3) ).**Calculating ( S(5, 3) ):**I know that to compute ( S(5, 3) ), I need to use the recurrence relation and build up the values step by step. I might need some base cases to start with.**Base Cases:**- ( S(n, 1) = 1 ) for any ( n ), because there's only one way to put all elements into a single subset.- ( S(n, n) = 1 ) for any ( n ), because each element must be in its own subset.- ( S(n, 0) = 0 ) for ( n > 0 ), and ( S(0, 0) = 1 ), but these might not be directly relevant here.I think I also remember that ( S(n, k) = 0 ) if ( k > n ), which is consistent with the definition.Let me try to compute the necessary values step by step.First, I need ( S(4, 2) ) and ( S(4, 3) ) because ( S(5, 3) = S(4, 2) + 3 cdot S(4, 3) ).**Computing ( S(4, 2) ):**Using the recurrence relation:[ S(4, 2) = S(3, 1) + 2 cdot S(3, 2) ]I need ( S(3, 1) ) and ( S(3, 2) ).- ( S(3, 1) = 1 ) (base case)- ( S(3, 2) ): Let's compute this using the recurrence relation as well.  [ S(3, 2) = S(2, 1) + 2 cdot S(2, 2) ]  - ( S(2, 1) = 1 )  - ( S(2, 2) = 1 )  So, ( S(3, 2) = 1 + 2 cdot 1 = 3 )Now, back to ( S(4, 2) ):[ S(4, 2) = 1 + 2 cdot 3 = 1 + 6 = 7 ]**Computing ( S(4, 3) ):**Using the recurrence relation:[ S(4, 3) = S(3, 2) + 3 cdot S(3, 3) ]I already know ( S(3, 2) = 3 ) and ( S(3, 3) = 1 ).So,[ S(4, 3) = 3 + 3 cdot 1 = 3 + 3 = 6 ]**Now, back to ( S(5, 3) ):**[ S(5, 3) = S(4, 2) + 3 cdot S(4, 3) = 7 + 3 cdot 6 = 7 + 18 = 25 ]Wait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.- ( S(3, 2) = 3 ): That seems correct because there are 3 ways to partition 3 elements into 2 subsets.- ( S(4, 2) = 7 ): Hmm, I think that's right. The number of ways to partition 4 elements into 2 subsets is indeed 7.- ( S(4, 3) = 6 ): That also seems correct. There are 6 ways to partition 4 elements into 3 subsets.- Finally, ( S(5, 3) = 25 ): I think that's the correct value.I can also recall that ( S(5, 3) ) is a known value, and I believe it is indeed 25. So, my calculations seem consistent.**Summary of Steps:**1. Proved the recurrence relation by considering two cases: the new element forming its own subset or joining an existing subset.2. Used the recurrence relation to compute ( S(5, 3) ) by first finding ( S(4, 2) ) and ( S(4, 3) ).3. Verified the intermediate steps to ensure accuracy.I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work along the way.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\\"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, if a₃ + a₅ + a₇ + a₉ + a₁₁ = 100, then the value of 3a₉ - a₁₃ is ( ) A: 20 B: 30 C: 40 D: 50\\"Alright, so first, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference, which we usually denote as 'd'. So, the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be written as:a_n = a₁ + (n - 1)dWhere a₁ is the first term and d is the common difference.Now, the problem gives me the sum of five specific terms: a₃, a₅, a₇, a₉, and a₁₁. Their sum is 100. I need to find the value of 3a₉ - a₁₃.Hmm, okay. Let me write down the expressions for each of these terms using the formula for the nth term.a₃ = a₁ + 2da₅ = a₁ + 4da₇ = a₁ + 6da₉ = a₁ + 8da₁₁ = a₁ + 10dSo, if I add all these up:a₃ + a₅ + a₇ + a₉ + a₁₁ = (a₁ + 2d) + (a₁ + 4d) + (a₁ + 6d) + (a₁ + 8d) + (a₁ + 10d)Let me simplify this expression. Combine like terms:Number of a₁ terms: 5a₁Number of d terms: 2d + 4d + 6d + 8d + 10dLet me add those d terms:2d + 4d = 6d6d + 6d = 12d12d + 8d = 20d20d + 10d = 30dSo, altogether, the sum is 5a₁ + 30d = 100.So, 5a₁ + 30d = 100.I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:a₁ + 6d = 20Wait, that's interesting. Because a₁ + 6d is actually the 7th term of the sequence, right? Because a₇ = a₁ + 6d.So, a₇ = 20.That's a useful piece of information. So, the 7th term is 20.Now, the problem asks for 3a₉ - a₁₃.Let me write expressions for a₉ and a₁₃.a₉ = a₁ + 8da₁₃ = a₁ + 12dSo, 3a₉ - a₁₃ = 3(a₁ + 8d) - (a₁ + 12d)Let me expand this:= 3a₁ + 24d - a₁ - 12dCombine like terms:3a₁ - a₁ = 2a₁24d - 12d = 12dSo, 3a₉ - a₁₃ = 2a₁ + 12dHmm, can I factor this expression?Yes, 2a₁ + 12d can be written as 2(a₁ + 6d)But wait, earlier I found that a₁ + 6d = 20. So, substituting that in:2(a₁ + 6d) = 2 * 20 = 40So, 3a₉ - a₁₃ = 40.Looking back at the options, C is 40. So, the answer should be C: 40.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the sum:a₃ + a₅ + a₇ + a₉ + a₁₁ = 100Expressed as:5a₁ + 30d = 100Divide by 5:a₁ + 6d = 20Which is a₇ = 20.Then, 3a₉ - a₁₃:a₉ = a₁ + 8da₁₃ = a₁ + 12dSo, 3a₉ = 3a₁ + 24dSubtract a₁₃: 3a₁ + 24d - (a₁ + 12d) = 2a₁ + 12dFactor: 2(a₁ + 6d) = 2*20 = 40Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 40, which is option C.But wait, the initial assistant answer was D:50. Did I do something wrong?Let me check again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recount the sum:a₃ + a₅ + a₇ + a₉ + a₁₁Which is:(a₁ + 2d) + (a₁ + 4d) + (a₁ + 6d) + (a₁ + 8d) + (a₁ + 10d)So, that's 5a₁ + (2d + 4d + 6d + 8d + 10d) = 5a₁ + 30d = 100Divide by 5: a₁ + 6d = 20, which is a₇ = 20.Then, 3a₉ - a₁₃:a₉ = a₁ + 8da₁₃ = a₁ + 12dSo, 3a₉ = 3a₁ + 24dSubtract a₁₃: 3a₁ +24d - a₁ -12d = 2a₁ +12dWhich is 2(a₁ +6d) = 2*20=40Hmm, so I think my calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 40, which is option C.But the initial assistant answer was D:50. Maybe the assistant made a mistake? Or perhaps I misread the problem.Wait, let me check the problem again:\\"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, if a₃ + a₅ + a₇ + a₉ + a₁₁ = 100, then the value of 3a₉ - a₁₃ is ( ) A:20 B:30 C:40 D:50\\"No, the problem is as I read it. So, perhaps the initial assistant answer was wrong.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.Wait, another approach: Maybe instead of calculating 3a₉ - a₁₃ directly, I can express it in terms of a₇.Since a₇ = 20.Let me see:a₉ is two terms after a₇, so a₉ = a₇ + 2d = 20 + 2dSimilarly, a₁₃ is six terms after a₇, so a₁₃ = a₇ + 6d = 20 + 6dSo, 3a₉ - a₁₃ = 3*(20 + 2d) - (20 + 6d)= 60 + 6d -20 -6d= 40Same result. So, 40 is correct.Therefore, the correct answer is C:40.So, I think the initial assistant answer was wrong, perhaps a typo or miscalculation.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Determine the type of curve defined by the equation[ r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta}. ](A) Line(B) Circle(C) Parabola(D) Ellipse(E) HyperbolaChoose the correct option.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation in polar coordinates: ( r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ). I need to figure out what kind of curve this represents. The options are Line, Circle, Parabola, Ellipse, or Hyperbola. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that polar equations can often be converted to Cartesian coordinates to make them easier to identify. The basic relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are ( x = r cos theta ) and ( y = r sin theta ). Maybe I can use these to rewrite the given equation.Starting with the given equation:[ r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ]I can rewrite the denominator using the Cartesian relationships. Since ( sin theta = frac{y}{r} ) and ( cos theta = frac{x}{r} ), substituting these into the equation gives:[ r = frac{1}{frac{y}{r} + frac{x}{r}} ]Simplifying the denominator:[ r = frac{1}{frac{x + y}{r}} ]Which is the same as:[ r = frac{r}{x + y} ]Hmm, if I multiply both sides by ( x + y ), I get:[ r(x + y) = r ]Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my steps again. Starting from:[ r = frac{1}{frac{x + y}{r}} ]This simplifies to:[ r = frac{r}{x + y} ]If I multiply both sides by ( x + y ), it should be:[ r(x + y) = r ]But then, if I divide both sides by ( r ) (assuming ( r neq 0 )), I get:[ x + y = 1 ]Oh, that's interesting. So, the equation simplifies to ( x + y = 1 ), which is a linear equation in Cartesian coordinates. That would represent a straight line. But wait, the options include a Circle, which was the initial thought, but now I'm getting a line.Let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake. Starting again:Given:[ r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ]Express ( sin theta ) and ( cos theta ) in terms of ( x ) and ( y ):[ sin theta = frac{y}{r} ][ cos theta = frac{x}{r} ]So, substituting:[ r = frac{1}{frac{y}{r} + frac{x}{r}} = frac{1}{frac{x + y}{r}} = frac{r}{x + y} ]So, multiplying both sides by ( x + y ):[ r(x + y) = r ]Subtract ( r ) from both sides:[ r(x + y) - r = 0 ][ r(x + y - 1) = 0 ]Since ( r ) is not always zero (except at the origin, which isn't part of this curve), we can divide both sides by ( r ):[ x + y - 1 = 0 ][ x + y = 1 ]So, this is indeed a straight line in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, the curve is a line. But wait, the initial thought was a circle. Maybe I missed something.Alternatively, perhaps I should square both sides to eliminate ( r ). Let me try that approach.Starting again:[ r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ]Multiply both sides by ( sin theta + cos theta ):[ r(sin theta + cos theta) = 1 ]Expressing ( r sin theta ) as ( y ) and ( r cos theta ) as ( x ):[ y + x = 1 ]So, again, I get ( x + y = 1 ), which is a straight line. Hmm, so why did I initially think it was a circle?Maybe I confused this with another equation. Let me think about the general form of a circle in polar coordinates. A circle can be represented as ( r = frac{e}{1 + e sin theta} ) or something similar, depending on its position. But in this case, the equation simplifies directly to a linear equation.Wait, perhaps I should consider if this line is a special case or if there's an alternative interpretation. For example, in polar coordinates, sometimes equations can represent lines or circles depending on the coefficients.Let me recall that the general equation of a line in polar coordinates is ( r = frac{ep}{1 + e sin theta} ) or ( r = frac{ep}{1 + e cos theta} ), where ( e = 1 ) for a parabola, but here the denominator is just ( sin theta + cos theta ), not ( 1 + e sin theta ) or similar.Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation in terms of ( r ) and then square both sides to see if it forms a circle.Starting from:[ r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ]Multiply both sides by ( sin theta + cos theta ):[ r sin theta + r cos theta = 1 ]Which is:[ y + x = 1 ]So, again, it's a straight line. Therefore, the curve is a line.But wait, the initial thought was a circle because when I converted it, I thought I got a circle equation, but now I see that it's actually a line. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial conversion.Let me try another approach. Let's express ( sin theta + cos theta ) as ( sqrt{2} sin(theta + 45^circ) ) using the sine addition formula. So, ( sin theta + cos theta = sqrt{2} sin(theta + 45^circ) ).Substituting back into the equation:[ r = frac{1}{sqrt{2} sin(theta + 45^circ)} ]This resembles the polar equation of a line, which is ( r = frac{ep}{1 + e sin(theta - alpha)} ), where ( e = 1 ) for a parabola, but here it's different. Wait, actually, the standard form for a line in polar coordinates is ( r = frac{d}{1 + e cos(theta - phi)} ), where ( d ) is the distance from the origin to the line, and ( phi ) is the angle of the normal to the line.But in our case, it's ( r = frac{1}{sqrt{2} sin(theta + 45^circ)} ), which can be rewritten as:[ r = frac{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}}{sin(theta + 45^circ)} ]This is similar to the equation of a line in polar coordinates, where the denominator is just ( sin(theta + alpha) ), indicating a line at a distance ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) from the origin, making an angle of ( -45^circ ) with the polar axis.Therefore, this confirms that the curve is a straight line.Wait, but earlier when I converted it directly, I also got ( x + y = 1 ), which is a line. So, both methods confirm that it's a line. Therefore, the correct answer should be (A) Line.But I'm a bit confused because initially, I thought it might be a circle, but after careful conversion, it's clearly a line. Maybe I was overcomplicating it by trying to complete the square or something, but in reality, it's straightforward.Let me just recap:Given ( r = frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} ), converting to Cartesian coordinates by substituting ( x = r cos theta ) and ( y = r sin theta ) leads directly to ( x + y = 1 ), which is a straight line. Therefore, the curve is a line.I think I was initially confused because sometimes polar equations can represent circles, but in this case, it's a line. So, the answer should be (A) Line."},{"question":"What is the value of the expression (x^{2000} + x^{1999} + x^{1998} + 1000x^{1000} + 1000x^{999} + 1000x^{998} + 2000x^{3} + 2000x^{2} + 2000x + 3000) (where (x) is a real number), if (x^{2} + x + 1 = 0)? Vasya calculated the answer to be 3000. Is Vasya correct?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate a big expression: (x^{2000} + x^{1999} + x^{1998} + 1000x^{1000} + 1000x^{999} + 1000x^{998} + 2000x^3 + 2000x^2 + 2000x + 3000). And I know that (x) is a real number that satisfies the equation (x^2 + x + 1 = 0). Hmm, okay, so first, I need to figure out what (x) is.Let me start by solving (x^2 + x + 1 = 0). I remember that for a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), the solutions are given by the quadratic formula: (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}). Plugging in the values from my equation, (a = 1), (b = 1), and (c = 1), so:(x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 1})Calculating the discriminant: (1 - 4 = -3). Oh, so the discriminant is negative, which means the roots are complex numbers. So, (x = frac{-1 pm isqrt{3}}{2}). These are the complex roots. But wait, the problem says (x) is a real number. That's confusing because the roots of this equation are complex, not real. Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again.Wait, the problem says (x) is a real number, but (x^2 + x + 1 = 0) has no real solutions because the discriminant is negative. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a typo or I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to work with complex numbers despite (x) being called a real number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should proceed assuming (x) is complex, even though it's stated as real. Or perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the expression simplifies regardless of the nature of (x).Let me think. If (x^2 + x + 1 = 0), then (x^3 = 1). Wait, how? Let me see:Starting from (x^2 + x + 1 = 0), multiply both sides by (x - 1):((x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = x^3 - 1 = 0)So, (x^3 = 1). That means (x) is a cube root of unity. But since (x^2 + x + 1 = 0), (x) is a primitive cube root of unity, not equal to 1. So, (x^3 = 1), which is a key property. This could help simplify the exponents in the expression.Given that (x^3 = 1), any exponent can be reduced modulo 3. For example, (x^{2000} = x^{3 cdot 666 + 2} = (x^3)^{666} cdot x^2 = 1^{666} cdot x^2 = x^2). Similarly, (x^{1999} = x^{3 cdot 666 + 1} = x), and (x^{1998} = x^{3 cdot 666} = 1).Let me apply this to each term in the expression:1. (x^{2000} = x^2)2. (x^{1999} = x)3. (x^{1998} = 1)4. (1000x^{1000} = 1000x^{3 cdot 333 + 1} = 1000x)5. (1000x^{999} = 1000x^{3 cdot 333} = 1000 cdot 1 = 1000)6. (1000x^{998} = 1000x^{3 cdot 332 + 2} = 1000x^2)7. (2000x^3 = 2000 cdot 1 = 2000)8. (2000x^2 = 2000x^2)9. (2000x = 2000x)10. (3000) remains as is.Now, let's substitute all these back into the original expression:(x^2 + x + 1 + 1000x + 1000 + 1000x^2 + 2000 + 2000x^2 + 2000x + 3000)Now, let's combine like terms:- Terms with (x^2): (x^2 + 1000x^2 + 2000x^2 = (1 + 1000 + 2000)x^2 = 3001x^2)- Terms with (x): (x + 1000x + 2000x = (1 + 1000 + 2000)x = 3001x)- Constant terms: (1 + 1000 + 2000 + 3000 = 6001)So, the expression simplifies to:(3001x^2 + 3001x + 6001)But wait, from the original equation (x^2 + x + 1 = 0), we can express (x^2 = -x - 1). Let's substitute (x^2) in the expression:(3001(-x - 1) + 3001x + 6001)Expanding this:(-3001x - 3001 + 3001x + 6001)The (x) terms cancel out:(-3001x + 3001x = 0)So, we're left with:(-3001 + 6001 = 3000)Therefore, the value of the expression is 3000. So, Vasya was correct.Wait, but earlier I was confused because the roots are complex, but the problem states (x) is a real number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps it's a trick question where even though (x) is complex, the expression still evaluates to a real number. In any case, the calculation shows that the expression simplifies to 3000 regardless of the nature of (x), as long as (x^2 + x + 1 = 0)."},{"question":"Given that the derivative of the function f(x) defined on the set of positive real numbers, f'(x), satisfies f'(x) < frac{f(x)}{x}, the inequality that always holds for any x_1, x_2 in (0, +infty) is (quad)A: f(x_1 + x_2) > f(x_1) + f(x_2)B: f(x_1 + x_2) < f(x_1) + f(x_2)C: f(x_1 x_2) > f(x_1) + f(x_2)D: f(x_1 x_2) < f(x_1) + f(x_2)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function f(x) defined on positive real numbers, and its derivative f'(x) satisfies f'(x) < f(x)/x. I need to figure out which inequality always holds for any x₁ and x₂ in (0, +∞). The options are about f(x₁ + x₂) compared to f(x₁) + f(x₂), and f(x₁x₂) compared to f(x₁) + f(x₂). Hmm, let me start by understanding the condition given: f'(x) < f(x)/x. Maybe I can rewrite this to make it more manageable. If I multiply both sides by x, I get x f'(x) < f(x). That looks a bit cleaner. So, x f'(x) - f(x) < 0. Wait, this reminds me of something. If I have a function h(x) = f(x)/x, then maybe I can find its derivative. Let me compute h'(x). Using the quotient rule, h'(x) = [f'(x) * x - f(x)] / x². So, h'(x) = (x f'(x) - f(x)) / x². From the condition given, x f'(x) - f(x) < 0, so h'(x) < 0. That means h(x) is a decreasing function. So, h(x) = f(x)/x is decreasing on (0, +∞). Alright, so h(x) is decreasing. What does that tell me? If I take two points, say x₁ and x₂, with x₁ < x₂, then h(x₁) > h(x₂). So, f(x₁)/x₁ > f(x₂)/x₂. I need to relate this to the options given. Let's look at options A and B first, which involve f(x₁ + x₂). So, maybe I can consider x = x₁ + x₂ and compare h(x) with h(x₂). Since h is decreasing, if x₁ + x₂ > x₂, then h(x₁ + x₂) < h(x₂). So, h(x₁ + x₂) = f(x₁ + x₂)/(x₁ + x₂) < h(x₂) = f(x₂)/x₂. Multiplying both sides by (x₁ + x₂), I get f(x₁ + x₂) < (x₁ + x₂) * f(x₂)/x₂. Simplifying the right side, that's f(x₂) + (x₁/x₂) * f(x₂). Hmm, but I don't know if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can relate it to f(x₁). Since h(x) is decreasing, h(x₁) > h(x₁ + x₂). So, f(x₁)/x₁ > f(x₁ + x₂)/(x₁ + x₂). Multiplying both sides by x₁, I get f(x₁) > x₁ * f(x₁ + x₂)/(x₁ + x₂). Rearranging, f(x₁ + x₂) < (x₁ + x₂)/x₁ * f(x₁). Wait, that gives me f(x₁ + x₂) < (1 + x₂/x₁) * f(x₁). But I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Maybe I need another approach. Let me think about the function h(x) = f(x)/x being decreasing. So, for any x > 0, h(x) is decreasing. That means if I take x₁ and x₂, and suppose x₁ < x₂, then h(x₁) > h(x₂). But how does that relate to f(x₁ + x₂)? Maybe I can consider the function at x₁ + x₂ and compare it to the function at x₂. Since x₁ + x₂ > x₂, h(x₁ + x₂) < h(x₂). So, f(x₁ + x₂)/(x₁ + x₂) < f(x₂)/x₂. Multiplying both sides by (x₁ + x₂), I get f(x₁ + x₂) < (x₁ + x₂) * f(x₂)/x₂ = f(x₂) + x₁ * f(x₂)/x₂. Hmm, but I need to relate this to f(x₁) + f(x₂). Since h(x) is decreasing, h(x₁) > h(x₂), so f(x₁)/x₁ > f(x₂)/x₂. That implies f(x₁) > (x₁/x₂) f(x₂). So, x₁ * f(x₂)/x₂ < f(x₁). Therefore, f(x₁ + x₂) < f(x₂) + x₁ * f(x₂)/x₂ < f(x₂) + f(x₁). So, f(x₁ + x₂) < f(x₁) + f(x₂). That would mean option B is correct. Wait, let me double-check. If h(x) is decreasing, then for x₁ < x₂, h(x₁) > h(x₂). So, f(x₁)/x₁ > f(x₂)/x₂. If I take x = x₁ + x₂, which is greater than x₂, then h(x₁ + x₂) < h(x₂). So, f(x₁ + x₂)/(x₁ + x₂) < f(x₂)/x₂. Multiplying both sides by (x₁ + x₂), f(x₁ + x₂) < (x₁ + x₂) * f(x₂)/x₂ = f(x₂) + x₁ * f(x₂)/x₂. Since f(x₁)/x₁ > f(x₂)/x₂, then x₁ * f(x₂)/x₂ < f(x₁). So, f(x₁ + x₂) < f(x₂) + f(x₁). Yes, that seems to hold. So, option B is correct. What about the other options? Option A is the opposite, so it's not correct. Options C and D involve f(x₁x₂). Let me think about that. If I consider h(x) = f(x)/x decreasing, then for x₁x₂, if x₁x₂ > x₁, then h(x₁x₂) < h(x₁). So, f(x₁x₂)/(x₁x₂) < f(x₁)/x₁. Multiplying both sides by x₁x₂, f(x₁x₂) < x₂ * f(x₁). Similarly, f(x₁x₂) < x₁ * f(x₂). But I don't know if that directly relates to f(x₁) + f(x₂). It might not necessarily be less than or greater than f(x₁) + f(x₂). So, I'm not sure about options C and D. But since I already have a solid argument for option B, I think that's the correct one. **Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1){(sqrt{2})}^{2}+|sqrt{2}-2|-{(π-1)}^{0};<br/>(2)sqrt[3]{27}+sqrt{{(-2)}^{2}}-sqrt{{3}^{2}}.","answer":"Alright, let's tackle these two math problems step by step. I'm going to take my time to understand each part of the expressions and make sure I apply the correct mathematical rules.**Problem 1: Calculate ((sqrt{2})^{2} + |sqrt{2} - 2| - (pi - 1)^{0}).**Okay, so I have three parts here: ((sqrt{2})^{2}), (|sqrt{2} - 2|), and ((pi - 1)^{0}). Let's break them down one by one.First, ((sqrt{2})^{2}). I know that squaring a square root should give me back the original number inside the square root, right? So, ((sqrt{2})^{2}) should just be 2. That seems straightforward.Next, (|sqrt{2} - 2|). Absolute value means the distance from zero on the number line, so it's always positive or zero. I need to figure out if (sqrt{2} - 2) is positive or negative. I remember that (sqrt{2}) is approximately 1.414, so subtracting 2 would give me about -0.586. Since that's negative, the absolute value would make it positive, so (|sqrt{2} - 2| = 2 - sqrt{2}).Lastly, ((pi - 1)^{0}). Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Since (pi) is approximately 3.1416, (pi - 1) is about 2.1416, which is definitely not zero. So, ((pi - 1)^{0} = 1).Now, putting it all together:[(sqrt{2})^{2} + |sqrt{2} - 2| - (pi - 1)^{0} = 2 + (2 - sqrt{2}) - 1]Simplifying that:[2 + 2 - sqrt{2} - 1 = (2 + 2 - 1) - sqrt{2} = 3 - sqrt{2}]Okay, that makes sense. So the result for the first problem is (3 - sqrt{2}).**Problem 2: Calculate (sqrt[3]{27} + sqrt{(-2)^{2}} - sqrt{3^{2}}).**Again, I'll break this down into parts: (sqrt[3]{27}), (sqrt{(-2)^{2}}), and (sqrt{3^{2}}).Starting with (sqrt[3]{27}). The cube root of 27 is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27. I know that (3 times 3 times 3 = 27), so (sqrt[3]{27} = 3).Next, (sqrt{(-2)^{2}}). First, I need to compute ((-2)^{2}). Squaring a negative number gives a positive result, so ((-2)^{2} = 4). Then, taking the square root of 4, which is 2. So, (sqrt{(-2)^{2}} = 2).Lastly, (sqrt{3^{2}}). Squaring 3 gives 9, and the square root of 9 is 3. So, (sqrt{3^{2}} = 3).Now, putting it all together:[sqrt[3]{27} + sqrt{(-2)^{2}} - sqrt{3^{2}} = 3 + 2 - 3]Simplifying that:[3 + 2 - 3 = (3 - 3) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2]So, the result for the second problem is 2.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For Problem 1:- ((sqrt{2})^{2} = 2)- (|sqrt{2} - 2| = 2 - sqrt{2}) because (sqrt{2} < 2)- ((pi - 1)^{0} = 1)Adding them up: (2 + (2 - sqrt{2}) - 1 = 3 - sqrt{2}). Yep, that looks correct.For Problem 2:- (sqrt[3]{27} = 3)- (sqrt{(-2)^{2}} = sqrt{4} = 2)- (sqrt{3^{2}} = sqrt{9} = 3)Adding them up: (3 + 2 - 3 = 2). That also seems right.I think I've got both problems solved correctly."},{"question":"Let k be the scale factor of similarity transformation centered at the origin. Is it true that the point A belongs to the image of plane a?A(0, 3, -1)a: 2x - y + 3z - 1 = 0k = 2","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about similarity transformations and whether a specific point lies on the image of a plane after the transformation. Let me try to understand what's being asked and figure out how to approach it.First, the problem states: Let ( k ) be the scale factor of a similarity transformation centered at the origin. We need to determine if the point ( A(0, 3, -1) ) belongs to the image of the plane ( a ) after the transformation. The plane ( a ) is given by the equation ( 2x - y + 3z - 1 = 0 ), and the scale factor ( k ) is 2.Okay, so similarity transformations involve scaling, rotation, and possibly reflection, but since it's centered at the origin, I think it's just scaling and rotation. However, the problem doesn't mention rotation, so maybe it's just a scaling transformation. That simplifies things a bit.I remember that a similarity transformation with scale factor ( k ) centered at the origin transforms any point ( (x, y, z) ) to ( (kx, ky, kz) ). So, if we apply this transformation to the plane ( a ), we need to see what the equation of the transformed plane becomes and then check if point ( A ) lies on this new plane.Let me recall how transformations affect planes. If we have a plane ( Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 ) and we apply a scaling transformation with factor ( k ), the new plane equation becomes ( Aleft(frac{x}{k}right) + Bleft(frac{y}{k}right) + Cleft(frac{z}{k}right) + D = 0 ). Wait, is that right? Or is it the other way around?Actually, when you scale the coordinates by ( k ), the inverse happens to the plane equation. So, if a point ( (x, y, z) ) is scaled to ( (kx, ky, kz) ), then the original plane equation ( Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 ) becomes ( Aleft(frac{x}{k}right) + Bleft(frac{y}{k}right) + Cleft(frac{z}{k}right) + D = 0 ) for the transformed plane. To make it cleaner, we can multiply both sides by ( k ) to eliminate the denominators:( Ax + By + Cz + kD = 0 ).So, the transformed plane equation is ( Ax + By + Cz + kD = 0 ).Given that, let's apply this to our specific plane ( a: 2x - y + 3z - 1 = 0 ) with ( k = 2 ). The transformed plane ( a' ) should be:( 2x - y + 3z + (2)(-1) = 0 )Simplifying that:( 2x - y + 3z - 2 = 0 )Okay, so the transformed plane ( a' ) has the equation ( 2x - y + 3z - 2 = 0 ).Now, we need to check if the point ( A(0, 3, -1) ) lies on this transformed plane. To do that, we substitute the coordinates of point ( A ) into the equation of plane ( a' ) and see if the equation holds true.Substituting ( x = 0 ), ( y = 3 ), and ( z = -1 ) into ( 2x - y + 3z - 2 ):( 2(0) - 3 + 3(-1) - 2 )Calculating step by step:- ( 2(0) = 0 )- ( -3 ) remains as is.- ( 3(-1) = -3 )- ( -2 ) remains as is.Adding them up:( 0 - 3 - 3 - 2 = -8 )So, the left-hand side of the equation evaluates to ( -8 ), which is not equal to 0. Therefore, point ( A ) does not lie on the transformed plane ( a' ).Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I got the transformation backwards or messed up the substitution.Starting again, the original plane is ( 2x - y + 3z - 1 = 0 ). After scaling by ( k = 2 ), the transformed plane should be ( 2x - y + 3z - 2 = 0 ). That seems correct because we're scaling the constant term by ( k ).Substituting ( A(0, 3, -1) ):( 2(0) - 3 + 3(-1) - 2 = 0 - 3 - 3 - 2 = -8 ). Yep, that's definitely not zero.So, my conclusion is that point ( A ) does not lie on the image of plane ( a ) after the similarity transformation with scale factor ( k = 2 ).Just to be thorough, let me think about what this transformation actually does. Scaling by 2 centered at the origin means every point is moved twice as far from the origin. So, the plane ( a ) is scaled away from the origin by a factor of 2. The original plane was ( 2x - y + 3z - 1 = 0 ), and after scaling, it becomes ( 2x - y + 3z - 2 = 0 ). The distance from the origin to the plane increases, which makes sense because scaling away from the origin would move the plane further out.Point ( A ) is at ( (0, 3, -1) ). If I were to scale this point by ( k = 2 ), it would become ( (0, 6, -2) ). But we're not scaling the point; we're scaling the plane. So, the question is whether the original point ( A ) lies on the scaled plane. Since it doesn't, as we saw earlier, the answer is no.Another way to think about it is to consider the inverse transformation. If we wanted to see if ( A ) is on the transformed plane, we could also consider if the pre-image of ( A ) under the scaling transformation lies on the original plane. The pre-image of ( A ) would be ( (0/2, 3/2, -1/2) = (0, 1.5, -0.5) ). Plugging this into the original plane equation:( 2(0) - 1.5 + 3(-0.5) - 1 = 0 - 1.5 - 1.5 - 1 = -4 ), which is not zero. So, the pre-image doesn't lie on the original plane either, confirming that ( A ) doesn't lie on the transformed plane.I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the point ( A ) does not belong to the image of plane ( a ) after the similarity transformation with scale factor ( k = 2 ).**Final Answer**boxed{text{No}}"},{"question":"How many subsets, P, are there such that {1} subsetneq P subseteq {1, 2, 3}?A: 2B: 3C: 4D: 5","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: \\"How many subsets, P, are there such that {1} is a proper subset of P, and P is a subset of {1, 2, 3}?\\" The options are A: 2, B: 3, C: 4, D: 5.Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for {1} to be a proper subset of P. A proper subset means that {1} is contained within P, but P is not equal to {1}. So, P must have at least the element 1, and it must have at least one more element from the set {1, 2, 3}.So, P has to be a subset of {1, 2, 3}, which means P can only contain elements from this set. But since {1} is a proper subset of P, P can't just be {1}; it has to include at least one more element.Let me list all possible subsets of {1, 2, 3} that include 1 and at least one other element. The subsets of {1, 2, 3} are:1. {}2. {1}3. {2}4. {3}5. {1, 2}6. {1, 3}7. {2, 3}8. {1, 2, 3}But we need subsets P where {1} is a proper subset of P. So, P must contain 1 and at least one more element. That means we can exclude the subsets that don't contain 1 or contain only 1.So, excluding {} (doesn't contain 1), {1} (since P must be a proper superset, not equal), {2}, and {3} (they don't contain 1). That leaves us with:5. {1, 2}6. {1, 3}7. {2, 3} – wait, {2, 3} doesn't contain 1, so we should exclude that too.8. {1, 2, 3}So, actually, only {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {1, 2, 3} are the subsets that contain 1 and at least one more element. That makes three subsets.Wait, but hold on. Did I miss any? Let me double-check. The subsets that include 1 and at least one more element are:- {1, 2}- {1, 3}- {1, 2, 3}Yes, that's three subsets. So, the answer should be 3, which is option B.But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let's think about it another way. The total number of subsets of {1, 2, 3} is 8, as I listed before. The number of subsets that contain 1 is equal to the number of subsets of {2, 3}, which is 4 (since for each element, you can choose to include or exclude it). So, subsets containing 1 are:- {1}- {1, 2}- {1, 3}- {1, 2, 3}Out of these, we need to exclude {1} because P must be a proper superset of {1}, meaning it can't be equal to {1}. So, that leaves us with three subsets: {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {1, 2, 3}.Therefore, the correct answer is 3, which is option B."},{"question":"Given |z_{1}|=3, |z_{2}|=4, |z_{1}+z_{2}|=5, find |z_{1}-z_{2}|.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about complex numbers. It says that the magnitude of z₁ is 3, the magnitude of z₂ is 4, and the magnitude of z₁ plus z₂ is 5. I need to find the magnitude of z₁ minus z₂. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for complex numbers, the magnitude represents the distance from the origin in the complex plane. So, |z₁| = 3 means that z₁ is somewhere on a circle with radius 3 centered at the origin. Similarly, |z₂| = 4 means z₂ is on a circle with radius 4. Now, |z₁ + z₂| = 5 tells me something about the distance between the points z₁ and z₂ when they're added together.I think I can use the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two complex numbers. I recall that |z₁ + z₂|² = |z₁|² + |z₂|² + 2Re(z₁overline{z₂}), where Re denotes the real part. But I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about this. Maybe there's a simpler approach using the law of cosines or something geometric.Let me visualize this. If I think of z₁ and z₂ as vectors in the complex plane, then z₁ + z₂ is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by z₁ and z₂. The lengths of the sides are 3 and 4, and the length of the diagonal is 5. Wait a minute, 3, 4, 5—that's a right triangle! So, does that mean that z₁ and z₂ are perpendicular to each other? Because in a right triangle, the vectors are orthogonal.If that's the case, then the angle between z₁ and z₂ is 90 degrees. Now, if I want to find |z₁ - z₂|, that would be the other diagonal of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. So, if one diagonal is 5, then the other diagonal should satisfy 5² + |z₁ - z₂|² = 2*(3² + 4²).Let me write that down:5² + |z₁ - z₂|² = 2*(3² + 4²)Calculating the left side: 25 + |z₁ - z₂|²Calculating the right side: 2*(9 + 16) = 2*25 = 50So, 25 + |z₁ - z₂|² = 50Subtracting 25 from both sides: |z₁ - z₂|² = 25Taking the square root: |z₁ - z₂| = 5Wait, that's interesting. So, both |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂| are 5? That seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, the diagonals of a parallelogram aren't equal unless it's a rectangle. But in this case, since the sides are 3 and 4, and the diagonals are both 5, it must be a rectangle. But wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, but here we have a parallelogram with sides 3 and 4 and both diagonals equal to 5. That seems possible because 3, 4, 5 is a right triangle, so the parallelogram is actually a rectangle.But hold on, if z₁ and z₂ are perpendicular, then the parallelogram is a rectangle, and both diagonals are equal. So, that makes sense. Therefore, |z₁ - z₂| is also 5.Alternatively, I could approach this algebraically. Let's denote z₁ = a + bi and z₂ = c + di, where a, b, c, d are real numbers. Then, |z₁| = √(a² + b²) = 3, so a² + b² = 9. Similarly, |z₂| = √(c² + d²) = 4, so c² + d² = 16.Given |z₁ + z₂| = 5, which is √((a + c)² + (b + d)²) = 5. Squaring both sides: (a + c)² + (b + d)² = 25.Expanding this: a² + 2ac + c² + b² + 2bd + d² = 25.We know a² + b² = 9 and c² + d² = 16, so substituting these in: 9 + 16 + 2(ac + bd) = 25.Simplifying: 25 + 2(ac + bd) = 25.Subtracting 25: 2(ac + bd) = 0, so ac + bd = 0.Now, to find |z₁ - z₂|, we calculate √((a - c)² + (b - d)²). Squaring this gives (a - c)² + (b - d)².Expanding: a² - 2ac + c² + b² - 2bd + d².Again, substituting a² + b² = 9 and c² + d² = 16: 9 + 16 - 2(ac + bd).But we found earlier that ac + bd = 0, so this becomes 25 - 0 = 25.Taking the square root: √25 = 5.So, |z₁ - z₂| = 5.That confirms my earlier geometric approach. It's interesting how both methods lead to the same conclusion. I guess that's the beauty of mathematics—different approaches converging to the same result.Another way to think about this is using vectors. If z₁ and z₂ are vectors with magnitudes 3 and 4, and their sum has magnitude 5, then they must form a right angle with each other. This is because 3² + 4² = 5², satisfying the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, the angle between them is 90 degrees, making the parallelogram formed by them a rectangle, where both diagonals are equal in length. Hence, both |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂| are 5.I wonder if there's a more straightforward formula or identity that relates |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂| directly without going through all this. Maybe using inner products or something? But I think for this problem, the methods I've used are sufficient and clear.Just to recap:1. Given |z₁| = 3 and |z₂| = 4.2. Given |z₁ + z₂| = 5.3. Using the formula for the magnitude of the sum, we find that the dot product (or the real part of z₁overline{z₂}) is zero, indicating perpendicular vectors.4. Using the parallelogram law, we find that |z₁ - z₂| is also 5.This makes sense because in a rectangle, both diagonals are equal, and since z₁ and z₂ are perpendicular, the figure formed is indeed a rectangle.I think I've covered all the bases here. I've approached it geometrically, algebraically, and even thought about it in terms of vectors. All paths lead to the conclusion that |z₁ - z₂| is 5. I feel confident about this answer now."},{"question":"If (X-2)^8 = a + a_1(x-1) + ldots + a_8(x-1)^8, then the value of left(a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8right)^2 - left(a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7right)^2 is (Answer in digits).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ((X - 2)^8 = a + a_1(x - 1) + ldots + a_8(x - 1)^8), then I need to find the value of (left(a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8right)^2 - left(a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7right)^2). Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that the left side is ((X - 2)^8), which is a polynomial in (X), and the right side is a polynomial in terms of ((x - 1)). So, essentially, they're expressing the same polynomial but in different bases. That makes me think of expanding both sides and comparing coefficients, but that might get messy with all the terms. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.I remember that sometimes plugging in specific values for (x) can help simplify things. Let me try plugging in (x = 1). If I do that, the right side becomes (a + a_1(0) + a_2(0)^2 + ldots + a_8(0)^8 = a). So, the left side when (x = 1) is ((1 - 2)^8 = (-1)^8 = 1). Therefore, (a = 1). Okay, that was straightforward.Next, maybe I can plug in another value for (x) to get more information. How about (x = 2)? Plugging that in, the right side becomes (a + a_1(1) + a_2(1)^2 + ldots + a_8(1)^8 = a + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8). The left side when (x = 2) is ((2 - 2)^8 = 0^8 = 0). So, (a + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8 = 0). Since we already know (a = 1), this simplifies to (1 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8 = 0), which means (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8 = -1).Hmm, that's useful. Now, maybe I can find another equation by plugging in a different value. Let's try (x = 0). On the right side, that would be (a + a_1(-1) + a_2(-1)^2 + ldots + a_8(-1)^8). Simplifying, that's (a - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8). On the left side, ((0 - 2)^8 = (-2)^8 = 256). So, we have (a - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 256). Again, since (a = 1), this becomes (1 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 256), which simplifies to (-a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 255).Now, let me summarize what I have:1. From (x = 1): (a = 1).2. From (x = 2): (a + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8 = 0) which gives (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_8 = -1).3. From (x = 0): (a - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 256) which gives (-a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 255).So, I have two equations:- (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_8 = -1)- (-a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 255)If I add these two equations together, the (a_1) and (-a_1) will cancel out, as well as the odd terms with alternating signs. Let me see:Adding equation 1 and equation 2:[(a_1 - a_1) + (a_2 + a_2) + (a_3 - a_3) + ldots + (a_8 + a_8) = (-1) + 255]Simplifying:[0 + 2a_2 + 0 + 2a_4 + ldots + 2a_8 = 254]So, (2(a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8) = 254), which means (a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8 = 127).Similarly, if I subtract equation 2 from equation 1:[(a_1 + a_1) + (a_2 - a_2) + (a_3 + a_3) + ldots + (a_8 - a_8) = (-1) - 255]Simplifying:[2a_1 + 0 + 2a_3 + ldots + 0 = -256]So, (2(a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7) = -256), which means (a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7 = -128).Alright, so now I have:- (a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8 = 127)- (a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7 = -128)The problem asks for (left(a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_8right)^2 - left(a_1 + a_3 + ldots + a_7right)^2). Let me compute that:First, compute each square:- (127^2 = 16129)- ((-128)^2 = 16384)Then subtract:(16129 - 16384 = -255)So, the value is (-255).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the beginning:1. Plugging (x = 1): Got (a = 1). That seems correct.2. Plugging (x = 2): Got (a + a_1 + ... + a_8 = 0), so (a_1 + ... + a_8 = -1). That makes sense.3. Plugging (x = 0): Got (a - a_1 + a_2 - ... + a_8 = 256), so (-a_1 + a_2 - ... + a_8 = 255). That also seems correct.Adding the two equations:- (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_8 = -1)- (-a_1 + a_2 - ... + a_8 = 255)Adding them gives (2(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) = 254), so (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 = 127). Correct.Subtracting the second equation from the first:- (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_8 = -1)- (-a_1 + a_2 - ... + a_8 = 255)Subtracting gives (2(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) = -256), so (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = -128). Correct.Then, computing the squares:- (127^2 = 16129)- ((-128)^2 = 16384)Subtracting: (16129 - 16384 = -255). Yep, that's right.So, I think my answer is correct.

I need to find the probability that the circumference of the circle is less than ten times the area of the circle. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that the circumference ( C ) of a circle is given by the formula ( C = pi d ), where ( d ) is the diameter. The area ( A ) of a circle is ( A = pi r^2 ), and since the radius ( r ) is half the diameter, that becomes ( A = pi left( frac{d}{2} right)^2 = frac{pi d^2}{4} ).So, the problem is asking for the probability that ( C < 10A ). Let me write that out with the formulas:[pi d < 10 times frac{pi d^2}{4}]Hmm, okay, let me simplify this inequality. First, I can cancel out ( pi ) from both sides since it's a positive constant and won't affect the inequality:[d < 10 times frac{d^2}{4}]Simplify the right side:[d < frac{10d^2}{4} = frac{5d^2}{2}]Now, let's get all terms to one side to make it easier to solve:[0 < frac{5d^2}{2} - d]Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:[0 < 5d^2 - 2d]Factor out a ( d ):[0 < d(5d - 2)]So, the inequality ( d(5d - 2) > 0 ) needs to be satisfied. Let's solve this inequality. The product of two terms is positive if both terms are positive or both are negative.First, consider the critical points where each factor is zero:1. ( d = 0 )2. ( 5d - 2 = 0 ) → ( d = frac{2}{5} = 0.4 )These critical points divide the number line into intervals. Let's test each interval:1. For ( d < 0 ): Since ( d ) is the diameter of a circle, it can't be negative. So, we can ignore this interval.2. For ( 0 < d < 0.4 ): Let's pick ( d = 0.2 ). Then, ( d = 0.2 ) is positive, and ( 5d - 2 = 5(0.2) - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 ). So, the product is ( 0.2 times (-1) = -0.2 ), which is negative. So, the inequality is not satisfied here.3. For ( d > 0.4 ): Let's pick ( d = 1 ). Then, ( d = 1 ) is positive, and ( 5d - 2 = 5(1) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 ). So, the product is ( 1 times 3 = 3 ), which is positive. So, the inequality is satisfied here.Therefore, the inequality ( d(5d - 2) > 0 ) holds true when ( d > 0.4 ).Now, since we're rolling a 12-sided die, the possible outcomes for ( d ) are the integers from 1 to 12. All these outcomes are greater than 0.4, right? Because the smallest possible diameter is 1, which is definitely greater than 0.4.So, every possible outcome satisfies the condition ( C < 10A ). That means the probability is 1, since no matter what we roll, the condition will always be true.Wait, let me double-check. If ( d = 1 ), then ( C = pi times 1 = pi ) and ( A = frac{pi times 1^2}{4} = frac{pi}{4} ). Then, ( 10A = 10 times frac{pi}{4} = frac{10pi}{4} = frac{5pi}{2} ). Comparing ( C = pi ) and ( 10A = frac{5pi}{2} ), since ( pi ) is approximately 3.14, ( frac{5pi}{2} ) is approximately 7.85. So, ( pi < frac{5pi}{2} ) is true.Similarly, for ( d = 2 ), ( C = 2pi ) and ( A = frac{pi times 4}{4} = pi ). So, ( 10A = 10pi ). Comparing ( 2pi ) and ( 10pi ), obviously ( 2pi < 10pi ).This pattern continues for all ( d ) from 1 to 12. Therefore, every possible outcome satisfies the condition, so the probability is indeed 1.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"The coefficient of x in the expansion of (x^{2}+3x+2)^{6} is ( ).A: 92B: 576C: 192D: 384","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the coefficient of ( x ) in the expansion of ( (x^2 + 3x + 2)^6 ). The options are A: 92, B: 576, C: 192, D: 384. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.First, I remember that when expanding expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is useful. But wait, this isn't a binomial; it's a trinomial because there are three terms: ( x^2 ), ( 3x ), and ( 2 ). So, maybe I need to use the multinomial theorem instead? Or perhaps there's a simpler way since I'm only looking for the coefficient of ( x ).Let me think. If I expand ( (x^2 + 3x + 2)^6 ), each term in the expansion is formed by picking one term from each of the six factors and multiplying them together. So, to get a term with just ( x ), I need the exponents of ( x ) from all the factors to add up to 1. But wait, each factor is ( x^2 + 3x + 2 ). So, in each factor, the possible contributions to the exponent of ( x ) are 2 (from ( x^2 )), 1 (from ( 3x )), or 0 (from the constant term 2). Since I need the total exponent to be 1, I have to figure out how to get exponents from each factor that add up to 1.Let me denote each factor as ( (x^2 + 3x + 2) ). When I multiply six of these together, each term in the expansion is a product of terms from each factor. So, for each of the six factors, I can choose either ( x^2 ), ( 3x ), or ( 2 ). The exponents from each choice add up, and the coefficients multiply.Since I need the exponent of ( x ) to be 1, let's think about how that can happen. Each time I pick ( x^2 ) from a factor, that contributes 2 to the exponent. Each time I pick ( 3x ), that contributes 1. Each time I pick 2, that contributes 0. So, the total exponent is the sum of these contributions.But wait, if I pick ( x^2 ) even once, that would contribute 2, which is already more than 1. So, to get a total exponent of 1, I cannot pick ( x^2 ) from any of the six factors. That means, from each factor, I can only pick either ( 3x ) or ( 2 ). So, the problem reduces to finding the coefficient of ( x ) in the expansion of ( (3x + 2)^6 ). Because if I can't pick ( x^2 ) from any factor, then effectively, each factor is just ( 3x + 2 ).Now, this is a binomial expansion, which is more straightforward. The general term in the expansion of ( (a + b)^n ) is given by ( binom{n}{k} a^{k} b^{n - k} ). In this case, ( a = 3x ), ( b = 2 ), and ( n = 6 ).I need the term where the exponent of ( x ) is 1. That means I need the term where ( a ) is raised to the power of 1, because ( (3x)^1 ) will give me an ( x ) term. So, ( k = 1 ).Calculating the coefficient for this term: ( binom{6}{1} times (3x)^1 times 2^{6 - 1} ).Let's compute this step by step.First, ( binom{6}{1} ) is 6.Then, ( (3x)^1 ) is ( 3x ).Next, ( 2^{5} ) is 32.Multiplying these together: 6 * 3 * 32.6 * 3 is 18, and 18 * 32 is... let's see, 18 * 30 is 540, and 18 * 2 is 36, so 540 + 36 = 576.So, the coefficient of ( x ) is 576. Looking back at the options, that's option B.Wait, but hold on a second. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Because I remember that in the original expression, each factor was ( x^2 + 3x + 2 ), and I assumed that we can't pick ( x^2 ) because it would contribute too much to the exponent. But is that the only way?Let me double-check. Suppose I pick ( x^2 ) from one factor and ( 3x ) from another. Then, the exponents would add up to 2 + 1 = 3, which is more than 1. Similarly, picking ( x^2 ) from two factors would give 4, which is even worse. So, indeed, to get a total exponent of 1, we cannot pick ( x^2 ) from any factor. Therefore, my initial reasoning was correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a multinomial expansion. The general term in the expansion of ( (x^2 + 3x + 2)^6 ) is given by:[frac{6!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} (x^2)^{k_1} (3x)^{k_2} (2)^{k_3}]where ( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 6 ).The exponent of ( x ) in each term is ( 2k_1 + k_2 ). We need this exponent to be 1. So,[2k_1 + k_2 = 1]But ( k_1 ), ( k_2 ), and ( k_3 ) are non-negative integers. Let's see if there are solutions to this equation.If ( k_1 = 0 ), then ( k_2 = 1 ). Then ( k_3 = 6 - 0 - 1 = 5 ).If ( k_1 = 1 ), then ( 2(1) + k_2 = 1 ) implies ( k_2 = -1 ), which is not possible because ( k_2 ) can't be negative.Similarly, higher ( k_1 ) would make ( k_2 ) even more negative, which is impossible. So, the only solution is ( k_1 = 0 ), ( k_2 = 1 ), ( k_3 = 5 ).Therefore, the term corresponding to this is:[frac{6!}{0! 1! 5!} (x^2)^0 (3x)^1 (2)^5]Calculating the coefficient:[frac{720}{1 times 1 times 120} times 1 times 3x times 32]Simplify the factorial part:[frac{720}{120} = 6]So, the coefficient is:[6 times 3 times 32 = 6 times 96 = 576]Same result as before. So, that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 576, which is option B.But wait, just to be thorough, is there any other way to get an exponent of 1? For example, if I pick ( x^2 ) from one factor and ( 3x ) from another, but then somehow subtract exponents? No, exponents just add up. So, once you pick ( x^2 ), it's adding 2, which can't be undone. So, no, that's not possible.Alternatively, could I have negative exponents? No, because all the terms in the expansion have non-negative exponents. So, that's not a concern.Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of ( x ) is 576, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given a set containing three elements {a, frac{b}{a}, 1} = {a^2, a+b, 0}, find the value of a^{2016} + b^{2017}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two sets that are equal to each other. The first set is {a, b/a, 1} and the second set is {a², a+b, 0}. I need to find the value of a²⁰¹⁶ + b²⁰¹⁷. Hmm, sets are unordered and have distinct elements, so the elements in both sets must match, but not necessarily in the same order. First, since both sets are equal, every element in the first set must be in the second set and vice versa. Let me list out the elements:First set: a, b/a, 1Second set: a², a+b, 0So, the elements 0, a², and a+b must correspond to a, b/a, and 1. Looking at the first set, there's a 1, so 1 must be equal to one of the elements in the second set. The second set has a², a+b, and 0. So, 1 could be equal to a², a+b, or 0. But 1 can't be equal to 0, so 1 must be either a² or a+b.Similarly, looking at the second set, there's a 0, so 0 must be equal to one of the elements in the first set. The first set has a, b/a, and 1. So, 0 must be equal to either a, b/a, or 1. But 0 can't be equal to 1, so 0 must be equal to a or b/a. Let me consider the possibilities:Case 1: 0 = aIf a = 0, then looking at the first set, we have 0, b/0, and 1. Wait, b/0 is undefined, so that can't be possible. Therefore, a can't be 0.Case 2: 0 = b/aIf 0 = b/a, then b must be 0 because any number divided by a non-zero number is 0. So, b = 0.Now, with b = 0, let's substitute back into the sets.First set becomes {a, 0/a, 1} which simplifies to {a, 0, 1}.Second set becomes {a², a + 0, 0} which simplifies to {a², a, 0}.So now, both sets are {a, 0, 1} and {a², a, 0}. Since sets are unordered, the elements must match. Therefore, the elements a² must be equal to one of the elements in the first set, which are a, 0, or 1.So, a² must be equal to a, 0, or 1.Let's consider each possibility:Subcase 1: a² = aThen, a² - a = 0 => a(a - 1) = 0 => a = 0 or a = 1But earlier, we saw that a can't be 0 because that would make b/a undefined. So, a = 1.But if a = 1, then let's check the sets:First set: {1, 0, 1} which simplifies to {0, 1} because sets have distinct elements.Second set: {1², 1 + 0, 0} which is {1, 1, 0} simplifying to {0, 1}.So, both sets are {0, 1}, but originally, the first set had three elements {a, b/a, 1}, which would be {1, 0, 1}, but since sets can't have duplicate elements, it's just {0, 1}. Similarly, the second set becomes {1, 1, 0} which is {0, 1}. So, they are equal, but wait, the original sets were supposed to have three elements each, but with a = 1 and b = 0, they both reduce to two elements. That seems problematic because the original sets were given as three-element sets. So, maybe a = 1 is not acceptable because it reduces the set size. Therefore, a² = a leads to a problem because it reduces the number of elements in the set.Subcase 2: a² = 0If a² = 0, then a = 0. But we already saw that a can't be 0 because b/a would be undefined. So, this is not possible.Subcase 3: a² = 1So, a² = 1 implies that a = 1 or a = -1.If a = 1, as before, we run into the problem of the set reducing to two elements, which contradicts the original sets having three elements. Therefore, a must be -1.Let's check a = -1:First set: {a, b/a, 1} = {-1, 0/(-1), 1} = {-1, 0, 1}Second set: {a², a + b, 0} = {(-1)², -1 + 0, 0} = {1, -1, 0}So, both sets are {-1, 0, 1}, which matches perfectly. Great, so a = -1 and b = 0.Now, we need to find a²⁰¹⁶ + b²⁰¹⁷.Since a = -1, let's compute a²⁰¹⁶:(-1) raised to any even power is 1. 2016 is even, so (-1)²⁰¹⁶ = 1.b = 0, so 0 raised to any positive power is 0. 2017 is positive, so 0²⁰¹⁷ = 0.Therefore, a²⁰¹⁶ + b²⁰¹⁷ = 1 + 0 = 1.So, the answer is 1.I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.We started by noting that 0 must be in the first set, so either a or b/a is 0. Since a can't be 0, b must be 0. Then, substituting b = 0, we saw that a² must be 1, leading to a = -1 (since a = 1 would reduce the set size). Finally, computing the required powers gives us 1 + 0 = 1. Yep, that seems solid."},{"question":"Given that F is the right focus of the hyperbola C:x^{2}-frac{y^{2}}{3}=1, and P is a point on C such that PF is perpendicular to the x-axis.

Let me try to understand what each part means and how to approach it step by step.First, the hyperbola is given by the equation ( x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 ). I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where 'a' and 'b' are constants that define the shape and orientation of the hyperbola. Comparing this to the given equation, it looks like ( a^2 = 1 ) and ( b^2 = 3 ), so ( a = 1 ) and ( b = sqrt{3} ).Now, the hyperbola is centered at the origin (0,0) because there are no shifts in the equation. Since the positive term is with ( x^2 ), the hyperbola opens left and right along the x-axis.The problem mentions that F is the right focus of the hyperbola. I recall that for hyperbolas, the distance from the center to each focus is given by ( c ), where ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). Plugging in the values we have:( c^2 = 1 + 3 = 4 ), so ( c = 2 ).Since it's the right focus, F must be at (2, 0).Next, point P is on the hyperbola such that PF is perpendicular to the x-axis. Hmm, PF is a line segment from point P to focus F, and it's perpendicular to the x-axis. If a line is perpendicular to the x-axis, it must be vertical. So, PF is a vertical line. That means the x-coordinate of P must be the same as that of F because a vertical line doesn't change in the x-direction.Since F is at (2, 0), P must have an x-coordinate of 2. So, P is (2, y) for some y. Now, I can plug this into the hyperbola equation to find the y-coordinate.Substituting x = 2 into ( x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 ):( (2)^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 )( 4 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 )Subtract 4 from both sides:( -frac{y^2}{3} = -3 )Multiply both sides by -3:( y^2 = 9 )Taking square roots:( y = pm 3 )So, there are two possible points for P: (2, 3) and (2, -3). The problem doesn't specify which one, but since it's a hyperbola, both are valid. However, since the focus F is at (2, 0), and the point A is given as (1, 3), which is above the x-axis, it might make sense for P to also be above the x-axis to form a triangle with A and F. So, I'll choose P as (2, 3).Now, I need to find the area of triangle APF, where A is (1, 3), P is (2, 3), and F is (2, 0).I can visualize this triangle. Points A and P have the same y-coordinate, so the line AP is horizontal. The distance between A and P is just the difference in their x-coordinates, which is 2 - 1 = 1 unit. Point F is directly below P on the x-axis. The distance from P to F is the vertical distance, which is 3 - 0 = 3 units.So, if I consider AP as the base of the triangle, which is 1 unit, and the height as the vertical distance from F to this base, which is 3 units, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle:Area = (1/2) * base * heightPlugging in the values:Area = (1/2) * 1 * 3 = 3/2Alternatively, I can use the coordinates to calculate the area using the shoelace formula or by finding vectors, but since the points form a right triangle, the simple base-height method works perfectly here.Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Identified the hyperbola equation and found a, b, c correctly.2. Determined the coordinates of F as (2, 0) correctly.3. Understood that PF is vertical, so P must be (2, y).4. Plugged x = 2 into the hyperbola equation to find y = ±3, chose y = 3 for consistency with point A.5. Calculated the distances between points correctly.6. Applied the area formula accurately.Everything seems to check out. I think the area is indeed 3/2.**Final Answer**The area of triangle APF is boxed{dfrac{3}{2}}."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively.

The sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively. There are two vectors given: vector m is (b, √3 a) and vector n is (cos B, sin A). It's also given that vector m is parallel to vector n. Part (1) asks for the measure of angle B. Hmm, okay. Since the vectors are parallel, that means one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, vector m = k * vector n for some scalar k. That would mean their components are proportional. So, the first component of m is b, and the first component of n is cos B. Similarly, the second component of m is √3 a, and the second component of n is sin A. So, setting up the proportionality, we have:b / cos B = √3 a / sin AThat's because if vector m is parallel to vector n, then each component of m divided by the corresponding component of n should be equal. So, b / cos B should equal √3 a / sin A.Now, I remember from the Law of Sines that in any triangle, a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C. So, maybe I can use that here. Let me denote this common ratio as 2R, where R is the radius of the circumcircle, but maybe I don't need that right now.So, from the Law of Sines, a / sin A = b / sin B. Let's write that as a = (b sin A) / sin B.Wait, maybe I can substitute a in terms of b and the sines of the angles. Let me try that.From the proportionality, b / cos B = √3 a / sin A.Substituting a from the Law of Sines, a = (b sin A) / sin B, so:b / cos B = √3 * (b sin A / sin B) / sin ASimplify the right side: √3 * (b sin A) / (sin B sin A) ) = √3 b / sin BSo, now we have:b / cos B = √3 b / sin BWe can cancel b from both sides since b ≠ 0.So, 1 / cos B = √3 / sin BCross-multiplying, we get sin B = √3 cos BDividing both sides by cos B (assuming cos B ≠ 0), we get tan B = √3So, tan B = √3. Now, what angle between 0 and π has a tangent of √3? That's π/3, which is 60 degrees.So, angle B is π/3 radians or 60 degrees.Wait, let me double-check. If tan B = √3, then yes, B is 60 degrees because tan(60°) = √3.Okay, so part (1) is solved. Angle B is π/3.Now, moving on to part (2). It says if b = 2, and the area of triangle ABC is √3, find the value of a + c.Alright, so b = 2, area = √3. We need to find a + c.First, let's recall that the area of a triangle can be given by (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, maybe it's better to use the formula involving sides a and c and angle B.Wait, since we know angle B is π/3, and sides a and c are opposite angles A and C respectively, maybe the area can be expressed as (1/2)ac sin B.Yes, that's correct. So, area = (1/2)ac sin B.Given that area is √3, and sin B is sin(π/3) = √3/2.So, plugging in:√3 = (1/2) * a * c * (√3/2)Simplify the right side:(1/2) * a * c * (√3/2) = (a c √3)/4So, √3 = (a c √3)/4Multiply both sides by 4:4√3 = a c √3Divide both sides by √3:4 = a cSo, a * c = 4.Okay, so the product of a and c is 4.Now, we also know from the Law of Cosines that b² = a² + c² - 2ac cos B.Since b = 2, B = π/3, so cos B = cos(π/3) = 1/2.So, plugging into the Law of Cosines:2² = a² + c² - 2ac*(1/2)Simplify:4 = a² + c² - acBut we know that a * c = 4, so:4 = a² + c² - 4So, a² + c² = 8.Now, we need to find a + c. Let's denote S = a + c, and P = a * c = 4.We know that (a + c)² = a² + 2ac + c².We have a² + c² = 8, and ac = 4, so:S² = 8 + 2*4 = 8 + 8 = 16Therefore, S = √16 = 4.So, a + c = 4.Wait, let me check that again.We have a² + c² = 8, and a*c = 4.So, (a + c)² = a² + 2ac + c² = (a² + c²) + 2ac = 8 + 8 = 16.Therefore, a + c = √16 = 4.Yes, that seems correct.So, the value of a + c is 4.I think that's it. Let me just recap.For part (1), using the fact that vectors are parallel, we set up the proportionality, used the Law of Sines to relate a and b, and found that tan B = √3, so B = π/3.For part (2), using the area formula, we found that a*c = 4, then applied the Law of Cosines to find a² + c² = 8, and then used the identity (a + c)² = a² + 2ac + c² to find that a + c = 4.Everything seems to check out."},{"question":"Given f(2^x) = x + 1, then f(x) =  ?","answer":"First, I need to express the function ( f ) in terms of ( x ) instead of ( 2^x ).

If point P is one of the intersection points of the ellipse and the hyperbola, find the value of |PF_1| cdot |PF_2|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's an ellipse and a hyperbola that share the same foci, F₁ and F₂. The ellipse is given by the equation x²/m² + y²/9 = 1, where m is greater than 0. The hyperbola is given by x²/n² - y²/4 = 1, with n also greater than 0. I need to find the value of |PF₁| multiplied by |PF₂|, where P is one of the intersection points of the ellipse and the hyperbola.First, I remember that for both ellipses and hyperbolas, the distance between the foci is related to the parameters of the conic sections. For an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus is given by c = √(a² - b²), where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. For a hyperbola, the distance from the center to each focus is c = √(a² + b²), where a is the distance from the center to a vertex and b is related to the conjugate axis.In this case, both the ellipse and the hyperbola share the same foci, so their c values must be equal. Let me write that down:For the ellipse: c = √(m² - 9)For the hyperbola: c = √(n² + 4)Since these are equal, I can set them equal to each other:√(m² - 9) = √(n² + 4)If I square both sides to eliminate the square roots, I get:m² - 9 = n² + 4Let me rearrange this equation to find a relationship between m² and n²:m² - n² = 9 + 4m² - n² = 13So, m squared minus n squared equals 13. I'll keep this in mind.Now, moving on to the point P, which is an intersection point of the ellipse and the hyperbola. I need to find |PF₁| multiplied by |PF₂|. Hmm, I think I can use some properties of ellipses and hyperbolas here.For an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a, where a is the semi-major axis. In this case, the ellipse equation is x²/m² + y²/9 = 1, so the semi-major axis is m, and the semi-minor axis is 3. Therefore, for any point P on the ellipse, |PF₁| + |PF₂| = 2m.For a hyperbola, the difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a, where a is the distance from the center to a vertex. The hyperbola equation is x²/n² - y²/4 = 1, so a² = n² and b² = 4. Therefore, for any point P on the hyperbola, |PF₁| - |PF₂| = 2n. Wait, actually, it's the absolute difference, so it could be |PF₁| - |PF₂| = 2n or |PF₂| - |PF₁| = 2n, depending on which branch of the hyperbola P is on. But since P is an intersection point, I think it's safe to assume it's on the right branch, so |PF₁| - |PF₂| = 2n.So, I have two equations:1. |PF₁| + |PF₂| = 2m2. |PF₁| - |PF₂| = 2nI can solve these two equations to find |PF₁| and |PF₂| individually, but since I need their product, maybe there's a smarter way to find |PF₁| * |PF₂| without finding each distance separately.Let me denote |PF₁| as d₁ and |PF₂| as d₂ for simplicity. Then:d₁ + d₂ = 2md₁ - d₂ = 2nIf I square both equations, I can then subtract them to find the product d₁ * d₂.First, square the first equation:(d₁ + d₂)² = (2m)²d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² = 4m²Then, square the second equation:(d₁ - d₂)² = (2n)²d₁² - 2d₁d₂ + d₂² = 4n²Now, subtract the second squared equation from the first squared equation:(d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂²) - (d₁² - 2d₁d₂ + d₂²) = 4m² - 4n²Simplify the left side:d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² - d₁² + 2d₁d₂ - d₂² = 4m² - 4n²The d₁² and d₂² terms cancel out:4d₁d₂ = 4m² - 4n²Divide both sides by 4:d₁d₂ = m² - n²But earlier, I found that m² - n² = 13. So, substituting that in:d₁d₂ = 13Therefore, |PF₁| * |PF₂| = 13.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I set up the equations correctly based on the definitions of ellipse and hyperbola. Then, I squared both equations and subtracted them to eliminate the squared terms, which gave me 4d₁d₂ = 4(m² - n²). Then, since m² - n² = 13, substituting that in gives d₁d₂ = 13. That seems correct.I think I can be confident that the value of |PF₁| * |PF₂| is 13.**Final Answer**The value of ( |PF_1| cdot |PF_2| ) is boxed{13}."},{"question":"Given that the terminal side of the angle α+ frac {π}{6} passes through point P(-1, -2sqrt {2}), find the value of sinα.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the terminal side of the angle α + π/6 passes through the point P(-1, -2√2). I need to find the value of sin α. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when an angle is given in terms of its terminal side passing through a specific point, we can use the coordinates of that point to find the sine and cosine of that angle. The point P(-1, -2√2) is in the third quadrant because both x and y are negative. That might be important for the signs of sine and cosine.So, the angle in question is α + π/6. Let's denote this angle as θ for simplicity, where θ = α + π/6. That means θ is the angle whose terminal side passes through P(-1, -2√2). I need to find sin α, which is sin(θ - π/6). To find this, I can use the sine subtraction formula: sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.But first, I need to find sin θ and cos θ. Since θ is the angle whose terminal side passes through P(-1, -2√2), I can find the radius (r) of the circle centered at the origin that passes through P. The radius r is the distance from the origin to the point P, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:r = √(x² + y²) = √[(-1)² + (-2√2)²] = √[1 + (4 * 2)] = √[1 + 8] = √9 = 3.Okay, so r is 3. Now, sin θ is y/r, which is (-2√2)/3, and cos θ is x/r, which is (-1)/3. So, sin θ = -2√2/3 and cos θ = -1/3.Now, I need to find sin α, which is sin(θ - π/6). Using the sine subtraction formula:sin(θ - π/6) = sin θ cos(π/6) - cos θ sin(π/6).I know that cos(π/6) is √3/2 and sin(π/6) is 1/2. So, plugging in the values:sin(θ - π/6) = (-2√2/3)(√3/2) - (-1/3)(1/2).Let me compute each term separately.First term: (-2√2/3)(√3/2). The 2s cancel out, so it becomes (-√2 * √3)/3 = (-√6)/3.Second term: (-1/3)(1/2) = (-1)/6. But there's a negative sign in front of this term in the formula, so it becomes +1/6.So, combining both terms:sin(θ - π/6) = (-√6)/3 + 1/6.To combine these, I need a common denominator. The first term has a denominator of 3, which is equivalent to 6/2. So, let's write (-√6)/3 as (-2√6)/6.Now, adding the two terms:(-2√6)/6 + 1/6 = (1 - 2√6)/6.So, sin α = (1 - 2√6)/6.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the beginning: θ = α + π/6, and P(-1, -2√2) is on the terminal side of θ. Calculated r = 3, so sin θ = -2√2/3 and cos θ = -1/3. Then, using the sine subtraction formula:sin(θ - π/6) = sin θ cos(π/6) - cos θ sin(π/6).Plugging in the values:(-2√2/3)(√3/2) - (-1/3)(1/2).First term: (-2√2 * √3)/(3*2) = (-2√6)/6 = (-√6)/3.Second term: (-1/3)(1/2) = (-1)/6, but with a negative sign in front, so +1/6.Combining: (-√6)/3 + 1/6.Convert to common denominator:(-2√6)/6 + 1/6 = (1 - 2√6)/6.Yes, that seems correct. So, sin α is (1 - 2√6)/6.I think that's the answer. Let me just visualize the angle to make sure the signs make sense. Since θ is in the third quadrant, both sin θ and cos θ are negative, which matches our calculations. Then, when we subtract π/6 from θ, we're moving the angle towards the origin, but since θ is in the third quadrant, α would be in the third or fourth quadrant depending on how much we subtract. However, since the sine is (1 - 2√6)/6, which is approximately (1 - 4.899)/6 ≈ (-3.899)/6 ≈ -0.6498, which is negative, so α is in the third or fourth quadrant. Given that θ is in the third quadrant, subtracting π/6 might place α in the third or fourth. But since the sine is negative, it's either third or fourth. The exact value is (1 - 2√6)/6, which is approximately -0.65, so it's negative, consistent with being in the third or fourth quadrant. Since θ is in the third quadrant, subtracting π/6 (which is 30 degrees) would bring α closer to the negative x-axis, so it's still in the third quadrant. So, the negative sine makes sense.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I'm confident that the answer is (1 - 2√6)/6."},{"question":"Draw a tangent line MN to the circle (x-2)^2+(y-2)^2=1 at point N, where N is the point of tangency. If |MN|=|MO| (where O is the origin), then the minimum value of |MN| is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a circle with the equation ((x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 1). That means the center of the circle is at (2, 2), and the radius is 1. Got that.Now, the problem says to draw a tangent line MN to this circle at point N, where N is the point of tangency. So, M is a point outside the circle, and MN is the tangent from M to the circle, touching it at N. The condition given is that the length of MN is equal to the length of MO, where O is the origin (0, 0). So, |MN| = |MO|. I need to find the minimum value of |MN|.Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since MN is a tangent to the circle, I remember that the tangent from a point outside the circle has some properties. Specifically, the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. So, the line from the center of the circle to N is perpendicular to MN.Let me denote the center of the circle as C, which is (2, 2). So, CN is the radius, which has length 1, and CN is perpendicular to MN. Now, since |MN| = |MO|, I can write that |MN| = |MO|. Let me denote M as (x, y). Then, |MO| is the distance from M to the origin, which is (sqrt{x^2 + y^2}). But |MN| is the length of the tangent from M to the circle. There's a formula for the length of the tangent from a point (x, y) to a circle with center (h, k) and radius r, which is (sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 - r^2}). So, in this case, |MN| would be (sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1}). Given that |MN| = |MO|, we can set up the equation:[sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1} = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}]To eliminate the square roots, I'll square both sides:[(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1 = x^2 + y^2]Let me expand the left side:[(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 1 = x^2 + y^2]Combine like terms:[x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 4y + 4 - 1 = x^2 + y^2]Simplify:[x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 4y + 7 = x^2 + y^2]Subtract (x^2 + y^2) from both sides:[-4x - 4y + 7 = 0]So, the equation simplifies to:[4x + 4y = 7]Or, dividing both sides by 4:[x + y = frac{7}{4}]So, point M lies on the line (x + y = frac{7}{4}). Now, I need to find the minimum value of |MN|. But since |MN| = |MO|, I can instead find the minimum value of |MO|, which is the distance from M to the origin. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum distance from the origin to a point M on the line (x + y = frac{7}{4}). I remember that the distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (ax + by + c = 0) is given by:[text{Distance} = frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}]In this case, the line is (x + y - frac{7}{4} = 0), so (a = 1), (b = 1), and (c = -frac{7}{4}). The point is the origin (0, 0). Plugging into the formula:[text{Distance} = frac{|1 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 0 - frac{7}{4}|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{frac{7}{4}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{7}{4sqrt{2}} = frac{7sqrt{2}}{8}]So, the minimum distance from the origin to the line is (frac{7sqrt{2}}{8}). Therefore, the minimum value of |MN| is also (frac{7sqrt{2}}{8}).Wait, let me double-check my steps. I set up the equation correctly, squared both sides, expanded, and simplified. The resulting line equation seems right. Then, using the distance formula from a point to a line, I plugged in the values correctly. The calculation looks good.

The solution set is given as all real numbers ( x ) such that ( x < -2 ) or ( x > 4 ). I need to figure out the relationship between the function values at ( x = 5 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = -1 ). The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order of these function values.First, I remember that for a quadratic inequality, the solution set tells me about the graph of the quadratic function. Since the inequality is ( > 0 ) and the solution is ( x < -2 ) or ( x > 4 ), this means the quadratic opens upwards because the parabola is above the x-axis outside the interval ([-2, 4]). So, the coefficient ( a ) must be positive.Next, the roots of the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) are ( x = -2 ) and ( x = 4 ). Therefore, the quadratic can be written in its factored form as ( a(x + 2)(x - 4) ). If I expand this, it becomes ( a(x^2 - 2x - 8) ). So, the quadratic function is ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = a(x^2 - 2x - 8) ).Now, the vertex of this parabola is at the midpoint of the roots. The midpoint between ( -2 ) and ( 4 ) is ( frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1 ). So, the axis of symmetry is ( x = 1 ). Since the parabola opens upwards, the function is decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right of the vertex.This means that for ( x < 1 ), the function is decreasing, and for ( x > 1 ), it's increasing. So, as we move from left to right across the vertex, the function's value decreases until ( x = 1 ) and then increases after that.Given this, let's evaluate the function at the points ( x = -1 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = 5 ).First, ( x = -1 ). Since ( -1 ) is less than ( 1 ), it's on the decreasing side of the parabola. Similarly, ( x = 2 ) is greater than ( 1 ), so it's on the increasing side. ( x = 5 ) is also greater than ( 1 ), further along the increasing side.But wait, I also remember that because of the axis of symmetry at ( x = 1 ), the function values at points equidistant from the vertex are equal. So, for example, ( f(1 + t) = f(1 - t) ) for any ( t ). Let me check: for ( x = -1 ), the distance from 1 is ( | -1 - 1 | = 2 ). So, the point symmetric to ( x = -1 ) is ( x = 3 ). Therefore, ( f(-1) = f(3) ).Similarly, ( x = 2 ) is 1 unit away from the vertex on the right side, so its symmetric point is ( x = 0 ). But I don't have ( f(0) ) in my points, so maybe that's not directly useful.But knowing that ( f(-1) = f(3) ) might help. Since ( x = 3 ) is on the increasing side of the parabola (because ( 3 > 1 )), and ( x = 2 ) is also on the increasing side but closer to the vertex, I can compare ( f(2) ), ( f(3) ), and ( f(5) ).Since the function is increasing for ( x > 1 ), the larger the ( x ), the larger the function value. So, ( f(2) < f(3) < f(5) ).But wait, ( f(3) = f(-1) ), so substituting that in, we get ( f(2) < f(-1) < f(5) ).So, putting it all together, the order is ( f(2) < f(-1) < f(5) ), which corresponds to option D.Let me just verify this. If I plug in the points into the quadratic function, maybe I can see it more clearly.Given ( f(x) = a(x + 2)(x - 4) ). Let's choose a specific value for ( a ) to make calculations easier. Since ( a > 0 ), let's take ( a = 1 ) for simplicity. So, ( f(x) = (x + 2)(x - 4) = x^2 - 2x - 8 ).Now, compute ( f(-1) ):( f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 8 = 1 + 2 - 8 = -5 ).Compute ( f(2) ):( f(2) = (2)^2 - 2(2) - 8 = 4 - 4 - 8 = -8 ).Compute ( f(5) ):( f(5) = (5)^2 - 2(5) - 8 = 25 - 10 - 8 = 7 ).So, ( f(-1) = -5 ), ( f(2) = -8 ), ( f(5) = 7 ).Comparing these values: ( -8 < -5 < 7 ), which is ( f(2) < f(-1) < f(5) ). So, yes, that's consistent with what I concluded earlier.Therefore, the correct answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Use mathematical induction to prove that 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2n + 1) = (n + 1)(2n + 1). When going from n = k to n = k + 1, the algebraic expression that needs to be added to the left side is (　　)A: 2k + 2B: 2k + 3C: 2k + 1D: (2k + 2) + (2k + 3)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here that asks me to use mathematical induction to prove that the sum of the first (2n + 1) natural numbers is equal to ((n + 1)(2n + 1)). Then, it specifically asks what algebraic expression needs to be added to the left side when moving from (n = k) to (n = k + 1). The options are A: (2k + 2), B: (2k + 3), C: (2k + 1), and D: ((2k + 2) + (2k + 3)).Okay, let me start by recalling what mathematical induction is. It's a method of proving statements about natural numbers. It involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you show that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually (n = 1). The inductive step is where you assume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number (k) and then show that it must also be true for (k + 1).So, first, let me check the base case. When (n = 1), the left side of the equation is the sum from 1 to (2(1) + 1), which is 1 + 2 + 3. That adds up to 6. The right side is ((1 + 1)(2(1) + 1)), which is (2 times 3 = 6). So, the base case holds true.Now, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for (n = k). That is, I assume that:[1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)(2k + 1)]This is my induction hypothesis. Now, I need to show that the statement holds for (n = k + 1). That means I need to show that:[1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2k + 1) + [2(k + 1) + 1] = ((k + 1) + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)]Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I understand what the sum up to (2(k + 1) + 1) is. If (n = k + 1), then the last term is (2(k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 2 + 1 = 2k + 3). So, the sum up to (2k + 3) is:[1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2k + 1) + (2k + 2) + (2k + 3)]But according to my induction hypothesis, I already know the sum up to (2k + 1). So, if I subtract that from the sum up to (2k + 3), I should get the terms that need to be added when moving from (n = k) to (n = k + 1). Let me write that out:Sum up to (2k + 3): (1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2k + 1) + (2k + 2) + (2k + 3))Sum up to (2k + 1): (1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2k + 1))Therefore, the difference between these two sums is:[(2k + 2) + (2k + 3)]So, when moving from (n = k) to (n = k + 1), we need to add these two terms to the left side of the equation.Let me verify this. If I have the sum up to (2k + 1), which is ((k + 1)(2k + 1)), and then I add ((2k + 2) + (2k + 3)), the new sum should be equal to ((k + 2)(2(k + 1) + 1)), which simplifies to ((k + 2)(2k + 3)).Let me compute the left side:[(k + 1)(2k + 1) + (2k + 2) + (2k + 3)]First, expand ((k + 1)(2k + 1)):[k(2k + 1) + 1(2k + 1) = 2k^2 + k + 2k + 1 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1]Now, add ((2k + 2) + (2k + 3)):[2k^2 + 3k + 1 + 2k + 2 + 2k + 3]Combine like terms:- (2k^2)- (3k + 2k + 2k = 7k)- (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)So, the total becomes:[2k^2 + 7k + 6]Now, let's compute the right side for (n = k + 1):[(k + 2)(2k + 3) = k(2k + 3) + 2(2k + 3) = 2k^2 + 3k + 4k + 6 = 2k^2 + 7k + 6]Yes, both sides are equal, so the inductive step holds. Therefore, the expression that needs to be added when moving from (n = k) to (n = k + 1) is indeed ((2k + 2) + (2k + 3)), which is option D.But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. When we go from (n = k) to (n = k + 1), the number of terms increases by 2, right? Because (2(k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 3), so we're adding two more terms: (2k + 2) and (2k + 3). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The average age of 3 boys is 15 years and their ages are in proportion 3 : 5 : 7. What is the age in years of the eldest boy?","answer":"First, I need to determine the ages of the three boys based on the given proportion of 3:5:7. To do this, I'll assign a common multiplier, x, to each part of the ratio. This means the ages of the boys can be represented as 3x, 5x, and 7x.Next, I know that the average age of the three boys is 15 years. The average age is calculated by summing all their ages and dividing by the number of boys. So, I'll set up the equation:(3x + 5x + 7x) / 3 = 15Combining the terms in the numerator gives:15x / 3 = 15Simplifying the left side by dividing both terms by 3 results in:5x = 15To find the value of x, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 5:x = 15 / 5x = 3Now that I have the value of x, I can determine the age of the eldest boy, which is represented by 7x:Age of the eldest boy = 7xAge of the eldest boy = 7 * 3Age of the eldest boy = 21Therefore, the age of the eldest boy is 21 years."},{"question":"Find all functions ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) that satisfy for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ):[ f(y-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y)) ]","answer":"Okay, so I have this functional equation to solve: ( f(y - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y)) ) for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ). I need to find all functions ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) that satisfy this condition. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that sometimes plugging in specific values for ( x ) or ( y ) can simplify the equation and give us some useful information about the function ( f ). Maybe I can start by setting ( x = 0 ) or ( y = 0 ) to see what happens.Let me try setting ( x = 0 ). Then the equation becomes:[ f(y - f(0)) = f(0) - 0 + f(f(y)) ]Simplifying, that's:[ f(y - f(0)) = f(0) + f(f(y)) ]Hmm, interesting. I don't know what ( f(0) ) is yet, but maybe I can find it by choosing another value. What if I set ( y = f(0) )? Let's try that.Setting ( y = f(0) ), the original equation becomes:[ f(f(0) - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(f(0))) ]This looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I set ( x = 0 ) here as well, I can find something about ( f(f(f(0))) ).So, setting ( x = 0 ) in this equation:[ f(f(0) - f(0)) = f(0) - 0 + f(f(f(0))) ]Simplifying:[ f(0) = f(0) + f(f(f(0))) ]Subtracting ( f(0) ) from both sides:[ 0 = f(f(f(0))) ]So, ( f(f(f(0))) = 0 ). That's something. Maybe I can use this later.Let me go back to the equation I got when I set ( x = 0 ):[ f(y - f(0)) = f(0) + f(f(y)) ]I wonder if I can find ( f(0) ) by choosing a specific ( y ). Let's try ( y = 0 ).Setting ( y = 0 ) in the original equation:[ f(0 - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(0)) ]Simplifying:[ f(-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(0)) ]Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can relate it to something else.Wait, earlier I found that ( f(f(f(0))) = 0 ). Maybe I can set ( y = f(f(0)) ) in the original equation to see what happens.Setting ( y = f(f(0)) ):[ f(f(f(0)) - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(f(f(0)))) ]But since ( f(f(f(0))) = 0 ), this simplifies to:[ f(0 - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(0) ]Which is:[ f(-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(0) ]Wait a minute, this looks similar to the equation I got when I set ( y = 0 ). Comparing the two:1. From ( y = 0 ): ( f(-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(0)) )2. From ( y = f(f(0)) ): ( f(-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(0) )So, setting these equal to each other:[ f(x) - 2x + f(f(0)) = f(x) - 2x + f(0) ]Subtracting ( f(x) - 2x ) from both sides:[ f(f(0)) = f(0) ]So, ( f(f(0)) = f(0) ). That's a useful piece of information.Earlier, I found that ( f(f(f(0))) = 0 ). Since ( f(f(0)) = f(0) ), substituting that in:[ f(f(0)) = 0 ]But ( f(f(0)) = f(0) ), so:[ f(0) = 0 ]Great! So, ( f(0) = 0 ). That's a good start.Now, going back to the equation I had when ( x = 0 ):[ f(y - f(0)) = f(0) + f(f(y)) ]Since ( f(0) = 0 ), this simplifies to:[ f(y) = f(f(y)) ]So, ( f(y) = f(f(y)) ) for all ( y ). That means that applying ( f ) twice doesn't change the value. Interesting.What does this tell me about ( f )? Well, if ( f ) is injective (one-to-one), then ( f(y) = f(f(y)) ) would imply ( y = f(y) ). But I don't know yet if ( f ) is injective. Maybe I can prove that ( f ) is injective.To prove injectivity, I need to show that if ( f(a) = f(b) ), then ( a = b ). Let's assume ( f(a) = f(b) ) and see what happens.Starting with the original equation:[ f(y - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y)) ]If I set ( x = a ) and ( x = b ), since ( f(a) = f(b) ), the left-hand side becomes the same:[ f(y - f(a)) = f(y - f(b)) ]Which implies:[ f(a) - 2a + f(f(y)) = f(b) - 2b + f(f(y)) ]Since ( f(a) = f(b) ), subtracting ( f(f(y)) ) from both sides gives:[ f(a) - 2a = f(b) - 2b ]But ( f(a) = f(b) ), so:[ -2a = -2b ]Dividing both sides by -2:[ a = b ]Therefore, ( f ) is injective.Now that I know ( f ) is injective and ( f(y) = f(f(y)) ), I can conclude that ( y = f(y) ) for all ( y ). Because if ( f(y) = f(f(y)) ) and ( f ) is injective, then ( y = f(y) ).So, ( f(y) = y ) for all ( y ). Let me check if this function satisfies the original equation.Substituting ( f(y) = y ) into the original equation:Left-hand side (LHS):[ f(y - f(x)) = f(y - x) = y - x ]Right-hand side (RHS):[ f(x) - 2x + f(f(y)) = x - 2x + y = -x + y ]So, LHS = RHS:[ y - x = y - x ]Which is true. Therefore, ( f(y) = y ) is indeed a solution.I should also check if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose there is another function ( f ) that satisfies the equation. But since we've proven that ( f ) must be injective and ( f(y) = f(f(y)) ), and from injectivity ( f(y) = y ) is the only possibility. So, ( f(y) = y ) is the unique solution.In summary, by setting specific values for ( x ) and ( y ), proving injectivity, and using the properties of the function, I've deduced that the only solution is the identity function."},{"question":"Find the coefficient of (x^9) in the polynomial expansion of [(1+3x-2x^2)^5.](A) 240(B) -240(C) 120(D) -120(E) None of these","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of (x^9) in the expansion of ((1 + 3x - 2x^2)^5). Hmm, this seems like a problem where I can use the multinomial theorem. Let me recall how that works.The multinomial theorem generalizes the binomial theorem for expressions with more than two terms. For a polynomial ((a + b + c)^n), the expansion is given by the sum over all combinations of exponents (k_1, k_2, k_3) such that (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = n), and each term is (frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!k_3!}a^{k_1}b^{k_2}c^{k_3}).In this case, our polynomial is ((1 + 3x - 2x^2)^5), so (a = 1), (b = 3x), and (c = -2x^2), with (n = 5). We need to find the coefficient of (x^9). To get the term with (x^9), we need to consider the exponents of (x) in each part. The term (1) contributes (x^0), (3x) contributes (x^1), and (-2x^2) contributes (x^2). So, if we take (k_1) terms of (1), (k_2) terms of (3x), and (k_3) terms of (-2x^2), the exponent of (x) in that term will be (k_2 + 2k_3). We need this exponent to be 9.So, we have the equation:[k_2 + 2k_3 = 9]and also, since the total number of terms is 5, we have:[k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 5]Our goal is to find all non-negative integer solutions ((k_1, k_2, k_3)) to these equations.Let me solve for (k_1) from the second equation:[k_1 = 5 - k_2 - k_3]Since (k_1) must be non-negative, (5 - k_2 - k_3 geq 0), which implies (k_2 + k_3 leq 5).But from the first equation, (k_2 + 2k_3 = 9). Let me see if this is possible with (k_2 + k_3 leq 5). Let's substitute (k_2 = 9 - 2k_3) into the inequality:[(9 - 2k_3) + k_3 leq 5]Simplify:[9 - k_3 leq 5]Which gives:[-k_3 leq -4 implies k_3 geq 4]So, (k_3) must be at least 4. Let's try (k_3 = 4):[k_2 = 9 - 2(4) = 9 - 8 = 1]Then, (k_1 = 5 - 1 - 4 = 0). So, one solution is (k_1 = 0), (k_2 = 1), (k_3 = 4).Let's check if (k_3 = 5) is possible:[k_2 = 9 - 2(5) = 9 - 10 = -1]But (k_2) can't be negative, so (k_3 = 5) is invalid. Therefore, the only solution is (k_1 = 0), (k_2 = 1), (k_3 = 4).Now, let's compute the coefficient for this term using the multinomial coefficient:[frac{5!}{k_1!k_2!k_3!} = frac{5!}{0!1!4!} = frac{120}{1 cdot 1 cdot 24} = frac{120}{24} = 5]Next, we need to multiply this by the coefficients from each term:[1^{k_1} cdot (3x)^{k_2} cdot (-2x^2)^{k_3} = 1^0 cdot (3x)^1 cdot (-2x^2)^4]Calculating each part:[1^0 = 1][(3x)^1 = 3x][(-2x^2)^4 = (-2)^4 cdot (x^2)^4 = 16x^8]Multiplying these together:[1 cdot 3x cdot 16x^8 = 48x^9]Now, multiply by the multinomial coefficient:[5 cdot 48x^9 = 240x^9]So, the coefficient of (x^9) is 240. Let me double-check if there are any other possible solutions for (k_2 + 2k_3 = 9) with (k_2 + k_3 leq 5). As we saw earlier, (k_3) must be at least 4, and (k_3 = 4) gives (k_2 = 1), which works. (k_3 = 5) gives a negative (k_2), which isn't allowed. So, there are no other solutions.Therefore, the coefficient of (x^9) is indeed 240."},{"question":"Find a such that ax^2 + 18x + 16 is the square of a binomial.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the value of 'a' such that the quadratic expression ( ax^2 + 18x + 16 ) is the square of a binomial. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a binomial squared looks like ( (rx + s)^2 ), where 'r' and 's' are constants. When I expand this, it should give me a quadratic expression. Let me write that out:( (rx + s)^2 = r^2x^2 + 2rsx + s^2 ).So, if ( ax^2 + 18x + 16 ) is equal to this squared binomial, then their corresponding coefficients must be equal. That means:1. The coefficient of ( x^2 ) in the binomial square is ( r^2 ), so ( r^2 = a ).2. The coefficient of 'x' is ( 2rs ), which should equal 18.3. The constant term is ( s^2 ), which should equal 16.Alright, so let's tackle these one by one.Starting with the constant term: ( s^2 = 16 ). To find 's', I take the square root of both sides. Remember, square roots can be positive or negative, so ( s = 4 ) or ( s = -4 ). I'll keep both possibilities in mind for now.Next, let's look at the middle term: ( 2rs = 18 ). I can solve for 'r' if I know 's'. Let's consider both cases for 's'.Case 1: ( s = 4 )Plugging into ( 2rs = 18 ):( 2r(4) = 18 )Simplify:( 8r = 18 )Divide both sides by 8:( r = frac{18}{8} = frac{9}{4} ).Case 2: ( s = -4 )Plugging into ( 2rs = 18 ):( 2r(-4) = 18 )Simplify:( -8r = 18 )Divide both sides by -8:( r = frac{18}{-8} = -frac{9}{4} ).So, depending on the value of 's', we have two possible values for 'r': ( frac{9}{4} ) and ( -frac{9}{4} ).Now, let's find 'a' using the first equation ( r^2 = a ).Case 1: ( r = frac{9}{4} )( a = left( frac{9}{4} right)^2 = frac{81}{16} ).Case 2: ( r = -frac{9}{4} )( a = left( -frac{9}{4} right)^2 = frac{81}{16} ).Wait, interesting! Both cases give the same value for 'a'. That makes sense because when you square a negative number, it becomes positive. So regardless of whether 'r' is positive or negative, 'a' ends up being the same.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify by plugging these values back into the original expression.Let's take ( a = frac{81}{16} ), ( r = frac{9}{4} ), and ( s = 4 ). Then the binomial squared is:( left( frac{9}{4}x + 4 right)^2 ).Expanding this:First, square ( frac{9}{4}x ): ( left( frac{9}{4}x right)^2 = frac{81}{16}x^2 ).Then, the middle term: ( 2 times frac{9}{4}x times 4 = 2 times frac{9}{4} times 4 x = 2 times 9 x = 18x ).Finally, the constant term: ( 4^2 = 16 ).Putting it all together: ( frac{81}{16}x^2 + 18x + 16 ), which matches the original expression. Perfect!Just to be thorough, let me check the other case where ( r = -frac{9}{4} ) and ( s = -4 ). The binomial would be ( left( -frac{9}{4}x - 4 right)^2 ).Expanding this:First term: ( left( -frac{9}{4}x right)^2 = frac{81}{16}x^2 ).Middle term: ( 2 times -frac{9}{4}x times -4 = 2 times frac{36}{4}x = 2 times 9x = 18x ).Constant term: ( (-4)^2 = 16 ).Again, we get ( frac{81}{16}x^2 + 18x + 16 ). So both cases work, which confirms that 'a' must be ( frac{81}{16} ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both cases for 's' lead to the same value of 'a'. So, I'm confident that ( a = frac{81}{16} ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{dfrac{81}{16}}."},{"question":"Solve[arctan frac{1}{x} + arctan frac{1}{x^3} = frac{pi}{4}.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: arctan(1/x) + arctan(1/x³) = π/4. Hmm, arctan functions... I remember that sometimes you can use the tangent addition formula to solve equations involving arctan. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that if I have arctan(a) + arctan(b), I can use the formula tan(arctan(a) + arctan(b)) = (a + b)/(1 - ab), provided that 1 - ab ≠ 0. So maybe I can apply that here.Let me set A = arctan(1/x) and B = arctan(1/x³). Then the equation becomes A + B = π/4. If I take the tangent of both sides, I get tan(A + B) = tan(π/4). Since tan(π/4) is 1, that gives me tan(A + B) = 1.Using the tangent addition formula, tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). Substituting tan A = 1/x and tan B = 1/x³, I get:(1/x + 1/x³) / (1 - (1/x)(1/x³)) = 1.Let me simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is (1/x + 1/x³). To combine these, I can write them with a common denominator, which is x³:( x² + 1 ) / x³.The denominator of the big fraction is 1 - (1/x)(1/x³) = 1 - 1/x⁴. So the denominator is (x⁴ - 1)/x⁴.Putting it all together, the fraction becomes:( (x² + 1)/x³ ) / ( (x⁴ - 1)/x⁴ ) = (x² + 1)/x³ * x⁴/(x⁴ - 1) = (x² + 1)x / (x⁴ - 1).So, (x² + 1)x / (x⁴ - 1) = 1.Now, I can write this as:x(x² + 1) = x⁴ - 1.Expanding the left side: x³ + x = x⁴ - 1.Bringing all terms to one side: x⁴ - x³ - x - 1 = 0.Hmm, so I have a quartic equation: x⁴ - x³ - x - 1 = 0. Quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this.Let me try factoring by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:(x⁴ - x³) + (-x - 1) = 0.Factor out x³ from the first group: x³(x - 1) -1(x + 1) = 0.Wait, that doesn't seem to factor neatly. Maybe I made a mistake in grouping. Let me try a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as a quadratic in terms of x². Let me see:x⁴ - x³ - x - 1 = 0.Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, since the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 1.Let me test x = 1: 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -2 ≠ 0.x = -1: 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 2 ≠ 0.So no rational roots. Maybe I can factor it as (x² + ax + b)(x² + cx + d).Let me attempt to factor it:(x² + ax + b)(x² + cx + d) = x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + bd.Comparing coefficients with x⁴ - x³ - x - 1:- Coefficient of x⁴: 1 = 1, okay.- Coefficient of x³: a + c = -1.- Coefficient of x²: ac + b + d = 0 (since there's no x² term in the original equation).- Coefficient of x: ad + bc = -1.- Constant term: bd = -1.So, we have a system of equations:1. a + c = -12. ac + b + d = 03. ad + bc = -14. bd = -1Let me think about possible integer solutions for b and d such that bd = -1. The possibilities are (b, d) = (1, -1) or (-1, 1).Let me try b = 1 and d = -1.Then, equation 2 becomes ac + 1 - 1 = ac = 0. So, ac = 0.From equation 1, a + c = -1.If ac = 0, then either a = 0 or c = 0.Case 1: a = 0. Then c = -1.Now, equation 3: ad + bc = 0*(-1) + (-1)*1 = -1. Which matches equation 3: -1 = -1. So this works.So, we have a = 0, c = -1, b = 1, d = -1.Therefore, the quartic factors as (x² + 0x + 1)(x² - x -1) = (x² + 1)(x² - x -1).So, x⁴ - x³ - x -1 = (x² + 1)(x² - x -1).Now, set each factor equal to zero:1. x² + 1 = 0 → x² = -1. No real solutions here.2. x² - x -1 = 0. Using quadratic formula: x = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2.So, the real solutions are x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 and x = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.But wait, I need to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes when we take tangents and manipulate equations, we might introduce extraneous solutions.Let me check x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let's compute arctan(1/x) + arctan(1/x³).First, compute x: (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618.So, 1/x ≈ 0.618, and 1/x³ ≈ 1/(1.618³) ≈ 1/4.236 ≈ 0.236.Now, arctan(0.618) is approximately 0.555 radians, and arctan(0.236) is approximately 0.232 radians.Adding them together: 0.555 + 0.232 ≈ 0.787 radians. Now, π/4 is approximately 0.785 radians. So, it's very close. Considering rounding errors, this seems to be a valid solution.Now, check x = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Compute x: (1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ (-1.236)/2 ≈ -0.618.So, 1/x ≈ -1.618, and 1/x³ ≈ 1/(-0.618³) ≈ 1/(-0.236) ≈ -4.236.Now, arctan(-1.618) is negative, and arctan(-4.236) is also negative. Adding two negative angles would give a negative angle, but the right side of the equation is π/4, which is positive. So, this solution doesn't satisfy the original equation.Therefore, the only valid solution is x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for x = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign.If x is negative, then 1/x is negative, and 1/x³ is also negative. So, arctan(1/x) and arctan(1/x³) would both be negative angles. Adding two negative angles would give a negative angle, which cannot equal π/4, a positive angle. So, yes, x = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 is not a valid solution.Therefore, the only solution is x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.I think that's it. So, the solution is x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2."},{"question":"For the main course, four teams were asked to prepare 500 pieces of fish fillets within a deadline of 3 hours. The first team completed 189 pieces in 1 hour, and the second team completed 131 pieces in 1.5 hours. The third team has a production rate of 45 fish fillets per hour. Considering the remaining time left and the additional fish fillets needed, calculate the required increased production rate for the fourth team to meet the deadline.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about four teams preparing fish fillets for a main course. The goal is to make 500 pieces within 3 hours. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.First, there are four teams, and they need to make a total of 500 fish fillets. The deadline is 3 hours, so they have to finish everything by then. Now, the first team has already completed 189 pieces in 1 hour. That seems pretty good. The second team did 131 pieces in 1.5 hours. Hmm, that's a bit slower than the first team. The third team has a production rate of 45 fish fillets per hour. Okay, so they haven't started yet, but they can make 45 pieces every hour.Now, the question is about the fourth team. We need to find out what increased production rate they need to meet the deadline. So, I guess I need to calculate how many fish fillets are already done and how many are still needed, and then see how much the fourth team has to contribute in the remaining time.Let me start by adding up what the first two teams have done. The first team did 189 pieces, and the second team did 131 pieces. So, 189 plus 131 is 320 pieces. Okay, so together, they've made 320 pieces.Now, the third team has a rate of 45 fillets per hour. But how much time do they have left? The first team took 1 hour, and the second team took 1.5 hours. So, total time used so far is 1 plus 1.5, which is 2.5 hours. The deadline is 3 hours, so there's 0.5 hours left, which is 30 minutes.If the third team can make 45 fillets per hour, then in half an hour, they can make half of that, which is 22.5 fillets. But you can't have half a fillet, so maybe they can make 22 fillets in that time.So, adding the third team's contribution, the total number of fillets made by the first three teams is 320 plus 22, which is 342 fillets.The total needed is 500 fillets, so the fourth team needs to make up the difference. That would be 500 minus 342, which is 158 fillets.Now, the fourth team has the same 0.5 hours left to make these 158 fillets. To find out the required production rate, I need to divide the number of fillets they need to make by the time they have.So, 158 fillets divided by 0.5 hours is 316 fillets per hour.Wait, that seems really high. Is that possible? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.Let me double-check my calculations. The first team did 189, the second did 131, so together that's 320. The third team can do 45 per hour, so in half an hour, that's 22.5, which I rounded down to 22. So, total is 342. Subtracting that from 500 gives 158. Divided by 0.5 hours gives 316 per hour.Hmm, maybe that's correct. If the fourth team needs to make up 158 fillets in half an hour, they need to work really fast. I guess that's the answer.But just to be sure, let me think about it another way. If all four teams were working together, how much would they need to produce per hour?Total needed is 500 fillets in 3 hours, so that's about 166.67 fillets per hour.But the first team is already doing 189 in the first hour, which is more than the required rate. The second team is doing 131 in 1.5 hours, which averages to about 87.33 per hour. The third team is doing 45 per hour.So, adding up the rates: 189 per hour (first team) plus 87.33 per hour (second team) plus 45 per hour (third team) is 321.33 per hour.Wait, that's way more than the required 166.67 per hour. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong.I think I confused the total production with the rates. Maybe I should be looking at the total production over the 3 hours instead of adding up the rates.Let me try that again.First team: 189 fillets in 1 hour.Second team: 131 fillets in 1.5 hours.Third team: 45 fillets per hour for the remaining time.Fourth team: ?Total time is 3 hours.First team took 1 hour, second took 1.5 hours, so total time used is 2.5 hours, leaving 0.5 hours.So, the third team can work for 0.5 hours at 45 per hour, making 22.5 fillets.Fourth team also has 0.5 hours to make the remaining fillets.Total fillets needed: 500.Fillets made by first team: 189.Fillets made by second team: 131.Fillets made by third team: 22.5.Total made: 189 + 131 + 22.5 = 342.5.Remaining fillets: 500 - 342.5 = 157.5.Fourth team needs to make 157.5 fillets in 0.5 hours.So, their required rate is 157.5 / 0.5 = 315 fillets per hour.Wait, earlier I got 316, now I'm getting 315. The difference is because I rounded down the third team's contribution.If I keep it at 22.5, then 500 - 342.5 = 157.5.157.5 divided by 0.5 is 315.So, maybe the answer is 315 fillets per hour.But earlier, I thought 316. It depends on whether we round up or down.But since you can't make half a fillet, maybe it's better to round up to ensure the target is met.So, 316 fillets per hour.Yeah, I think that's the answer."},{"question":"For (a, b, n geq 2) such that (operatorname{gcd}(a, b) = 1), show that (operatorname{gcd}left(frac{a^{n} - b^{n}}{a - b}, a - bright) = operatorname{gcd}(a - b, n)).","answer":"Okay, so I need to show that for (a, b, n geq 2) with (operatorname{gcd}(a, b) = 1), the greatest common divisor of (frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}) and (a - b) is equal to the greatest common divisor of (a - b) and (n). Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let's break it down step by step.First, I remember that (frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}) can be expanded using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. So, that expression should be equal to (a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}). Let me write that down:[frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b} = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}]Okay, so now I have this sum. I need to find the gcd of this sum and (a - b). Maybe I can look at this sum modulo (a - b). If I can find what this sum is congruent to modulo (a - b), that might help me figure out the gcd.Since (a equiv b pmod{a - b}), I can substitute (a) with (b) in the sum. Let's try that:[a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1} equiv b^{n-1} + b^{n-2}b + cdots + bb^{n-2} + b^{n-1} pmod{a - b}]Simplifying each term, since (b^{n-1} = b^{n-1}), (b^{n-2}b = b^{n-1}), and so on, each term becomes (b^{n-1}). There are (n) terms in total, so the sum becomes:[n cdot b^{n-1} pmod{a - b}]So, we have:[frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b} equiv n cdot b^{n-1} pmod{a - b}]Now, the gcd of (frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}) and (a - b) is the same as the gcd of (n cdot b^{n-1}) and (a - b). Let's denote this gcd as (d). So,[d = operatorname{gcd}left(n cdot b^{n-1}, a - bright)]Since (d) divides both (n cdot b^{n-1}) and (a - b), it must also divide any linear combination of these two. In particular, (d) divides (n cdot b^{n-1}) and (a - b). But we know that (operatorname{gcd}(a, b) = 1), which might be useful here.Wait, if (d) divides (a - b), then it also divides (a), because (a = (a - b) + b). But since (operatorname{gcd}(a, b) = 1), any common divisor of (a) and (b) must be 1. Therefore, (d) must divide (n) because (d) divides (n cdot b^{n-1}) and cannot share any common factors with (b^{n-1}).So, (d) divides both (n) and (a - b), which means that (d) is a common divisor of (n) and (a - b). Conversely, any common divisor of (n) and (a - b) will also divide (n cdot b^{n-1}) and (a - b), so it will divide (d). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (d) must be equal to (operatorname{gcd}(n, a - b)).Putting it all together, we've shown that:[operatorname{gcd}left(frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}, a - bright) = operatorname{gcd}(a - b, n)]I think that makes sense. I used the fact that (a equiv b pmod{a - b}) to simplify the expression modulo (a - b), and then leveraged the properties of gcd to show that the gcd in question reduces to (operatorname{gcd}(a - b, n)). I should probably double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the modular arithmetic and the properties of gcd.Let me recap:1. Expanded (frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}) into a sum.2. Evaluated the sum modulo (a - b) by substituting (a) with (b).3. Found that the sum is congruent to (n cdot b^{n-1}) modulo (a - b).4. Noted that the gcd of the sum and (a - b) is the same as the gcd of (n cdot b^{n-1}) and (a - b).5. Argued that any common divisor must divide both (n) and (a - b), hence the gcd is (operatorname{gcd}(n, a - b)).Everything seems to check out. I think I've successfully proven the statement."},{"question":"In a group of ducks and cows, the total number of legs are 24 more than twice the number of heads. Find the total number of buffaloes.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of buffaloes in the group based on the given information about ducks and cows.I'll start by defining variables for the number of ducks (D) and cows (C). Ducks have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of heads is the sum of ducks and cows, which is D + C.According to the problem, the total number of legs is 24 more than twice the number of heads. This can be written as the equation:2D + 4C = 2(D + C) + 24Simplifying the equation:2D + 4C = 2D + 2C + 24Subtracting 2D from both sides:4C = 2C + 24Subtracting 2C from both sides:2C = 24Dividing both sides by 2:C = 12So, there are 12 cows. Since the question was about the number of buffaloes and assuming that was a mistake and you meant cows, the answer is 12 cows. If you actually meant buffaloes and they were not part of the original group of animals, then the answer would be 0 buffaloes."},{"question":"The equation of the tangent line to the function f(x) = (x + 1)ln x - 4(x - 1) at the point (1, f(1)) is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I need to find the equation of the tangent line to the function ( f(x) = (x + 1)ln x - 4(x - 1) ) at the point ( (1, f(1)) ). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. I remember that to find the tangent line at a particular point, I need two things: the slope of the tangent line at that point and a point through which the tangent line passes. In this case, the point is given as ( (1, f(1)) ), so I need to find ( f(1) ) first.Let me start by calculating ( f(1) ). Plugging ( x = 1 ) into the function:( f(1) = (1 + 1)ln 1 - 4(1 - 1) )I know that ( ln 1 = 0 ), so this simplifies to:( f(1) = 2 times 0 - 4 times 0 = 0 )So, the point is ( (1, 0) ). Got that down.Next, I need to find the slope of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ). The slope of the tangent line at a point is given by the derivative of the function evaluated at that point. So, I need to find ( f'(x) ) and then plug in ( x = 1 ).Let's compute the derivative ( f'(x) ). The function is ( f(x) = (x + 1)ln x - 4(x - 1) ). To differentiate this, I'll use the product rule for the first term and the power rule for the second term.First, let's differentiate ( (x + 1)ln x ). Using the product rule, which states that ( frac{d}{dx}[u cdot v] = u'v + uv' ), where ( u = x + 1 ) and ( v = ln x ).So, ( u' = 1 ) (since the derivative of ( x + 1 ) is 1), and ( v' = frac{1}{x} ) (since the derivative of ( ln x ) is ( frac{1}{x} )).Putting it all together:( frac{d}{dx}[(x + 1)ln x] = (1)(ln x) + (x + 1)left(frac{1}{x}right) )Simplify that:( ln x + frac{x + 1}{x} )Okay, that's the derivative of the first part.Now, for the second part of the function, ( -4(x - 1) ). The derivative of this is straightforward. The derivative of ( x ) is 1, so:( frac{d}{dx}[-4(x - 1)] = -4(1) = -4 )So, combining both parts, the derivative ( f'(x) ) is:( f'(x) = ln x + frac{x + 1}{x} - 4 )Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at ( x = 1 ) to find the slope of the tangent line at that point.Plugging ( x = 1 ) into ( f'(x) ):( f'(1) = ln 1 + frac{1 + 1}{1} - 4 )Again, ( ln 1 = 0 ), so:( f'(1) = 0 + frac{2}{1} - 4 = 0 + 2 - 4 = -2 )So, the slope ( m ) of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ) is ( -2 ).Now that I have the slope and a point through which the tangent line passes, I can write the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form. The point-slope form of a line is:( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) )Where ( (x_1, y_1) ) is the point and ( m ) is the slope.Plugging in the values we have:( y - 0 = -2(x - 1) )Simplifying this:( y = -2x + 2 )So, the equation of the tangent line is ( y = -2x + 2 ).Alternatively, if I want to write it in standard form ( Ax + By + C = 0 ), I can rearrange it:( 2x + y - 2 = 0 )Either form is correct, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll go with the slope-intercept form ( y = -2x + 2 ) because it's more straightforward.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, ( f(1) = 0 ) is correct because ( ln 1 = 0 ) and ( 4(0) = 0 ).Next, the derivative:( f'(x) = ln x + frac{x + 1}{x} - 4 )At ( x = 1 ):( ln 1 = 0 ), ( frac{1 + 1}{1} = 2 ), so ( 0 + 2 - 4 = -2 ). That seems right.Using point-slope form:( y - 0 = -2(x - 1) ) simplifies to ( y = -2x + 2 ). Yep, that looks correct.So, I think I've got it right. The tangent line at ( (1, 0) ) with slope ( -2 ) is ( y = -2x + 2 ).**Final Answer**The equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = -2x + 2}."},{"question":"Given that a hyperbola passes through the point (2sqrt{2},1), and one of its asymptote equations is y=frac{1}{2}x, then the standard equation of this hyperbola is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the standard equation of a hyperbola that passes through the point (2√2, 1), and one of its asymptotes is given as y = (1/2)x. Hmm, hyperbolas can be a bit tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola depends on whether it opens horizontally or vertically. Since the asymptote is given as y = (1/2)x, which is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1/2, I think this might indicate that the hyperbola is centered at the origin. If that's the case, the standard form would either be (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1 for a horizontally opening hyperbola or (y²/b²) - (x²/a²) = 1 for a vertically opening one.Now, the asymptotes of a hyperbola are lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. For a horizontally opening hyperbola, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x, and for a vertically opening one, they are y = ±(a/b)x. Given that one of the asymptotes is y = (1/2)x, I can use this information to find the relationship between a and b.Let me assume it's a horizontally opening hyperbola first because the asymptote has a positive slope, which is typical for that orientation. So, if the asymptote is y = (1/2)x, then (b/a) should equal 1/2. That gives me b = (1/2)a. Okay, so b is half of a. That's useful.Now, the standard equation would be (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1. Since I know that b = (1/2)a, I can substitute that into the equation. Let's do that:(x²/a²) - (y²/((1/2)a)²) = 1Simplifying the denominator in the y-term:(x²/a²) - (y²/( (1/4)a² )) = 1Which simplifies further to:(x²/a²) - (4y²/a²) = 1I can factor out 1/a²:( x² - 4y² ) / a² = 1So, x² - 4y² = a²Now, the hyperbola passes through the point (2√2, 1). Let me plug this point into the equation to find a².Substituting x = 2√2 and y = 1:( (2√2)² ) - 4*(1)² = a²Calculating (2√2)²:2√2 squared is (2)^2*(√2)^2 = 4*2 = 8So, 8 - 4*1 = a²Which is 8 - 4 = 4Therefore, a² = 4So, a = 2 (since a is positive in the standard form)Now, since b = (1/2)a, and a is 2, then b = (1/2)*2 = 1So, b = 1Now, plugging a² and b² back into the standard equation:(x²/4) - (y²/1) = 1Simplifying:x²/4 - y² = 1Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I assumed it's a horizontally opening hyperbola because the asymptote has a positive slope. That seems correct.2. The asymptote slope is 1/2, so b/a = 1/2, leading to b = (1/2)a. That makes sense.3. Substituted b into the standard equation and simplified to x² - 4y² = a². That looks right.4. Plugged in the point (2√2, 1):(2√2)^2 = 8, 4*(1)^2 = 4, so 8 - 4 = 4, which equals a². So, a² = 4, a = 2. Correct.5. Then, b = (1/2)*2 = 1. So, b² = 1. Plugging back into the standard equation: x²/4 - y² = 1. That seems consistent.Let me just verify if this hyperbola actually has the asymptote y = (1/2)x.For the standard hyperbola x²/4 - y² = 1, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x = ±(1/2)x. Yes, that matches the given asymptote y = (1/2)x. So, that checks out.Also, plugging the point (2√2, 1) into the equation:( (2√2)^2 ) /4 - (1)^2 = (8)/4 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Which satisfies the equation. So, that point is indeed on the hyperbola.Therefore, I think I've arrived at the correct standard equation of the hyperbola.**Final Answer**The standard equation of the hyperbola is boxed{dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1}."},{"question":"In a sequence, 1 = 6, 2 = 12, 3 = 18, 4 = some value, and 5 = 30. If the sequence follows the pattern that 6 = 1, what is the value of 4 in this sequence?","answer":"Alright, let's try to figure out this sequence problem. So, we have:1 = 62 = 123 = 184 = ?5 = 30And it's mentioned that 6 = 1. Hmm, that's interesting. At first glance, it seems like each number is being multiplied by 6 to get the corresponding value. Let's check that:1 * 6 = 62 * 6 = 123 * 6 = 185 * 6 = 30Okay, that works for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5. So, following this pattern, 4 should be 4 * 6 = 24. That seems straightforward.But then there's this part that says 6 = 1. That doesn't fit the pattern we've been following. If 6 is supposed to equal 1, it breaks the multiplication by 6 rule. Maybe there's another pattern or rule that applies after a certain point. Perhaps the sequence resets or cycles after a specific number.Let's think about cycles. If we consider that after 5, the sequence resets, then 6 would go back to 1. So, maybe the sequence is cyclic with a cycle length of 5. That would mean:1 = 62 = 123 = 184 = 245 = 306 = 17 = 68 = 12And so on. In this case, 6 corresponds back to 1, which fits the given information.But wait, if that's the case, then the value of 4 would still be 24, as it's within the first cycle. The reset happens at 6, which is outside the numbers we're focusing on (1 to 5). So, the initial pattern holds for 1 to 5, and 6 is a special case where it resets to 1.Alternatively, maybe there's a different operation happening at 6. Perhaps instead of multiplying by 6, there's a division or some other mathematical operation. If 6 = 1, then 6 divided by 6 equals 1. That could be another way to look at it.But then, applying that to the other numbers:1 = 6 (1 * 6)2 = 12 (2 * 6)3 = 18 (3 * 6)4 = ? (4 * 6 = 24)5 = 30 (5 * 6)6 = 1 (6 / 6 = 1)This seems inconsistent because the operation changes from multiplication to division at 6. It would be unusual for a sequence to change its rule like that without any indication.Maybe there's a different pattern altogether. Let's see if there's a connection between the numbers and their corresponding values that isn't simply multiplication by 6.Looking at the numbers:1 = 62 = 123 = 185 = 30If we list these out:1:62:123:185:30It seems like each number is being multiplied by 6, but 4 is missing. If we follow the pattern, 4 should be 24. But then 6 = 1 breaks this pattern.Perhaps the sequence is not purely mathematical but involves some other logic, like counting letters or something else. For example, \\"one\\" has three letters, but 1 corresponds to 6. That doesn't seem to fit.Alternatively, maybe it's related to factors or multiples. Let's see:6 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, and 6.12 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.18 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.30 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.But I'm not sure how this connects to the sequence.Another thought: Maybe it's related to the sum of the digits or some other digit manipulation.For example:1:6 (1 * 6 = 6)2:12 (2 * 6 = 12)3:18 (3 * 6 = 18)4:24 (4 * 6 = 24)5:30 (5 * 6 = 30)6:1 (6 / 6 = 1)This brings us back to the initial idea that the sequence follows multiplication by 6, except for 6, which is divided by 6 to get back to 1.But again, this seems inconsistent because the operation changes at 6.Maybe there's a modular arithmetic aspect to it. For example, modulo 5:6 mod 5 = 112 mod 5 = 218 mod 5 = 324 mod 5 = 430 mod 5 = 0But that doesn't seem to align with the given sequence.Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is counting something in a circular manner, like days of the week or months of the year, but that doesn't quite fit either.Another angle: Maybe the numbers represent positions in a word or something similar. For example, \\"SIX\\" has three letters, but 1 corresponds to 6. Not sure.Wait, if we think of 6 as the result of 1 multiplied by 6, then 6 could represent the end of a cycle, and 1 starts a new cycle. So, 6 = 1 could mean that after 6, it cycles back to 1.In that case, the sequence would be:1:62:123:184:245:306:1 (start of a new cycle)So, 4 would still be 24, and 6 would reset to 1.This seems plausible, with the sequence cycling every 5 numbers, resetting at 6.But to confirm, let's see if this holds:If we continue the sequence:7:68:129:1810:2411:3012:1And so on.Yes, this pattern makes sense, with each cycle of 5 numbers corresponding to multiples of 6, and then resetting to 1 at the 6th number.Therefore, in the given sequence, 4 corresponds to 24.So, the value of 4 in this sequence is 24."},{"question":"Let a be an irrational number, and a, b satisfy ab + a - b = 1, then b = .","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given that ( a ) is an irrational number, and ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy the equation ( ab + a - b = 1 ). I need to find the value of ( b ). Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it correctly: ( ab + a - b = 1 ). I need to solve for ( b ). Since ( a ) is irrational, that might play a role in the solution, but I'm not entirely sure how yet. Maybe it affects the possible values ( b ) can take?Let me try to rearrange the equation to isolate ( b ). So, starting with ( ab + a - b = 1 ). I can factor out ( b ) from the first and third terms: ( b(a - 1) + a = 1 ). Hmm, that looks a bit better. So, ( b(a - 1) = 1 - a ). Wait, that's interesting.

Hmm, so both sides have a factor of ( (a - 1) ). If ( (a - 1) ) is not zero, I can divide both sides by ( (a - 1) ) to solve for ( b ). Let's see: ( b = frac{-(a - 1)}{a - 1} ). Simplifying that, the ( (a - 1) ) terms cancel out, leaving ( b = -1 ). But wait, before I get too excited, I need to consider the case where ( (a - 1) ) is zero. If ( a - 1 = 0 ), then ( a = 1 ). But hold on, the problem states that ( a ) is irrational. Is 1 an irrational number? No, 1 is a rational number because it can be expressed as ( frac{1}{1} ). So, ( a ) cannot be 1 because it's given as irrational. Therefore, ( a - 1 ) cannot be zero, which means we're safe to divide both sides by ( (a - 1) ) without any issues.So, going back, since ( a ) is irrational and cannot be 1, ( (a - 1) ) is not zero, and thus ( b = -1 ) is the only solution. Let me double-check that by plugging ( b = -1 ) back into the original equation to make sure it works.Substituting ( b = -1 ) into ( ab + a - b = 1 ), we get ( a(-1) + a - (-1) = 1 ). Simplifying that: ( -a + a + 1 = 1 ). The ( -a ) and ( +a ) cancel each other out, leaving ( 1 = 1 ), which is true. So, that checks out.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my algebra, let me go through the steps again. Starting with ( ab + a - b = 1 ), I factored ( b ) out of the first and third terms to get ( b(a - 1) + a = 1 ). Then, I moved the ( a ) to the other side to get ( b(a - 1) = 1 - a ). Recognizing that ( 1 - a ) is the same as ( -(a - 1) ), I rewrote the equation as ( b(a - 1) = -(a - 1) ). Since ( a ) is irrational and not equal to 1, ( (a - 1) ) is not zero, so I can divide both sides by ( (a - 1) ), resulting in ( b = -1 ). Yep, that seems solid.I was a bit concerned initially about dividing by ( (a - 1) ) because if ( a = 1 ), that would be dividing by zero, which is undefined. But since ( a ) is irrational, it can't be 1, so that case is already excluded. Therefore, ( b = -1 ) is the only valid solution.Another way to approach this problem might be to express ( b ) in terms of ( a ) directly. Let's try that method as a cross-check. Starting again with ( ab + a - b = 1 ), I can collect like terms involving ( b ). So, ( ab - b = 1 - a ). Factoring ( b ) out of the left side gives ( b(a - 1) = 1 - a ). This is the same equation I had before, so solving for ( b ) gives ( b = frac{1 - a}{a - 1} ). Simplifying the fraction, ( frac{1 - a}{a - 1} ) is equal to ( -1 ) because ( 1 - a = -(a - 1) ). So, ( b = -1 ). This confirms my earlier result. It's always good to verify the solution using a different method to ensure that it's correct. Both approaches led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that ( b = -1 ) is indeed the correct solution.Just to cover all bases, let me consider if there's any other possible solution. Suppose ( b ) wasn't equal to -1, could there be another value that satisfies the equation? Let's assume ( b ) is something else, say ( b = k ), where ( k ) is not equal to -1. Then, plugging into the equation: ( a k + a - k = 1 ). Rearranging, ( a(k + 1) = 1 + k ). Then, ( a = frac{1 + k}{k + 1} ). Simplifying, ( a = 1 ). But wait, ( a = 1 ) is rational, which contradicts the given that ( a ) is irrational. Therefore, the only possible value for ( b ) that doesn't force ( a ) to be rational is ( b = -1 ). This reasoning further solidifies that ( b = -1 ) is the only valid solution. It's interesting because it shows how the condition that ( a ) is irrational restricts ( b ) to a specific value. If ( a ) were allowed to be rational, there might be multiple solutions for ( b ), but since ( a ) must be irrational, ( b ) has to be -1 to prevent ( a ) from becoming rational.In summary, by manipulating the original equation, factoring, and considering the constraints given (that ( a ) is irrational), I arrived at the conclusion that ( b = -1 ). Multiple methods and checks confirm this result, so I'm confident it's correct.**Final Answer**The value of ( b ) is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"Given the expressions (-2a)^6(-3a^3)+[2a^2]^3 div frac{1}{ frac{1}{ (-2)^2 3^2 (xy)^3 } } and |-frac{1}{8}|+(pi^3)+(-frac{1}{2}^3-(frac{1}{3})^2), compute their respective values.","answer":"Okay, so I've got these two expressions to evaluate, and I need to figure out their values step by step. Let me start with the first one:First expression: (-2a)^6 * (-3a^3) + [2a^2]^3 ÷ [1 / (1 / ((-2)^2 * 3^2 * (xy)^3))]Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down piece by piece.Starting with (-2a)^6. I know that when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. So, (-2)^6 times a^6. Since (-2)^6 is positive because any even power of a negative number is positive, that would be 64a^6.Next, multiplying that by (-3a^3). So, 64a^6 times (-3a^3). Multiplying the coefficients: 64 * (-3) is -192. Then, multiplying the variables: a^6 * a^3 is a^(6+3) = a^9. So, that part simplifies to -192a^9.Now, moving on to the second part: [2a^2]^3. Again, raising a product to a power, so 2^3 times (a^2)^3. 2^3 is 8, and (a^2)^3 is a^(2*3) = a^6. So, that simplifies to 8a^6.Next, we have division by [1 / (1 / ((-2)^2 * 3^2 * (xy)^3))]. Let me simplify the denominator first: (-2)^2 is 4, 3^2 is 9, and (xy)^3 is x^3y^3. So, multiplying those together: 4 * 9 = 36, and then times x^3y^3, so 36x^3y^3.But wait, the denominator is 1 divided by that, so 1 / (36x^3y^3). Then, we're dividing by that, which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, 8a^6 divided by [1 / (36x^3y^3)] is 8a^6 * 36x^3y^3.Multiplying those together: 8 * 36 is 288, and a^6 * x^3y^3 is a^6x^3y^3. So, that part simplifies to 288a^6x^3y^3.Now, putting it all together: the first part was -192a^9, and the second part is +288a^6x^3y^3. So, the entire first expression simplifies to -192a^9 + 288a^6x^3y^3.Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from (-2a)^6, which is indeed 64a^6. Multiplying by (-3a^3) gives -192a^9. Then, [2a^2]^3 is 8a^6. Dividing by [1 / (1 / (36x^3y^3))] is the same as multiplying by 36x^3y^3, so 8a^6 * 36x^3y^3 is 288a^6x^3y^3. Adding that to -192a^9 gives -192a^9 + 288a^6x^3y^3. Yeah, that seems right.Now, moving on to the second expression: | -1/8 | + (π^3) + (-1/2^3 - (1/3)^2)Let's tackle each part individually.First, | -1/8 |. The absolute value of -1/8 is just 1/8.Next, (π^3) is straightforward; it's just π cubed.Now, the last part: (-1/2^3 - (1/3)^2). I need to be careful with the order of operations here. The exponentiation comes before subtraction.First, 1/2^3. Wait, is that (1/2)^3 or 1/(2^3)? It depends on how it's written. In the original expression, it's written as -1/2^3, which typically means -(1/2)^3. So, that would be - (1/8). Alternatively, if it were (-1/2)^3, it would be -1/8 as well, but since the negative sign is outside, it's the same.Then, (1/3)^2 is 1/9.So, putting it together: -1/8 - 1/9. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 8 and 9 is 72. So, -1/8 is -9/72 and -1/9 is -8/72. Adding those together: -9/72 - 8/72 = -17/72.Now, putting it all together: | -1/8 | + π^3 + (-17/72). That is 1/8 + π^3 - 17/72.To combine the fractions, 1/8 is 9/72, so 9/72 - 17/72 = -8/72, which simplifies to -1/9. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:1/8 is 9/72, and -17/72 is subtracting 17/72. So, 9/72 - 17/72 = -8/72, which simplifies to -1/9. So, the entire expression becomes π^3 - 1/9.Wait, but earlier I thought it was π^3 - 17/72, but after simplifying, it's π^3 - 1/9. Let me verify:1/8 is 9/72, and -17/72 is subtracting 17/72. So, 9/72 - 17/72 = -8/72 = -1/9. Yes, that's correct.So, the second expression simplifies to π^3 - 1/9.Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had -17/72, but after simplifying, it's -1/9. So, the final answer is π^3 - 1/9.Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the exponents. The term was (-1/2^3). If it were (-1/2)^3, it would be -1/8, which is what I used. If it were -(1/2^3), it's also -1/8. So, that part is correct.And (1/3)^2 is definitely 1/9. So, subtracting those gives -1/8 - 1/9 = -17/72, which simplifies to -1/9 when combined with the 1/8 from the absolute value. Wait, no, the absolute value is 1/8, and then we have + π^3 + (-17/72). So, 1/8 - 17/72.Converting 1/8 to 9/72, so 9/72 - 17/72 = -8/72 = -1/9. So, yes, π^3 - 1/9 is correct.Okay, so to summarize:First expression simplifies to -192a^9 + 288a^6x^3y^3.Second expression simplifies to π^3 - 1/9.I think that's it. Let me just write them neatly:First expression: -192a^9 + 288a^6x^3y^3Second expression: π^3 - 1/9I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think these are the correct simplified forms."},{"question":"Dasha cut a rectangular strip of paper into two rectangles: one white and one gray, both of which have integer side lengths. She noted the areas of these two rectangles in her notebook.Then she overlaid the rectangles as shown in the figure. Three new rectangles were formed, and Dasha also noted the areas of these three new rectangles in her notebook.Calculate the length and width of the strip if the sum of all five numbers in Dasha's notebook is 43. Answers can be given in any order.","answer":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Dasha has a rectangular strip of paper that she cuts into two smaller rectangles: one white and one gray. Both of these smaller rectangles have integer side lengths. She notes down their areas. Then, she overlays these two rectangles in some way, forming three new rectangles, and she notes down their areas as well. The sum of all five areas she recorded is 43. We need to find the length and width of the original strip.First, let's try to visualize what's happening. We have a rectangular strip, which means it has two dimensions: length and width. Let's assume the width is the shorter side, and the length is the longer side. Dasha cuts this strip into two smaller rectangles. Let's denote the width of the original strip as 'a'. Then, the length of the original strip would be 'b + c', where 'b' is the length of the white rectangle and 'c' is the length of the gray rectangle. So, the areas of the white and gray rectangles would be 'a*b' and 'a*c', respectively.Now, when Dasha overlays these two rectangles, she forms three new rectangles. I'm assuming that overlaying means placing them on top of each other in some way, possibly overlapping. The problem mentions three new rectangles are formed, and their areas are noted. Let's try to figure out what these new areas could be.If we overlay the two rectangles, the overlapping area would be a smaller rectangle where both the white and gray rectangles cover the same space. The non-overlapping parts would each form their own rectangles. So, perhaps the three new areas are:1. The area of the white rectangle minus the overlapping area.2. The area of the gray rectangle minus the overlapping area.3. The overlapping area itself.But wait, the problem says three new rectangles are formed, not necessarily including the overlapping area. Maybe it's more about the combined figure after overlaying. If we place the two rectangles side by side or on top of each other, the combined figure might form a new rectangle or multiple rectangles.Actually, the problem doesn't specify how the overlaying is done, but since it's mentioned that three new rectangles are formed, I think it's likely that the overlaying is done in such a way that the two smaller rectangles are placed adjacent to each other, forming a larger rectangle with some overlapping or creating three distinct regions.But to avoid confusion, let's think algebraically. Let's denote the width of the original strip as 'a' and the total length as 'b + c'. The areas of the white and gray rectangles are 'a*b' and 'a*c'.When overlaid, the three new rectangles formed might have areas that relate to the original areas. Let's assume that the overlaying process creates three new rectangles with areas that are combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Perhaps the areas are 'a*(b - a)', 'a^2', and 'a*(c - a)'. This is just a guess, but let's see if it fits.So, the total sum of all five areas would be:a*b (white rectangle) + a*c (gray rectangle) + a*(b - a) + a^2 + a*(c - a) = 43Let's simplify this equation:a*b + a*c + a*(b - a) + a^2 + a*(c - a) = 43Expanding the terms:a*b + a*c + a*b - a^2 + a^2 + a*c - a^2 = 43Combine like terms:a*b + a*c + a*b + a*c - a^2 = 43So, 2*a*b + 2*a*c - a^2 = 43Factor out 'a':a*(2*b + 2*c - a) = 43Now, since 43 is a prime number, the factors of 43 are 1 and 43. Therefore, 'a' must be either 1 or 43. However, since 'a' is the width of the original strip, and 'b' and 'c' are lengths of the smaller rectangles, 'a' must be less than 'b + c'. If 'a' were 43, then 'b + c' would have to be greater than 43, but the total sum of areas is only 43, which seems unlikely. Therefore, 'a' is probably 1.So, let's set 'a' = 1:1*(2*b + 2*c - 1) = 43Simplify:2*b + 2*c - 1 = 43Add 1 to both sides:2*b + 2*c = 44Divide both sides by 2:b + c = 22So, the total length of the original strip is 'b + c' = 22, and the width is 'a' = 1. Therefore, the original strip has dimensions 1 and 22.Let me double-check this. If the width is 1, then the areas of the white and gray rectangles are '1*b' and '1*c', which are 'b' and 'c'. The three new areas after overlaying would be '1*(b - 1)', '1^2 = 1', and '1*(c - 1)'. So, the total sum is:b + c + (b - 1) + 1 + (c - 1) = 43Simplify:b + c + b - 1 + 1 + c - 1 = 43Combine like terms:2*b + 2*c - 1 = 43Which matches our earlier equation. Since b + c = 22, then 2*b + 2*c = 44, and 44 - 1 = 43, which checks out.So, the original strip has dimensions 1 and 22."},{"question":"The point P(a,b) in the xy-plane is first rotated counterclockwise by 90^circ around the point (2,3) and then reflected about the line y=x. The image of P after these two transformations ends up at the position (4,1). What is b - a?- **A) 1**- **B) 2**- **C) -1**- **D) 3**","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a point P(a, b) is first rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the point (2, 3), and then it's reflected over the line y = x. After these two transformations, the image ends up at (4, 1). I need to find b - a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that transformations can sometimes be tricky, especially when they're combined. Since the point undergoes two transformations, rotation and reflection, I might need to reverse these steps to find the original point P(a, b). That is, if I start from the final image (4, 1), I can undo the reflection and then undo the rotation to get back to the original point P(a, b). Once I have a and b, I can easily compute b - a.Let me start by recalling what each transformation does. A reflection over the line y = x swaps the x and y coordinates. So, if a point (x, y) is reflected over y = x, it becomes (y, x). That seems straightforward. So, if the final image is (4, 1), then before the reflection, the point must have been (1, 4). Because reflecting (1, 4) over y = x gives (4, 1).Okay, so now I know that after the rotation but before the reflection, the point was (1, 4). Now, I need to figure out what the original point P(a, b) was before the rotation. The rotation was 90 degrees counterclockwise around the point (2, 3). I need to remember how rotation around a point works. Rotating a point (x, y) around another point (h, k) by 90 degrees counterclockwise involves translating the point so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. The formula for rotating a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise around (h, k) is:[(x', y') = (h - (y - k), k + (x - h))]Wait, let me double-check that. If I have a point (x, y) and I want to rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise around (h, k), the steps are:1. Translate the point so that (h, k) becomes the origin: (x - h, y - k).2. Apply the rotation: For 90 degrees counterclockwise, the rotation matrix is (begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1  1 & 0 end{pmatrix}), so the new coordinates become (-(y - k), x - h).3. Translate back by adding (h, k): (h - (y - k), k + (x - h)).Yes, that seems right. So, the formula is:[(x', y') = (h - (y - k), k + (x - h))]In this case, the center of rotation is (2, 3), so h = 2 and k = 3. The point after rotation is (1, 4). So, we can set up the equations:[1 = 2 - (b - 3)][4 = 3 + (a - 2)]Wait, let me make sure I'm setting this up correctly. The point after rotation is (1, 4), which is the result of rotating P(a, b) around (2, 3). So, using the formula:[1 = 2 - (b - 3)][4 = 3 + (a - 2)]Let me solve these equations step by step.Starting with the first equation:[1 = 2 - (b - 3)]Simplify the right side:[1 = 2 - b + 3]Combine like terms:[1 = 5 - b]Subtract 5 from both sides:[1 - 5 = -b][-4 = -b]Multiply both sides by -1:[b = 4]Okay, so b is 4. Now, let's solve the second equation:[4 = 3 + (a - 2)]Simplify the right side:[4 = 3 + a - 2]Combine like terms:[4 = a + 1]Subtract 1 from both sides:[4 - 1 = a][3 = a]So, a is 3. Therefore, the original point P(a, b) is (3, 4). Now, the question asks for b - a. So, let's compute that:[b - a = 4 - 3 = 1]Hmm, so b - a is 1. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started by reflecting the final point (4, 1) over y = x to get (1, 4). That seems correct because reflection over y = x swaps x and y.2. Then, I used the rotation formula to reverse the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation around (2, 3). I translated the point (1, 4) back by subtracting the center, applied the inverse rotation, and then translated back. Wait, actually, I think I might have confused the direction of the rotation when reversing it. Let me think about that.When you rotate a point 90 degrees counterclockwise around a center, to reverse it, you should rotate it 90 degrees clockwise around the same center. Alternatively, you can use the inverse transformation. Let me verify the formula I used.The formula I used was:[(x', y') = (h - (y - k), k + (x - h))]But actually, when reversing a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, which is equivalent to a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation or a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the formula should be different. Let me recall the correct formula for rotating 90 degrees clockwise around (h, k).For a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the formula is:[(x', y') = (h + (y - k), k - (x - h))]Wait, so if I have a point that was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise to become (1, 4), then to reverse it, I should rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. So, using the clockwise formula:[(x, y) = (2 + (4 - 3), 3 - (1 - 2))]Simplify:[x = 2 + (1) = 3][y = 3 - (-1) = 4]So, that gives me (3, 4), which is the same result as before. So, my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, b - a is indeed 1.Just to be thorough, let me apply the transformations forward to confirm. Starting with P(3, 4):1. Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise around (2, 3). Using the counterclockwise formula:[x' = 2 - (4 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1][y' = 3 + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4]So, after rotation, the point is (1, 4).2. Reflect over y = x, which swaps x and y, giving (4, 1). That matches the given final position.Therefore, my answer is correct. b - a is 1."},{"question":"Find the sum of all the solutions to 2^{|x|} + 3|x| = 18.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (2^{|x|} + 3|x| = 18). I need to find the sum of all the solutions to this equation. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that absolute value functions can sometimes make equations a bit tricky because they can have two cases: one where the expression inside is positive and one where it's negative. But in this case, since we're dealing with (|x|), it's symmetric around zero. That means if (x) is a solution, then (-x) is also a solution. So, for every positive solution, there's a corresponding negative solution. If that's the case, then when I add up all the solutions, the positive and negative pairs should cancel each other out, right? For example, if (x = a) is a solution, then (x = -a) is also a solution, and (a + (-a) = 0). So, if there are multiple such pairs, their sum would still be zero. But wait, I should make sure that there are actually solutions. Maybe there's only one solution or no solutions at all? Let me check. Let's consider (x geq 0) because of the absolute value. So, the equation simplifies to (2^{x} + 3x = 18). I need to see if there's a value of (x) that satisfies this. Let me try plugging in some numbers. When (x = 0): (2^{0} + 3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1), which is less than 18. When (x = 1): (2^{1} + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5), still less than 18. When (x = 2): (2^{2} + 3(2) = 4 + 6 = 10), getting closer but not there yet. When (x = 3): (2^{3} + 3(3) = 8 + 9 = 17), almost 18. When (x = 4): (2^{4} + 3(4) = 16 + 12 = 28), which is more than 18. So, somewhere between (x = 3) and (x = 4), the function (2^{x} + 3x) crosses 18. That means there is a solution in that interval. Since the function is continuous and strictly increasing (because both (2^{x}) and (3x) are increasing functions), there must be exactly one solution between 3 and 4. Let's call this solution (a), where (3 < a < 4). Because of the absolute value, the equation is symmetric, so (-a) is also a solution. Therefore, the two solutions are (a) and (-a). Adding these together: (a + (-a) = 0). So, the sum of all solutions is 0. Wait, but what if there's another solution outside this interval? Let me check for (x < 0). But since (|x|) is always positive, it's the same as checking (x > 0). So, no, there aren't any other solutions. Therefore, the sum of all solutions is indeed 0."},{"question":"A large candle is 100 centimeters tall. It is designed with a burn rate increasing over time where the candle takes 5k seconds to burn down the k-th centimeter (from the top). Calculate how tall the candle is, in centimeters, halfway through its total burn time.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a candle that's 100 centimeters tall. The burn rate increases over time, meaning each centimeter takes longer to burn than the previous one. Specifically, the k-th centimeter takes 5k seconds to burn. I need to figure out how tall the candle is halfway through its total burn time.First, I should probably figure out the total burn time of the candle. Since each centimeter takes 5k seconds, where k is the centimeter number from the top, I can sum up the time for each centimeter from 1 to 100. That sounds like an arithmetic series.The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2. So, for 100 centimeters, the sum would be 100*101/2, which is 5050. Then, since each centimeter takes 5k seconds, the total time T is 5 times 5050. Let me calculate that: 5*5050 is 25250 seconds. So, the total burn time is 25,250 seconds.Now, halfway through the total burn time would be 25,250 divided by 2, which is 12,625 seconds. I need to find out how much of the candle has burned down in 12,625 seconds.To do this, I should figure out how many centimeters have been burned down by that time. Let's say m centimeters have been burned down completely by the halfway time. The time taken to burn m centimeters would be the sum of 5k from k=1 to m. That sum is 5*(m(m + 1)/2). So, I need to solve for m in the inequality:5*(m(m + 1)/2) ≤ 12,625 < 5*((m + 1)(m + 2)/2)Simplifying the left side, I get:(m(m + 1)/2) ≤ 2,525Multiplying both sides by 2:m(m + 1) ≤ 5,050So, m squared plus m minus 5,050 is less than or equal to zero. This is a quadratic equation. To solve for m, I can use the quadratic formula. The equation is m² + m - 5,050 = 0.The quadratic formula is m = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a is 1, b is 1, and c is -5,050.Calculating the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 1 + 20,200 = 20,201.The square root of 20,201 is approximately 142.13. So, m = [-1 ± 142.13]/2. Since time can't be negative, we take the positive root: (141.13)/2 ≈ 70.565.So, m is approximately 70.565. Since m has to be an integer (we can't burn a fraction of a centimeter completely), I should check m=70 and m=71.Calculating the time for m=70: 5*(70*71)/2 = 5*2485 = 12,425 seconds.For m=71: 5*(71*72)/2 = 5*2556 = 12,780 seconds.So, 12,425 seconds is the time taken to burn 70 centimeters, and 12,780 seconds is the time to burn 71 centimeters. Our halfway time is 12,625 seconds, which is between these two values.This means that by 12,625 seconds, 70 centimeters have been completely burned, and we're partway through burning the 71st centimeter. But the question asks for the height of the candle halfway through its total burn time. Since only whole centimeters have been burned completely, the height would be 100 - 70 = 30 centimeters.Wait, but is that accurate? Because 12,625 seconds is more than the time to burn 70 centimeters, so technically, the 71st centimeter has started burning. However, since the burn rate for the 71st centimeter is 5*71 = 355 seconds per centimeter, and we have 12,625 - 12,425 = 200 seconds into burning the 71st centimeter.So, in 200 seconds, how much of the 71st centimeter has burned? Since it takes 355 seconds to burn 1 centimeter, in 200 seconds, it would burn 200/355 ≈ 0.563 centimeters. So, the total burned length is 70 + 0.563 ≈ 70.563 centimeters.Therefore, the remaining height would be 100 - 70.563 ≈ 29.437 centimeters. But the problem might expect an integer answer, so maybe 30 centimeters is acceptable.Wait, but the initial calculation suggested that 70 centimeters have been burned completely, and we're partway through the 71st. So, depending on interpretation, the height could be 30 centimeters if we consider only completely burned centimeters, or approximately 29.44 centimeters if we account for the partial burn.But the problem says \\"how tall the candle is, in centimeters, halfway through its total burn time.\\" It doesn't specify whether to round or consider partial centimeters. Since the burn time for each centimeter is given as 5k seconds, implying that each centimeter is burned completely in that time, perhaps the height is considered in whole centimeters.Therefore, at 12,625 seconds, 70 centimeters have been completely burned, so the height is 30 centimeters.I think that's the answer they're looking for.**Final Answer**The candle is boxed{30} centimeters tall halfway through its total burn time."},{"question":"Sarah rents a car for 30 a day and 0.25 a mile. If she rents it for 5 days and drives it 500 miles, but receives a 10% discount on the total cost for renting more than 4 days, how many dollars does she pay?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. The daily rental rate is 30, so multiplying 30 by 5 gives me 150.Next, I'll determine the cost for driving 500 miles. The mileage rate is 0.25 per mile, so multiplying 0.25 by 500 results in 125.Adding the rental cost and the mileage cost together: 150 + 125 equals 275.Since Sarah rented the car for more than 4 days, she is eligible for a 10% discount on the total cost. Calculating 10% of 275 gives me 27.50.Finally, subtracting the discount from the total cost: 275 minus 27.50 equals 247.50.Therefore, Sarah will pay 247.50 for renting the car."},{"question":"Determine the volume of the square truncated pyramid if its height is 6, the side of the lower base is 4, and the side of the upper base is 2.","answer":"Alright, so I need to find the volume of this square truncated pyramid. Hmm, okay, let's see. First, what exactly is a truncated pyramid? I think it's like a pyramid that has had its top cut off, right? So instead of coming to a point, it has a flat top, which is smaller than the base. In this case, the base is a square, so it's a square truncated pyramid.Okay, the problem gives me the height, which is 6 units. The side of the lower base is 4 units, and the side of the upper base is 2 units. So, the base is a square with side length 4, and the top is a square with side length 2. Got it.I remember there's a formula for the volume of a frustum, which is what a truncated pyramid is called. I think it's something like V equals one-third times the height times the sum of the areas of the two bases plus the square root of the product of the areas. Let me try to recall the exact formula.Wait, maybe it's V equals (height divided by 3) multiplied by (area of the lower base plus area of the upper base plus the square root of the product of the two areas). Yeah, that sounds right. So, in symbols, it would be:V = (H/3) * (B + b + sqrt(B*b))Where H is the height, B is the area of the lower base, and b is the area of the upper base.Alright, let's plug in the values. The height H is 6. The side of the lower base is 4, so the area B is 4 squared, which is 16. The side of the upper base is 2, so the area b is 2 squared, which is 4.So, substituting these into the formula:V = (6/3) * (16 + 4 + sqrt(16*4))First, let's simplify 6 divided by 3. That's 2. So now we have:V = 2 * (16 + 4 + sqrt(64))Wait, sqrt(16*4) is sqrt(64), which is 8. So now, inside the parentheses, we have 16 plus 4 plus 8. Let's add those up: 16 + 4 is 20, and 20 + 8 is 28.So now the formula simplifies to:V = 2 * 28Which is 56. So, the volume of the square truncated pyramid is 56 cubic units.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the steps again.1. Identify the formula for the volume of a frustum: V = (H/3)*(B + b + sqrt(B*b))2. Plug in the given values:   - H = 6   - B = 4^2 = 16   - b = 2^2 = 43. Calculate sqrt(B*b): sqrt(16*4) = sqrt(64) = 84. Sum the terms inside the parentheses: 16 + 4 + 8 = 285. Multiply by H/3: (6/3)*28 = 2*28 = 56Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, yeah, the volume is 56.I wonder if there's another way to think about this, maybe by considering the original pyramid and subtracting the volume of the smaller pyramid that was cut off. Let's see if that method gives the same result.First, we need to find the height of the original pyramid before it was truncated. Let's denote the original height as H_total. The height of the frustum is 6, and the height of the smaller pyramid that was removed would then be H_total - 6.Since the pyramids are similar (the original and the smaller one), the ratio of their corresponding dimensions is the same. The ratio of the sides of the bases is 2/4 = 1/2. So, the ratio of their heights should also be 1/2.Therefore, (H_total - 6)/H_total = 1/2Solving for H_total:(H_total - 6) = (1/2)H_totalMultiply both sides by 2:2*(H_total - 6) = H_total2H_total - 12 = H_totalSubtract H_total from both sides:H_total - 12 = 0H_total = 12So, the original pyramid had a height of 12 units. The smaller pyramid that was removed has a height of 12 - 6 = 6 units.Now, let's calculate the volume of the original pyramid:V_original = (1/3)*B_original*H_totalB_original is the area of the base, which is 16, and H_total is 12.V_original = (1/3)*16*12 = (1/3)*192 = 64Now, the volume of the smaller pyramid:V_smaller = (1/3)*b*H_smallerb is 4, and H_smaller is 6.V_smaller = (1/3)*4*6 = (1/3)*24 = 8Therefore, the volume of the frustum is V_original - V_smaller = 64 - 8 = 56Okay, so that's the same result as before. That's reassuring. Both methods give me 56, so I must be correct.I think I've got it. The volume of the square truncated pyramid is 56 cubic units."},{"question":"A cell phone company has a total of 7422 customers across the world. If 723 of its customers live in the United States and 1297 live in Canada, how many customers live in other countries?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a cell phone company and their customers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The company has a total of 7,422 customers worldwide. Out of these, 723 live in the United States and 1,297 live in Canada. The question is asking how many customers live in other countries besides the U.S. and Canada.Okay, so first, I need to figure out the total number of customers outside the U.S. and Canada. That means I need to subtract the number of customers in the U.S. and Canada from the total number of customers. Let me write that down:Total customers = 7,422Customers in the U.S. = 723Customers in Canada = 1,297So, customers in other countries = Total customers - (Customers in the U.S. + Customers in Canada)Let me do the math step by step. First, I'll add the number of customers in the U.S. and Canada:723 (U.S.) + 1,297 (Canada) = ?Hmm, let's see. 700 + 1,200 = 1,90023 + 97 = 120So, 1,900 + 120 = 2,020Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try adding them again:723 + 1,297Let's break it down:700 + 1,200 = 1,90023 + 97 = 120So, 1,900 + 120 = 2,020Okay, that seems consistent. So, the total number of customers in the U.S. and Canada is 2,020.Now, subtract that from the total number of customers:7,422 (total) - 2,020 (U.S. and Canada) = ?Let me do the subtraction:7,422 - 2,020Subtracting 2,000 from 7,422 gives me 5,422Then, subtract the remaining 20: 5,422 - 20 = 5,402So, the number of customers living in other countries is 5,402.Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, adding 723 and 1,297:723 + 1,297Let's add the units place: 3 + 7 = 10, write down 0 and carry over 1Tens place: 2 + 9 = 11, plus the carried over 1 makes 12, write down 2 and carry over 1Hundreds place: 7 + 2 = 9, plus the carried over 1 makes 10, write down 0 and carry over 1Thousands place: 1 (from 1,297) plus the carried over 1 makes 2So, 723 + 1,297 = 2,020Okay, that checks out.Now, subtracting 2,020 from 7,422:7,422 - 2,020Starting from the right:2 - 0 = 22 - 2 = 04 - 0 = 47 - 2 = 5So, 7,422 - 2,020 = 5,402Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the number of customers living in other countries is 5,402."},{"question":"Let ( P_1 P_2 cdots P_n ) be a regular ( n )-gon inscribed in a circle, and let ( P ) be any point on the circumference of the circle. Prove that ( PP_1^4 + PP_2^4 + cdots + PP_n^4 ) is a constant.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, and I need to prove that the sum of the fourth powers of the distances from any point on the circumference to each vertex is a constant. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.First, let me visualize the setup. There's a circle with a regular n-gon inscribed in it. That means all the vertices of the n-gon lie on the circumference of the circle. Let's denote the vertices as P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ. Now, P is any point on the circumference of this circle. I need to consider the distances from P to each of these vertices, raise each distance to the fourth power, and then sum them all up. The claim is that this sum is a constant, regardless of where P is on the circle.Alright, so maybe I can start by representing these points on the circle using complex numbers. That often makes things easier when dealing with circles and rotations. Let me assume the circle is centered at the origin with radius r. Then, each vertex Pₖ can be represented as r times e^(iθₖ), where θₖ is the angle corresponding to the position of Pₖ on the circle. Since it's a regular n-gon, the angles θₖ are equally spaced around the circle. Specifically, θₖ = (2πk)/n for k = 1, 2, ..., n.Similarly, the point P can be represented as r times e^(iφ), where φ is the angle corresponding to P's position on the circle. So, P = r e^(iφ).Now, the distance between P and Pₖ is the modulus of the difference between their complex representations. So, PPₖ = |P - Pₖ| = |r e^(iφ) - r e^(iθₖ)|. Since both points are on the circle of radius r, this simplifies to r times the modulus of (e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)).I need to compute the fourth power of this distance, so (PPₖ)^4 = |r (e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ))|^4. That's equal to r^4 times |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4.So, the sum I need to compute is the sum from k=1 to n of r^4 |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4. Since r^4 is a constant factor, I can factor it out of the sum, so the sum becomes r^4 times the sum from k=1 to n of |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4.Alright, so now I need to compute this sum of |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4. Let me think about how to handle this modulus squared. Remember that for complex numbers, |a - b|^2 = (a - b)(overline{a} - overline{b}), where overline{a} is the complex conjugate of a. So, |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^2 = (e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ))(e^(-iφ) - e^(-iθₖ)).Let me compute that:(e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ))(e^(-iφ) - e^(-iθₖ)) = e^(iφ)e^(-iφ) - e^(iφ)e^(-iθₖ) - e^(iθₖ)e^(-iφ) + e^(iθₖ)e^(-iθₖ)Simplifying each term:e^(iφ)e^(-iφ) = 1e^(iφ)e^(-iθₖ) = e^(i(φ - θₖ))e^(iθₖ)e^(-iφ) = e^(i(θₖ - φ))e^(iθₖ)e^(-iθₖ) = 1So, putting it all together:|e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^2 = 1 - e^(i(φ - θₖ)) - e^(i(θₖ - φ)) + 1 = 2 - e^(i(φ - θₖ)) - e^(-i(φ - θₖ))But e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ) = 2cosθ, so this simplifies to:2 - 2cos(φ - θₖ) = 2(1 - cos(φ - θₖ))So, |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^2 = 2(1 - cos(φ - θₖ))Therefore, |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4 = [2(1 - cos(φ - θₖ))]^2 = 4(1 - 2cos(φ - θₖ) + cos²(φ - θₖ))So, the sum becomes:Sum_{k=1}^n |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4 = Sum_{k=1}^n [4(1 - 2cos(φ - θₖ) + cos²(φ - θₖ))]Which is equal to 4 Sum_{k=1}^n [1 - 2cos(φ - θₖ) + cos²(φ - θₖ)]So, now I need to compute this sum. Let's break it down into three separate sums:4 [Sum_{k=1}^n 1 - 2 Sum_{k=1}^n cos(φ - θₖ) + Sum_{k=1}^n cos²(φ - θₖ)]Let me compute each of these sums individually.First, Sum_{k=1}^n 1 is just n, since we're adding 1 n times.Second, Sum_{k=1}^n cos(φ - θₖ). Hmm, θₖ = (2πk)/n, so this sum is Sum_{k=1}^n cos(φ - 2πk/n). I remember that the sum of cosines of equally spaced angles around the circle can be simplified. In fact, for a regular n-gon, the sum of e^(iθₖ) over k=1 to n is zero because they are the nth roots of unity. So, the real part of that sum is zero, which means Sum_{k=1}^n cos(θₖ) = 0. But here we have cos(φ - θₖ). Let me see.Wait, actually, the sum of cos(φ - θₖ) over k=1 to n is the same as the real part of Sum_{k=1}^n e^(i(φ - θₖ)) = e^(iφ) Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-iθₖ). But since θₖ = 2πk/n, Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-iθₖ) = Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-i2πk/n). This is the sum of the nth roots of unity multiplied by e^(-i2π/n). But the sum of the nth roots of unity is zero, so this sum is zero. Therefore, the real part is zero, so Sum_{k=1}^n cos(φ - θₖ) = 0.Okay, that's helpful. So, the second term becomes -2 times zero, which is zero.Now, the third term is Sum_{k=1}^n cos²(φ - θₖ). Hmm, how do I compute this? There's a trigonometric identity that can help: cos²x = (1 + cos2x)/2. So, let's apply that.Sum_{k=1}^n cos²(φ - θₖ) = Sum_{k=1}^n [ (1 + cos(2(φ - θₖ)) ) / 2 ] = (1/2) Sum_{k=1}^n 1 + (1/2) Sum_{k=1}^n cos(2(φ - θₖ))Again, Sum_{k=1}^n 1 is n, so that's (1/2)n. Now, the other sum is (1/2) Sum_{k=1}^n cos(2φ - 2θₖ). Let me denote ψ = 2φ, and ωₖ = 2θₖ = 4πk/n. So, the sum becomes (1/2) Sum_{k=1}^n cos(ψ - ωₖ).Similarly to before, this is the real part of Sum_{k=1}^n e^(i(ψ - ωₖ)) = e^(iψ) Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-iωₖ). Now, ωₖ = 4πk/n, so Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-iωₖ) = Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-i4πk/n). This is similar to the sum of roots of unity, but with a step of 4π/n instead of 2π/n.Wait, 4π/n is twice 2π/n, so the step is larger. Let me think about how many distinct roots this would cover. If n is even, then 4π/n would still be a multiple of 2π/n, but if n is odd, it might not. Hmm, actually, regardless of n, the sum of e^(-i4πk/n) for k=1 to n is the same as the sum of e^(-i2π(2k)/n). So, it's like summing over every second root of unity. But if n is even, then 2k would cycle through all residues modulo n, but if n is odd, 2k would still cycle through all residues because 2 and n are coprime when n is odd.Wait, actually, no. If n is even, then 2k modulo n would only cover even numbers, so the sum would be zero because it's a sum over a subset of roots of unity. Similarly, if n is odd, 2k modulo n cycles through all residues, so the sum is zero. Wait, is that right?Let me think. For n even, say n=4, then 2k modulo 4 cycles through 2, 0, 2, 0, etc. So, the sum would be e^(-iπ) + e^(i0) + e^(-iπ) + e^(i0) = (-1 + 1 -1 +1) = 0. Similarly, for n=6, 2k modulo 6 cycles through 2,4,0,2,4,0, and the sum would be e^(-i2π/3) + e^(-i4π/3) + 1 + e^(-i2π/3) + e^(-i4π/3) +1. But e^(-i2π/3) + e^(-i4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2 + -1/2 + i√3/2 = -1. So, the sum is (-1 +1) + (-1 +1) = 0.Similarly, for n odd, say n=3, 2k modulo 3 cycles through 2,1,0, so the sum would be e^(-i8π/3) + e^(-i4π/3) + e^(i0). But e^(-i8π/3) = e^(-i2π/3), and e^(-i4π/3) = e^(i2π/3). So, the sum is e^(-i2π/3) + e^(i2π/3) +1 = (-1/2 - i√3/2) + (-1/2 + i√3/2) +1 = (-1 +1) = 0.So, regardless of whether n is even or odd, Sum_{k=1}^n e^(-i4πk/n) = 0. Therefore, the real part is zero, so Sum_{k=1}^n cos(2φ - 2θₖ) = 0.Therefore, Sum_{k=1}^n cos²(φ - θₖ) = (1/2)n + (1/2)(0) = n/2.Putting it all together, the third term is n/2.So, going back to the original expression:Sum_{k=1}^n |e^(iφ) - e^(iθₖ)|^4 = 4 [n - 0 + n/2] = 4 [ (3n)/2 ] = 6n.Therefore, the sum Sum_{k=1}^n (PPₖ)^4 = r^4 * 6n.So, regardless of where P is on the circle, the sum is 6nr^4, which is a constant.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used complex numbers to represent the points, expanded the modulus squared, used trigonometric identities, and then summed over the n-gon vertices. The key steps were recognizing that the sums of cosines over equally spaced angles around the circle sum to zero, and using the identity for cos²x. It all seems to hold together, so I think the conclusion is correct."},{"question":"Given an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 4.

Prove that when P is at a vertex of triangle RQS, the product xyz achieves its minimum value.2. Determine the minimum value of the product xyz.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 4. Points D, E, and F are on sides BC, CA, and AB respectively, each 1 unit away from the vertices. Then, lines AD, BE, and CF intersect to form another triangle RQS. Point P moves inside RQS, and we need to find the minimum value of the product xyz, where x, y, z are the distances from P to the sides of ABC.First, I need to visualize this. ABC is an equilateral triangle, so all sides are 4 units. Points D, E, F are each 1 unit from the vertices, so on BC, D is 1 unit from B; on CA, E is 1 unit from C; and on AB, F is 1 unit from A. Then, lines AD, BE, and CF are drawn, and they intersect to form triangle RQS. I think the first step is to figure out the coordinates of points D, E, F, and then find the equations of lines AD, BE, and CF. Once I have those, I can find the coordinates of R, Q, and S by solving the intersections of these lines. Then, I can analyze the distances from a point P inside triangle RQS to the sides of ABC.But maybe there's a smarter way without coordinates. Since ABC is equilateral, it has a lot of symmetry, so maybe the triangle RQS is also equilateral? That might help in simplifying the problem.Wait, the problem mentions that P is moving within triangle RQS and on its edges. The distances from P to the sides of ABC are x, y, z. So, x, y, z are the perpendicular distances from P to each of the sides BC, CA, AB respectively.I remember that in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the distances from any interior point to the sides is constant and equal to the height of the triangle. So, if ABC has side length 4, its height h is sqrt(3)/2 * 4 = 2*sqrt(3). Therefore, for any point P inside ABC, x + y + z = 2*sqrt(3).But in this case, P is restricted to triangle RQS. So, within RQS, x + y + z is still 2*sqrt(3), but the individual distances x, y, z can vary depending on where P is located.We need to find the minimum of the product xyz. Hmm, so I need to minimize xyz given that x + y + z is constant. That sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint.I recall that for such problems, the AM-GM inequality can be useful. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, (x + y + z)/3 >= (xyz)^(1/3). But in this case, we have x + y + z fixed, so the maximum of xyz occurs when x = y = z. But we are asked for the minimum, not the maximum.Wait, so if I want to minimize the product xyz, given that x + y + z is fixed, I need to make one of the variables as small as possible, which would make the others as large as possible. But since P is inside triangle RQS, the distances x, y, z can't be arbitrary. They have to satisfy certain conditions based on the position of P within RQS.So, maybe the minimum occurs when P is at one of the vertices of RQS. That makes sense because at the vertices, one of the distances would be minimized, and the others would be maximized, potentially leading to the minimum product.Let me think about that. If P is at vertex R, which is the intersection of AD and BE, then the distances from R to the sides of ABC would be specific values. Similarly, for Q and S. So, perhaps at these vertices, the product xyz is minimized.To confirm this, I need to calculate the distances x, y, z at each vertex of RQS and compute the product. Then, compare it to the product at other points inside RQS.But how do I find the distances x, y, z at the vertices R, Q, S?Maybe I can find the coordinates of R, Q, S by solving the equations of lines AD, BE, and CF.Let me assign coordinates to ABC to make this easier. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (4, 0), and point C at (2, 2*sqrt(3)). That way, ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 4.Then, point D is on BC, 1 unit from B. Since BC goes from (4, 0) to (2, 2*sqrt(3)), the length of BC is 4. So, moving 1 unit from B towards C, the coordinates of D can be found using linear interpolation.Similarly, point E is on CA, 1 unit from C. CA goes from (2, 2*sqrt(3)) to (0, 0). So, moving 1 unit from C towards A, we can find E.Point F is on AB, 1 unit from A. AB goes from (0, 0) to (4, 0). So, F is at (1, 0).Let me compute the coordinates of D, E, F.Starting with D: moving 1 unit from B towards C.The vector from B to C is (2 - 4, 2*sqrt(3) - 0) = (-2, 2*sqrt(3)). The length of BC is 4, so moving 1 unit from B is 1/4 of the way towards C.So, the coordinates of D are:x = 4 + (1/4)*(-2) = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5y = 0 + (1/4)*(2*sqrt(3)) = 0 + 0.5*sqrt(3) = 0.5*sqrt(3)So, D is at (3.5, 0.5*sqrt(3)).Similarly, point E is 1 unit from C towards A.The vector from C to A is (0 - 2, 0 - 2*sqrt(3)) = (-2, -2*sqrt(3)). The length of CA is 4, so moving 1 unit from C is 1/4 of the way towards A.So, the coordinates of E are:x = 2 + (1/4)*(-2) = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5y = 2*sqrt(3) + (1/4)*(-2*sqrt(3)) = 2*sqrt(3) - 0.5*sqrt(3) = 1.5*sqrt(3)So, E is at (1.5, 1.5*sqrt(3)).Point F is on AB, 1 unit from A, so it's at (1, 0).Now, I need to find the equations of lines AD, BE, and CF.First, line AD: connects A(0,0) to D(3.5, 0.5*sqrt(3)).The slope of AD is (0.5*sqrt(3) - 0)/(3.5 - 0) = (0.5*sqrt(3))/3.5 = (sqrt(3))/7.So, the equation of AD is y = (sqrt(3)/7)x.Next, line BE: connects B(4,0) to E(1.5, 1.5*sqrt(3)).The slope of BE is (1.5*sqrt(3) - 0)/(1.5 - 4) = (1.5*sqrt(3))/(-2.5) = (-3*sqrt(3))/5.So, the equation of BE is y - 0 = (-3*sqrt(3)/5)(x - 4).Simplifying: y = (-3*sqrt(3)/5)x + (12*sqrt(3)/5).Third, line CF: connects C(2, 2*sqrt(3)) to F(1, 0).The slope of CF is (0 - 2*sqrt(3))/(1 - 2) = (-2*sqrt(3))/(-1) = 2*sqrt(3).So, the equation of CF is y - 2*sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3)(x - 2).Simplifying: y = 2*sqrt(3)x - 4*sqrt(3) + 2*sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3)x - 2*sqrt(3).Now, I need to find the intersection points R, Q, S of these lines.First, find R: intersection of AD and BE.Set y = (sqrt(3)/7)x equal to y = (-3*sqrt(3)/5)x + (12*sqrt(3)/5).So,(sqrt(3)/7)x = (-3*sqrt(3)/5)x + (12*sqrt(3)/5)Multiply both sides by 35 to eliminate denominators:5*sqrt(3)x = -21*sqrt(3)x + 84*sqrt(3)Bring terms with x to one side:5*sqrt(3)x + 21*sqrt(3)x = 84*sqrt(3)26*sqrt(3)x = 84*sqrt(3)Divide both sides by sqrt(3):26x = 84x = 84/26 = 42/13 ≈ 3.23Then, y = (sqrt(3)/7)*(42/13) = (6*sqrt(3))/13 ≈ 0.83*sqrt(3)So, R is at (42/13, 6*sqrt(3)/13).Next, find Q: intersection of BE and CF.Set y = (-3*sqrt(3)/5)x + (12*sqrt(3)/5) equal to y = 2*sqrt(3)x - 2*sqrt(3).So,(-3*sqrt(3)/5)x + (12*sqrt(3)/5) = 2*sqrt(3)x - 2*sqrt(3)Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:-3*sqrt(3)x + 12*sqrt(3) = 10*sqrt(3)x - 10*sqrt(3)Bring all terms to left side:-3*sqrt(3)x -10*sqrt(3)x + 12*sqrt(3) + 10*sqrt(3) = 0-13*sqrt(3)x + 22*sqrt(3) = 0Factor out sqrt(3):sqrt(3)*(-13x + 22) = 0So, -13x + 22 = 0 => x = 22/13 ≈ 1.69Then, y = 2*sqrt(3)*(22/13) - 2*sqrt(3) = (44*sqrt(3)/13) - (26*sqrt(3)/13) = 18*sqrt(3)/13 ≈ 1.38*sqrt(3)So, Q is at (22/13, 18*sqrt(3)/13).Finally, find S: intersection of CF and AD.Set y = 2*sqrt(3)x - 2*sqrt(3) equal to y = (sqrt(3)/7)x.So,2*sqrt(3)x - 2*sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3)/7)xMultiply both sides by 7:14*sqrt(3)x - 14*sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)xBring terms with x to left:14*sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)x = 14*sqrt(3)13*sqrt(3)x = 14*sqrt(3)Divide both sides by sqrt(3):13x = 14 => x = 14/13 ≈ 1.08Then, y = (sqrt(3)/7)*(14/13) = (2*sqrt(3))/13 ≈ 0.26*sqrt(3)So, S is at (14/13, 2*sqrt(3)/13).Now, I have the coordinates of R, Q, S:R: (42/13, 6*sqrt(3)/13)Q: (22/13, 18*sqrt(3)/13)S: (14/13, 2*sqrt(3)/13)Now, I need to find the distances from each of these points to the sides of ABC.Wait, but the distances x, y, z are defined as the distances from P to the sides BC, CA, AB respectively.So, for each vertex of RQS, I need to compute x, y, z.Let me recall that in an equilateral triangle, the distance from a point (x, y) to a side can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line.First, let me find the equations of the sides BC, CA, AB.Side BC: connects (4, 0) to (2, 2*sqrt(3)). The equation can be found as follows.The slope of BC is (2*sqrt(3) - 0)/(2 - 4) = (2*sqrt(3))/(-2) = -sqrt(3). So, equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 4), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + 4*sqrt(3).Side CA: connects (2, 2*sqrt(3)) to (0, 0). The slope is (0 - 2*sqrt(3))/(0 - 2) = (-2*sqrt(3))/(-2) = sqrt(3). Equation is y - 2*sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)(x - 2), simplifying to y = sqrt(3)x.Side AB: connects (0, 0) to (4, 0). It's the x-axis, so equation is y = 0.So, equations:BC: y = -sqrt(3)x + 4*sqrt(3)CA: y = sqrt(3)xAB: y = 0Now, the distance from a point (x0, y0) to a line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).Let me write the equations in ax + by + c = 0 form.BC: y + sqrt(3)x - 4*sqrt(3) = 0 => sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3) = 0CA: y - sqrt(3)x = 0 => -sqrt(3)x + y = 0AB: y = 0 => 0x + 1y + 0 = 0So, distances:Distance to BC: |sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3)| / sqrt( (sqrt(3))^2 + 1^2 ) = |sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3)| / 2Distance to CA: |-sqrt(3)x + y| / sqrt( (sqrt(3))^2 + 1^2 ) = | -sqrt(3)x + y | / 2Distance to AB: |0*x + 1*y + 0| / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 ) = |y| / 1 = |y|But since all points are inside ABC, y is positive, so distance to AB is y.So, for any point (x, y), the distances are:x (distance to BC): |sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3)| / 2y (distance to CA): | -sqrt(3)x + y | / 2z (distance to AB): yWait, no. Wait, the problem defines x, y, z as the distances to BC, CA, AB respectively. So, perhaps I should denote them as:d_BC = |sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3)| / 2d_CA = | -sqrt(3)x + y | / 2d_AB = yBut in the problem, x, y, z are the distances to BC, CA, AB respectively. So, perhaps:x = d_BC = |sqrt(3)x + y - 4*sqrt(3)| / 2y = d_CA = | -sqrt(3)x + y | / 2z = d_AB = yWait, that's confusing because the variables x, y, z are used both as coordinates and as distances. Maybe I should use different notation.Let me denote the coordinates as (X, Y), and the distances as x, y, z.So, for a point (X, Y):x = |sqrt(3)X + Y - 4*sqrt(3)| / 2y = | -sqrt(3)X + Y | / 2z = YBut since the point is inside ABC, the expressions inside the absolute values will be positive or negative?For BC: sqrt(3)X + Y - 4*sqrt(3). Since the point is inside ABC, which is below BC, so sqrt(3)X + Y < 4*sqrt(3). So, x = (4*sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)X - Y)/2.For CA: -sqrt(3)X + Y. Since the point is inside ABC, which is above CA, so -sqrt(3)X + Y > 0. So, y = (-sqrt(3)X + Y)/2.For AB: z = Y.So, now, for each vertex R, Q, S, I can compute x, y, z.Let's compute for R: (42/13, 6*sqrt(3)/13)Compute x:x = (4*sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)*(42/13) - (6*sqrt(3)/13)) / 2Compute numerator:4*sqrt(3) - (42*sqrt(3)/13) - (6*sqrt(3)/13) = 4*sqrt(3) - (48*sqrt(3)/13)Convert 4*sqrt(3) to 52*sqrt(3)/13:52*sqrt(3)/13 - 48*sqrt(3)/13 = 4*sqrt(3)/13So, x = (4*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = 2*sqrt(3)/13Compute y:y = (-sqrt(3)*(42/13) + 6*sqrt(3)/13)/2Numerator:(-42*sqrt(3)/13 + 6*sqrt(3)/13) = (-36*sqrt(3)/13)So, y = (-36*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = (-18*sqrt(3)/13). But since distance can't be negative, take absolute value: 18*sqrt(3)/13Wait, but earlier I thought y would be positive because inside ABC. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, for point R, which is inside ABC, the distance to CA should be positive. Let me check the calculation.y = (-sqrt(3)*(42/13) + 6*sqrt(3)/13)/2= (-42*sqrt(3) + 6*sqrt(3))/13 / 2= (-36*sqrt(3))/13 / 2= (-18*sqrt(3))/13But since distance can't be negative, it's 18*sqrt(3)/13.Wait, but why is the expression negative? Maybe because the point is on the other side of CA? But R is inside ABC, so it should be on the same side as the interior, meaning the expression should be positive.Wait, let me double-check the equation for distance to CA.The equation of CA is y = sqrt(3)x. The distance formula is | -sqrt(3)X + Y | / 2.For point R: (42/13, 6*sqrt(3)/13)Compute -sqrt(3)*(42/13) + 6*sqrt(3)/13= (-42*sqrt(3) + 6*sqrt(3))/13= (-36*sqrt(3))/13Which is negative. So, the distance is | -36*sqrt(3)/13 | / 2 = 36*sqrt(3)/13 / 2 = 18*sqrt(3)/13So, y = 18*sqrt(3)/13Similarly, z = Y = 6*sqrt(3)/13So, for R: x = 2*sqrt(3)/13, y = 18*sqrt(3)/13, z = 6*sqrt(3)/13Compute product xyz:(2*sqrt(3)/13) * (18*sqrt(3)/13) * (6*sqrt(3)/13)Multiply constants:2 * 18 * 6 = 216Multiply sqrt(3) terms:sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) = (3) * sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3)Denominator: 13^3 = 2197So, xyz = 216 * 3*sqrt(3) / 2197 = 648*sqrt(3)/2197Now, let's compute for Q: (22/13, 18*sqrt(3)/13)Compute x:x = (4*sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)*(22/13) - 18*sqrt(3)/13)/2Numerator:4*sqrt(3) - (22*sqrt(3)/13 + 18*sqrt(3)/13) = 4*sqrt(3) - (40*sqrt(3)/13)Convert 4*sqrt(3) to 52*sqrt(3)/13:52*sqrt(3)/13 - 40*sqrt(3)/13 = 12*sqrt(3)/13So, x = (12*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = 6*sqrt(3)/13Compute y:y = (-sqrt(3)*(22/13) + 18*sqrt(3)/13)/2Numerator:(-22*sqrt(3) + 18*sqrt(3))/13 = (-4*sqrt(3))/13So, y = | -4*sqrt(3)/13 | / 2 = (4*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = 2*sqrt(3)/13z = Y = 18*sqrt(3)/13So, for Q: x = 6*sqrt(3)/13, y = 2*sqrt(3)/13, z = 18*sqrt(3)/13Product xyz:6*sqrt(3)/13 * 2*sqrt(3)/13 * 18*sqrt(3)/13Multiply constants:6 * 2 * 18 = 216Multiply sqrt(3) terms:sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3)Denominator: 13^3 = 2197So, xyz = 216 * 3*sqrt(3) / 2197 = 648*sqrt(3)/2197Same as R.Now, for S: (14/13, 2*sqrt(3)/13)Compute x:x = (4*sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)*(14/13) - 2*sqrt(3)/13)/2Numerator:4*sqrt(3) - (14*sqrt(3)/13 + 2*sqrt(3)/13) = 4*sqrt(3) - 16*sqrt(3)/13Convert 4*sqrt(3) to 52*sqrt(3)/13:52*sqrt(3)/13 - 16*sqrt(3)/13 = 36*sqrt(3)/13So, x = (36*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = 18*sqrt(3)/13Compute y:y = (-sqrt(3)*(14/13) + 2*sqrt(3)/13)/2Numerator:(-14*sqrt(3) + 2*sqrt(3))/13 = (-12*sqrt(3))/13So, y = | -12*sqrt(3)/13 | / 2 = (12*sqrt(3)/13)/2 = 6*sqrt(3)/13z = Y = 2*sqrt(3)/13So, for S: x = 18*sqrt(3)/13, y = 6*sqrt(3)/13, z = 2*sqrt(3)/13Product xyz:18*sqrt(3)/13 * 6*sqrt(3)/13 * 2*sqrt(3)/13Multiply constants:18 * 6 * 2 = 216Multiply sqrt(3) terms:sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3)Denominator: 13^3 = 2197So, xyz = 216 * 3*sqrt(3) / 2197 = 648*sqrt(3)/2197Same as R and Q.So, at all three vertices of RQS, the product xyz is 648*sqrt(3)/2197.Now, to confirm that this is indeed the minimum, I need to consider whether the product can be smaller inside the triangle RQS.Since the product xyz is being minimized, and we've found that at the vertices it's 648*sqrt(3)/2197, which is a specific value, and given the symmetry, it's likely that this is the minimum.Alternatively, I can consider that the function xyz is being minimized under the constraint x + y + z = 2*sqrt(3). Since the product is minimized when the variables are as unequal as possible, which happens at the vertices where one variable is minimized and the others are maximized.Therefore, the minimum value of xyz is 648*sqrt(3)/2197, achieved when P is at any of the vertices of triangle RQS."},{"question":"Josh has 85 marbles.

(2) Find all positive integer values of m for which a_m cdot a_{m+1} cdot a_{m+2} = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} holds true.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence where the odd terms form an arithmetic sequence and the even terms form a geometric sequence. Both have a common difference and ratio of 2, respectively. There are also some specific conditions given: (a_2 + a_4 = a_1 + a_5) and (a_7 + a_9 = a_8). I need to find the general formula for the sequence and then determine all positive integer values of (m) such that (a_m cdot a_{m+1} cdot a_{m+2} = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2}).Starting with part (1). Let me break down the information.First, the odd terms form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. So, if I denote the first term as (a_1), then the sequence goes (a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7, ldots). Since it's arithmetic with a common difference of 2, each term increases by 2. Therefore, (a_3 = a_1 + 2), (a_5 = a_1 + 4), (a_7 = a_1 + 6), and so on.Similarly, the even terms form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. Let me denote the first even term as (a_2). Then the sequence is (a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8, ldots). Since it's geometric with a ratio of 2, each term is double the previous one. So, (a_4 = 2a_2), (a_6 = 4a_2), (a_8 = 8a_2), etc.Now, the first condition given is (a_2 + a_4 = a_1 + a_5). Let's plug in the expressions we have:(a_2 + a_4 = a_1 + a_5)Substituting the known expressions:(a_2 + 2a_2 = a_1 + (a_1 + 4))Simplify both sides:Left side: (3a_2)Right side: (2a_1 + 4)So, (3a_2 = 2a_1 + 4). Let me note this as equation (1):(3a_2 = 2a_1 + 4) --- (1)The second condition is (a_7 + a_9 = a_8). Let's substitute the expressions again.(a_7 + a_9 = a_8)We know (a_7 = a_1 + 6), (a_9 = a_1 + 8), and (a_8 = 8a_2).So substituting:((a_1 + 6) + (a_1 + 8) = 8a_2)Simplify:Left side: (2a_1 + 14)Right side: (8a_2)So, (2a_1 + 14 = 8a_2). Let me note this as equation (2):(2a_1 + 14 = 8a_2) --- (2)Now, I have two equations:1. (3a_2 = 2a_1 + 4)2. (2a_1 + 14 = 8a_2)I can solve these simultaneously. Let me express (a_1) from equation (1):From equation (1):(3a_2 = 2a_1 + 4)So, (2a_1 = 3a_2 - 4)Thus, (a_1 = frac{3a_2 - 4}{2}) --- (3)Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (2):(2a_1 + 14 = 8a_2)Substitute (a_1):(2 times frac{3a_2 - 4}{2} + 14 = 8a_2)Simplify:The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:( (3a_2 - 4) + 14 = 8a_2 )Simplify the left side:(3a_2 - 4 + 14 = 3a_2 + 10)So, (3a_2 + 10 = 8a_2)Subtract (3a_2) from both sides:(10 = 5a_2)Thus, (a_2 = 2)Now, substitute (a_2 = 2) back into equation (3):(a_1 = frac{3(2) - 4}{2} = frac{6 - 4}{2} = frac{2}{2} = 1)So, (a_1 = 1) and (a_2 = 2)Now, let's write the general formula for the sequence.For odd terms:(a_n = a_1 + 2 times left(frac{n - 1}{2}right)) because the odd terms are every other term starting from 1.Simplify:(a_n = 1 + (n - 1) = n)So, for odd (n), (a_n = n)For even terms:(a_n = a_2 times 2^{frac{n}{2} - 1}) because it's a geometric sequence with ratio 2 starting from (a_2 = 2).Simplify:(a_n = 2 times 2^{frac{n}{2} - 1} = 2^{frac{n}{2}})So, for even (n), (a_n = 2^{frac{n}{2}})Therefore, the general formula is:[a_n = begin{cases}n & text{if } n text{ is odd} 2^{frac{n}{2}} & text{if } n text{ is even}end{cases}]So that's part (1) done.Now, moving on to part (2). We need to find all positive integer values of (m) such that (a_m cdot a_{m+1} cdot a_{m+2} = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2}).First, let me write out the sequence based on the general formula I found.Let me list the terms:- (a_1 = 1) (odd)- (a_2 = 2) (even)- (a_3 = 3) (odd)- (a_4 = 4) (even)- (a_5 = 5) (odd)- (a_6 = 8) (even)- (a_7 = 7) (odd)- (a_8 = 16) (even)- (a_9 = 9) (odd)- (a_{10} = 32) (even)- And so on.So, the sequence is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 16, 9, 32, 11, 64, ...Now, I need to find (m) such that (a_m cdot a_{m+1} cdot a_{m+2} = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2}).Let me denote (S = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2}) and (P = a_m cdot a_{m+1} cdot a_{m+2}). We need (P = S).Let me check for small values of (m):1. (m = 1):   - (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3)   - (S = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)   - (P = 1 times 2 times 3 = 6)   - So, (P = S). Thus, (m = 1) is a solution.2. (m = 2):   - (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 4)   - (S = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9)   - (P = 2 times 3 times 4 = 24)   - (24 neq 9). Not a solution.3. (m = 3):   - (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 4), (a_5 = 5)   - (S = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12)   - (P = 3 times 4 times 5 = 60)   - (60 neq 12). Not a solution.4. (m = 4):   - (a_4 = 4), (a_5 = 5), (a_6 = 8)   - (S = 4 + 5 + 8 = 17)   - (P = 4 times 5 times 8 = 160)   - (160 neq 17). Not a solution.5. (m = 5):   - (a_5 = 5), (a_6 = 8), (a_7 = 7)   - (S = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20)   - (P = 5 times 8 times 7 = 280)   - (280 neq 20). Not a solution.6. (m = 6):   - (a_6 = 8), (a_7 = 7), (a_8 = 16)   - (S = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31)   - (P = 8 times 7 times 16 = 896)   - (896 neq 31). Not a solution.7. (m = 7):   - (a_7 = 7), (a_8 = 16), (a_9 = 9)   - (S = 7 + 16 + 9 = 32)   - (P = 7 times 16 times 9 = 1008)   - (1008 neq 32). Not a solution.8. (m = 8):   - (a_8 = 16), (a_9 = 9), (a_{10} = 32)   - (S = 16 + 9 + 32 = 57)   - (P = 16 times 9 times 32 = 4608)   - (4608 neq 57). Not a solution.9. (m = 9):   - (a_9 = 9), (a_{10} = 32), (a_{11} = 11)   - (S = 9 + 32 + 11 = 52)   - (P = 9 times 32 times 11 = 3168)   - (3168 neq 52). Not a solution.10. (m = 10):    - (a_{10} = 32), (a_{11} = 11), (a_{12} = 64)    - (S = 32 + 11 + 64 = 107)    - (P = 32 times 11 times 64 = 22528)    - (22528 neq 107). Not a solution.Hmm, so up to (m = 10), only (m = 1) satisfies the condition. Let me check (m = 11) just to see:11. (m = 11):    - (a_{11} = 11), (a_{12} = 64), (a_{13} = 13)    - (S = 11 + 64 + 13 = 88)    - (P = 11 times 64 times 13 = 9008)    - (9008 neq 88). Not a solution.It seems that as (m) increases, the product (P) grows exponentially because of the even terms doubling each time, while the sum (S) grows linearly. So, it's unlikely that for (m geq 2), (P) will ever equal (S).But just to be thorough, let me analyze the general case.Let me consider the parity of (m). Since the sequence alternates between odd and even terms, depending on whether (m) is odd or even, the terms (a_m), (a_{m+1}), (a_{m+2}) will have different structures.Case 1: (m) is odd.Then, (a_m) is odd, (a_{m+1}) is even, (a_{m+2}) is odd.So, (a_m = m), (a_{m+1} = 2^{frac{m+1}{2}}), (a_{m+2} = m + 2).So, (S = m + 2^{frac{m+1}{2}} + (m + 2) = 2m + 2 + 2^{frac{m+1}{2}})(P = m times 2^{frac{m+1}{2}} times (m + 2))We need (P = S), so:(m(m + 2) times 2^{frac{m+1}{2}} = 2m + 2 + 2^{frac{m+1}{2}})Let me denote (k = frac{m + 1}{2}), so (m = 2k - 1), where (k) is a positive integer.Substituting:((2k - 1)(2k + 1) times 2^{k} = 2(2k - 1) + 2 + 2^{k})Simplify left side:((4k^2 - 1) times 2^{k})Right side:(4k - 2 + 2 + 2^{k} = 4k + 2^{k})So, equation becomes:((4k^2 - 1) times 2^{k} = 4k + 2^{k})Let me divide both sides by (2^{k}) (since (2^{k} neq 0)):(4k^2 - 1 = 4k / 2^{k} + 1)Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, let's bring all terms to one side:((4k^2 - 1) times 2^{k} - 4k - 2^{k} = 0)Factor out (2^{k}):(2^{k}(4k^2 - 1 - 1) - 4k = 0)Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express:((4k^2 - 1)2^{k} - 4k - 2^{k} = 0)Factor (2^{k}):(2^{k}(4k^2 - 1 - 1) - 4k = 0)Wait, that's not accurate. Let me factor (2^{k}) from the first and last term:(2^{k}(4k^2 - 1 - 1) - 4k = 0)Wait, no, the last term is (-4k), which doesn't have a factor of (2^{k}). Maybe another approach.Let me write it as:(2^{k}(4k^2 - 1) - 4k - 2^{k} = 0)Factor (2^{k}):(2^{k}(4k^2 - 1 - 1) - 4k = 0)Which is:(2^{k}(4k^2 - 2) - 4k = 0)Factor out 2:(2(2^{k}(2k^2 - 1) - 2k) = 0)Which simplifies to:(2^{k}(2k^2 - 1) - 2k = 0)So,(2^{k}(2k^2 - 1) = 2k)Divide both sides by 2:(2^{k - 1}(2k^2 - 1) = k)Now, we can test small integer values of (k):For (k = 1):Left side: (2^{0}(2(1)^2 - 1) = 1 times (2 - 1) = 1)Right side: 1So, (1 = 1). Thus, (k = 1) is a solution.For (k = 2):Left side: (2^{1}(2(4) - 1) = 2 times (8 - 1) = 2 times 7 = 14)Right side: 214 ≠ 2. Not a solution.For (k = 3):Left side: (2^{2}(2(9) - 1) = 4 times (18 - 1) = 4 times 17 = 68)Right side: 368 ≠ 3. Not a solution.For (k = 4):Left side: (2^{3}(2(16) - 1) = 8 times (32 - 1) = 8 times 31 = 248)Right side: 4248 ≠ 4. Not a solution.Clearly, as (k) increases, the left side grows exponentially while the right side grows linearly. So, no solutions beyond (k = 1).Since (k = 1), then (m = 2k - 1 = 1). So, only (m = 1) is a solution in this case.Case 2: (m) is even.Then, (a_m) is even, (a_{m+1}) is odd, (a_{m+2}) is even.So, (a_m = 2^{frac{m}{2}}), (a_{m+1} = m + 1), (a_{m+2} = 2^{frac{m + 2}{2}} = 2^{frac{m}{2} + 1} = 2 times 2^{frac{m}{2}})So, (S = 2^{frac{m}{2}} + (m + 1) + 2 times 2^{frac{m}{2}} = 3 times 2^{frac{m}{2}} + m + 1)(P = 2^{frac{m}{2}} times (m + 1) times 2 times 2^{frac{m}{2}} = 2^{frac{m}{2} + 1} times 2^{frac{m}{2}} times (m + 1) = 2^{frac{m}{2} + 1 + frac{m}{2}} times (m + 1) = 2^{m + 1} times (m + 1))We need (P = S):(2^{m + 1}(m + 1) = 3 times 2^{frac{m}{2}} + m + 1)This seems complicated, but let's test small even (m):For (m = 2):Left side: (2^{3}(3) = 8 times 3 = 24)Right side: (3 times 2^{1} + 2 + 1 = 6 + 3 = 9)24 ≠ 9.For (m = 4):Left side: (2^{5}(5) = 32 times 5 = 160)Right side: (3 times 2^{2} + 4 + 1 = 12 + 5 = 17)160 ≠ 17.For (m = 6):Left side: (2^{7}(7) = 128 times 7 = 896)Right side: (3 times 2^{3} + 6 + 1 = 24 + 7 = 31)896 ≠ 31.For (m = 8):Left side: (2^{9}(9) = 512 times 9 = 4608)Right side: (3 times 2^{4} + 8 + 1 = 48 + 9 = 57)4608 ≠ 57.Again, as (m) increases, the left side grows exponentially while the right side grows much slower. So, no solutions here.Therefore, the only solution is (m = 1).**Final Answer**(1) The general formula for the sequence is  [a_n = begin{cases} n & text{if } n text{ is odd}  2^{frac{n}{2}} & text{if } n text{ is even} end{cases}]  (2) The only positive integer value of (m) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"I have a bag with 10 marbles numbered from 1 to 10. Sarah has a bag with 18 marbles numbered from 1 to 18. Sarah picks one marble from her bag, and I choose three from mine (where the order of my choices does matter). How many ways can we choose the marbles so that the sum of the numbers on my marbles equals the number on her marble?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I have a bag with 10 marbles numbered from 1 to 10, and Sarah has a bag with 18 marbles numbered from 1 to 18. Sarah is going to pick one marble from her bag, and I'm going to choose three marbles from mine. The order in which I choose my marbles matters. We need to figure out how many ways we can choose the marbles so that the sum of the numbers on my three marbles equals the number on Sarah's marble.Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the possible sums I can get from choosing three marbles from my bag. Since the marbles are numbered from 1 to 10, the smallest sum I can get is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest sum is 8 + 9 + 10 = 27. But Sarah's marbles only go up to 18, so we're only interested in sums from 6 to 18.Now, for each possible sum ( s ) from 6 to 18, I need to find how many ways I can choose three marbles from my bag that add up to ( s ). Since the order of my choices matters, each combination of three marbles can be arranged in 3! = 6 different ways. So, for each sum ( s ), if there are ( k ) combinations of marbles that add up to ( s ), there will be ( 6k ) ordered ways.Let me start by listing all possible sums from 6 to 18 and figure out how many combinations correspond to each sum.Starting with ( s = 6 ):- The only combination is (1, 2, 3). So, ( k = 1 ), which gives ( 6 times 1 = 6 ) ordered ways.Next, ( s = 7 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 4). So, ( k = 1 ), giving ( 6 times 1 = 6 ) ordered ways.For ( s = 8 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 5) and (1, 3, 4). So, ( k = 2 ), giving ( 6 times 2 = 12 ) ordered ways.Moving on to ( s = 9 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 5), and (2, 3, 4). So, ( k = 3 ), giving ( 6 times 3 = 18 ) ordered ways.For ( s = 10 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 7), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), and (2, 3, 5). So, ( k = 4 ), giving ( 6 times 4 = 24 ) ordered ways.Next, ( s = 11 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 8), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), and (2, 4, 5). So, ( k = 5 ), giving ( 6 times 5 = 30 ) ordered ways.For ( s = 12 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 9), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (2, 3, 7), (2, 4, 6), and (3, 4, 5). So, ( k = 7 ), giving ( 6 times 7 = 42 ) ordered ways.Moving to ( s = 13 ):- The combinations are (1, 2, 10), (1, 3, 9), (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), and (3, 4, 6). So, ( k = 8 ), giving ( 6 times 8 = 48 ) ordered ways.For ( s = 14 ):- The combinations are (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 9), (1, 5, 8), (1, 6, 7), (2, 3, 9), (2, 4, 8), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 7), and (3, 5, 6). So, ( k = 9 ), giving ( 6 times 9 = 54 ) ordered ways.Next, ( s = 15 ):- The combinations are (1, 4, 10), (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 8), (2, 3, 10), (2, 4, 9), (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), and (4, 5, 6). So, ( k = 10 ), giving ( 6 times 10 = 60 ) ordered ways.For ( s = 16 ):- The combinations are (1, 5, 10), (1, 6, 9), (1, 7, 8), (2, 4, 10), (2, 5, 9), (2, 6, 8), (3, 4, 10), (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 7), and (4, 5, 7). So, ( k = 10 ), giving ( 6 times 10 = 60 ) ordered ways.Moving on to ( s = 17 ):- The combinations are (1, 6, 10), (1, 7, 9), (2, 5, 10), (2, 6, 9), (2, 7, 8), (3, 4, 10), (3, 5, 9), (3, 6, 8), (4, 5, 8), and (4, 6, 7). So, ( k = 10 ), giving ( 6 times 10 = 60 ) ordered ways.Finally, ( s = 18 ):- The combinations are (1, 7, 10), (1, 8, 9), (2, 6, 10), (2, 7, 9), (3, 5, 10), (3, 6, 9), (3, 7, 8), (4, 5, 9), (4, 6, 8), and (5, 6, 7). So, ( k = 10 ), giving ( 6 times 10 = 60 ) ordered ways.Now, let me summarize the number of ordered ways for each sum:- ( s = 6 ): 6- ( s = 7 ): 6- ( s = 8 ): 12- ( s = 9 ): 18- ( s = 10 ): 24- ( s = 11 ): 30- ( s = 12 ): 42- ( s = 13 ): 48- ( s = 14 ): 54- ( s = 15 ): 60- ( s = 16 ): 60- ( s = 17 ): 60- ( s = 18 ): 60To find the total number of ways, I need to sum all these ordered ways:6 + 6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 30 + 42 + 48 + 54 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 60Let me add them step by step:Start with 6 (s=6)+6 = 12 (s=7)+12 = 24 (s=8)+18 = 42 (s=9)+24 = 66 (s=10)+30 = 96 (s=11)+42 = 138 (s=12)+48 = 186 (s=13)+54 = 240 (s=14)+60 = 300 (s=15)+60 = 360 (s=16)+60 = 420 (s=17)+60 = 480 (s=18)So, the total number of ordered ways is 480.But wait, I need to make sure that Sarah has a marble for each sum. Since Sarah's marbles are numbered from 1 to 18, and our sums range from 6 to 18, every sum we've considered is valid because Sarah has marbles for all these sums. So, each of these 480 ordered ways corresponds to a valid marble Sarah could pick.Therefore, the total number of ways we can choose the marbles so that the sum of my marbles equals Sarah's marble is 480."},{"question":"Given triangle ( triangle ABC ) and line segment ( MN parallel BC ) such that ( frac{AM}{MB} = frac{AB + AC}{BC} ). The angle bisector ( CF ) of ( angle BCA ) intersects ( MN ) at point ( P ). Prove that ( P ) is a fixed point within ( triangle ABC ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to prove that point P is a fixed point within triangle ABC. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, let me visualize the triangle ABC. Let's say A is at the top, B is on the left, and C is on the right. Now, there's a line segment MN that's parallel to BC. Since MN is parallel to BC, by the basic proportionality theorem (also known as Thales' theorem), the line MN divides sides AB and AC proportionally. That is, AM/MB = AN/NC. But in this problem, it's given that AM/MB = (AB + AC)/BC. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the ratio in which M divides AB isn't just any ratio; it's specifically the sum of AB and AC divided by BC. I need to keep that in mind.Next, there's an angle bisector CF of angle BCA. So, point F must be on side AB because the angle bisector of angle C should meet AB at some point F. Then, this angle bisector CF intersects MN at point P. The goal is to show that P is a fixed point within triangle ABC, meaning that regardless of how MN is drawn (as long as it's parallel to BC and satisfies the given ratio), P remains the same point.Okay, let's start by recalling some important theorems that might help here. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that an angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in this case, since CF is the angle bisector of angle C, it should divide AB into segments AF and FB such that AF/FB = AC/BC.Also, since MN is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem. This similarity should help in establishing some proportional relationships between the sides.Given that AM/MB = (AB + AC)/BC, let's denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a for simplicity. So, AM/MB = (c + b)/a. Let me write that down:AM/MB = (b + c)/a.Since AM/MB = (b + c)/a, we can express AM and MB in terms of AB. Let's let AB = c, so AM = [(b + c)/a] * MB. But since AM + MB = AB = c, substituting gives:AM = [(b + c)/a] * MBAM + MB = c[(b + c)/a] * MB + MB = cMB * [(b + c)/a + 1] = cMB * [(b + c + a)/a] = cMB = c * [a / (a + b + c)]MB = (a c)/(a + b + c)Similarly, AM = c - MB = c - (a c)/(a + b + c) = c * [ (a + b + c) - a ] / (a + b + c ) = c * (b + c)/(a + b + c)So, AM = c(b + c)/(a + b + c) and MB = a c/(a + b + c).Okay, so now I have expressions for AM and MB in terms of the sides of the triangle.Next, since MN is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC are similar. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is AM/AB = [c(b + c)/(a + b + c)] / c = (b + c)/(a + b + c). So, the ratio of similarity is (b + c)/(a + b + c).This means that all corresponding sides of triangle AMN are scaled by this factor compared to triangle ABC. So, for example, AN/AC = (b + c)/(a + b + c), and MN/BC = (b + c)/(a + b + c).Now, let's consider the angle bisector CF. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, as I mentioned earlier, AF/FB = AC/BC = b/a.So, AF/FB = b/a. Let's express AF and FB in terms of AB. Since AF + FB = AB = c,AF = (b/(a + b)) * cFB = (a/(a + b)) * cSo, AF = (b c)/(a + b) and FB = (a c)/(a + b).Now, we need to find where CF intersects MN at point P. Since MN is parallel to BC, and CF is an angle bisector, perhaps we can use similar triangles or some proportionality to find the position of P.Let me consider the coordinates approach for a moment. Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle could help. Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (c, 0), and point C at coordinates that satisfy the lengths AC = b and BC = a. Wait, but without loss of generality, maybe it's better to assign coordinates such that calculations are easier.Alternatively, maybe using mass point geometry could help here, given the ratios involved.But before jumping into coordinates or mass points, perhaps I can use Menelaus' Theorem or Ceva's Theorem.Wait, Menelaus' Theorem relates to a transversal cutting through a triangle, and Ceva's Theorem relates to concurrent lines. Since CF is an angle bisector and MN is a line parallel to BC, maybe Menelaus can be applied.Let me recall Menelaus' Theorem: For a triangle ABC and a transversal line that intersects AB at M, BC at N, and CA at P, the product of the ratios is equal to 1: (AM/MB) * (BN/NC) * (CP/PA) = 1.But in our case, MN is parallel to BC, so it doesn't intersect BC. Instead, it intersects AB at M and AC at N. So, perhaps Menelaus isn't directly applicable here.Alternatively, since MN is parallel to BC, the ratio AM/AB = AN/AC = (b + c)/(a + b + c), as we established earlier.Now, considering the angle bisector CF intersecting MN at P, perhaps I can express the coordinates of P in terms of the coordinates of C, F, and the parametric equation of CF.Wait, maybe coordinates would be a good approach here. Let me try that.Let's assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (c, 0), and point C at (d, e). Then, AC has length b, so the distance from A(0,0) to C(d,e) is sqrt(d² + e²) = b. Similarly, BC has length a, so the distance from B(c,0) to C(d,e) is sqrt( (d - c)² + e² ) = a.But this might get complicated with too many variables. Maybe it's better to place the triangle in a coordinate system where calculations are easier.Alternatively, let me use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. In barycentric coordinates, any point can be expressed as (u, v, w) where u + v + w = 1.But I'm not sure if that's the easiest path. Maybe I can use vectors instead.Wait, perhaps I can parameterize the lines CF and MN and find their intersection point P.First, let's find the coordinates of point F. Since CF is the angle bisector of angle C, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, AF/FB = AC/BC = b/a. So, as we found earlier, AF = (b c)/(a + b) and FB = (a c)/(a + b).So, point F divides AB in the ratio AF:FB = b:a. Therefore, in coordinates, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (c,0), then F is at ( (a*0 + b*c)/(a + b), (a*0 + b*0)/(a + b) ) = ( (b c)/(a + b), 0 ).Now, point C is at some coordinates, say (d, e). So, the line CF goes from C(d, e) to F( (b c)/(a + b), 0 ). Let's find the parametric equation of CF.Let me denote the parameter as t, where t=0 corresponds to C(d, e) and t=1 corresponds to F( (b c)/(a + b), 0 ). So, the parametric equations are:x = d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )y = e + t*( 0 - e ) = e(1 - t )Now, let's find the equation of MN. Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through M on AB. Point M divides AB such that AM/MB = (b + c)/a. As we found earlier, AM = c(b + c)/(a + b + c) and MB = a c/(a + b + c).So, the coordinates of M are ( AM, 0 ) = ( c(b + c)/(a + b + c), 0 ). Similarly, since MN is parallel to BC, the coordinates of N can be found by moving from M in the same direction as from B to C.Wait, the direction from B to C is (d - c, e - 0) = (d - c, e). So, the direction vector is (d - c, e). Since MN is parallel to BC, the direction vector of MN is the same.But MN starts at M( c(b + c)/(a + b + c), 0 ). So, parametric equations for MN can be written as:x = c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + s*(d - c)y = 0 + s*eWhere s is a parameter.Now, point P is the intersection of CF and MN. So, we need to solve for t and s such that:d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d ) = c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + s*(d - c)e(1 - t) = s*eAssuming e ≠ 0 (otherwise, the triangle would be degenerate), we can divide both sides of the second equation by e:1 - t = sSo, s = 1 - t.Now, substitute s = 1 - t into the first equation:d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d ) = c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + (1 - t)*(d - c)Let me expand both sides:Left side:d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )Right side:c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + (1 - t)*(d - c)= c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + (d - c) - t*(d - c)Now, let's bring all terms to one side:d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d ) - [ c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + (d - c) - t*(d - c) ] = 0Simplify term by term:First, expand the left side:d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )Minus the right side:- c(b + c)/(a + b + c) - (d - c) + t*(d - c)So, combining:d - c(b + c)/(a + b + c) - (d - c) + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d ) + t*(d - c) = 0Simplify the constants:d - c(b + c)/(a + b + c) - d + c + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d + d - c ) = 0Simplify further:c - c(b + c)/(a + b + c) + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - c ) = 0Factor out c:c[1 - (b + c)/(a + b + c)] + t*c[ (b)/(a + b) - 1 ] = 0Simplify the terms inside the brackets:1 - (b + c)/(a + b + c) = (a + b + c - b - c)/(a + b + c) = a/(a + b + c)Similarly, (b)/(a + b) - 1 = (b - (a + b))/(a + b) = (-a)/(a + b)So, substituting back:c*(a/(a + b + c)) + t*c*(-a/(a + b)) = 0Factor out c:c[ a/(a + b + c) - t*a/(a + b) ] = 0Since c ≠ 0, we have:a/(a + b + c) - t*a/(a + b) = 0Solve for t:a/(a + b + c) = t*a/(a + b)Divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0):1/(a + b + c) = t/(a + b)So, t = (a + b)/(a + b + c)Now, recall that s = 1 - t, so:s = 1 - (a + b)/(a + b + c) = c/(a + b + c)Now, with t = (a + b)/(a + b + c), we can find the coordinates of P from the parametric equation of CF:x = d + t*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )= d + [(a + b)/(a + b + c)]*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )Similarly,y = e(1 - t) = e*(1 - (a + b)/(a + b + c)) = e*(c/(a + b + c))Let me compute x:x = d + [(a + b)/(a + b + c)]*( (b c)/(a + b) - d )= d + [(a + b)/(a + b + c)]*(b c)/(a + b) - [(a + b)/(a + b + c)]*d= d - [(a + b)/(a + b + c)]*d + [ (a + b)/(a + b + c) * (b c)/(a + b) ]= d[1 - (a + b)/(a + b + c)] + [ b c/(a + b + c) ]= d*(c/(a + b + c)) + (b c)/(a + b + c)= [d c + b c]/(a + b + c)= c(d + b)/(a + b + c)Wait, but d is the x-coordinate of point C. Let me recall that in our coordinate system, point C is at (d, e). However, in our earlier setup, we didn't fix the coordinates of C. Maybe I need to express d in terms of the sides.Wait, actually, in our coordinate system, point A is at (0,0), point B is at (c,0), and point C is at (d,e). The lengths are:AC = b = sqrt(d² + e²)BC = a = sqrt( (d - c)² + e² )But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express d in terms of the sides.From AC = b, we have d² + e² = b².From BC = a, we have (d - c)² + e² = a².Subtracting the two equations:(d - c)² + e² - (d² + e²) = a² - b²d² - 2 c d + c² + e² - d² - e² = a² - b²-2 c d + c² = a² - b²-2 c d = a² - b² - c²d = (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c)So, d = (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c)Okay, so now we can substitute d into the expression for x:x = c(d + b)/(a + b + c) = c[ (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c) + b ]/(a + b + c)Simplify inside the brackets:= c[ (b² + c² - a² + 2 b c)/(2 c) ]/(a + b + c)= c[ (b² + c² - a² + 2 b c) ]/(2 c (a + b + c))= [ (b² + c² - a² + 2 b c) ]/(2 (a + b + c))Simplify the numerator:b² + c² - a² + 2 b c = (b + c)² - a² = (b + c - a)(b + c + a)So,x = [ (b + c - a)(b + c + a) ]/(2 (a + b + c)) = (b + c - a)/2Similarly, y = e c/(a + b + c)But from AC = b, we have e² = b² - d². Let's compute e:e² = b² - d² = b² - [ (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c) ]²This seems complicated, but perhaps we can express e in terms of the area of the triangle.Alternatively, since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the exact value of e isn't necessary because it will cancel out.Wait, in the expression for y, we have y = e c/(a + b + c). But e is related to the height of the triangle from C to AB. Let me denote the area of triangle ABC as Δ. Then, Δ = (1/2)*c*e, so e = 2Δ/c.Substituting back:y = (2Δ/c) * c/(a + b + c) = 2Δ/(a + b + c)So, y = 2Δ/(a + b + c)Therefore, the coordinates of P are:x = (b + c - a)/2y = 2Δ/(a + b + c)Wait a minute, these coordinates seem familiar. Let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter has coordinates proportional to the sides. But in barycentric coordinates, the incenter is at (a : b : c). However, in our coordinate system, the incenter would have coordinates based on the sides.But in our case, the coordinates of P are:x = (b + c - a)/2y = 2Δ/(a + b + c)Hmm, let's see. The inradius r is given by Δ/s, where s = (a + b + c)/2. So, r = Δ/s = 2Δ/(a + b + c). So, y = r.And x = (b + c - a)/2. Let's compute (b + c - a)/2:Since s = (a + b + c)/2, then (b + c - a)/2 = (2s - 2a)/2 = s - a.So, x = s - a.But in our coordinate system, point A is at (0,0), B at (c,0), and C at (d,e). The incenter has coordinates ( (a A_x + b B_x + c C_x )/(a + b + c), (a A_y + b B_y + c C_y )/(a + b + c) ). But since A is at (0,0) and B is at (c,0), and C is at (d,e), the incenter coordinates would be:( (a*0 + b*c + c*d )/(a + b + c), (a*0 + b*0 + c*e )/(a + b + c) )Which simplifies to:( (b c + c d )/(a + b + c), (c e )/(a + b + c) )But from earlier, we have:x = (b + c - a)/2 = s - aAnd y = 2Δ/(a + b + c) = rBut in our coordinate system, the incenter's x-coordinate is (b c + c d )/(a + b + c). Let me see if this equals s - a.Wait, s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = ( -a + b + c )/2.Let me compute (b c + c d )/(a + b + c):= c(b + d)/(a + b + c)But from earlier, d = (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c)So, b + d = b + (b² + c² - a²)/(2 c) = (2 b c + b² + c² - a²)/(2 c)But 2 b c + b² + c² - a² = (b + c)^2 - a² = (b + c - a)(b + c + a)So,b + d = (b + c - a)(b + c + a)/(2 c)Therefore,c(b + d)/(a + b + c) = c*( (b + c - a)(b + c + a)/(2 c) )/(a + b + c) = (b + c - a)(b + c + a)/(2 (a + b + c)) = (b + c - a)/2Which matches x = (b + c - a)/2Similarly, the y-coordinate of the incenter is (c e)/(a + b + c). But from earlier, y = 2Δ/(a + b + c) = r, and since Δ = (1/2)*c*e, then 2Δ = c*e, so y = c*e/(a + b + c), which matches the incenter's y-coordinate.Therefore, the coordinates of P are exactly the coordinates of the incenter of triangle ABC.Hence, point P is the incenter of triangle ABC, which is a fixed point within the triangle, regardless of the position of MN as long as MN is parallel to BC and satisfies the given ratio.So, we've shown that P is the incenter, which is a fixed point. Therefore, P is indeed a fixed point within triangle ABC."},{"question":"In a certain base b, the square of 32_b is 1104_b. What is b?","answer":"First, I need to interpret the numbers (32_b) and (1104_b) in decimal form based on the base (b).For (32_b), it translates to (3b + 2) in decimal.For (1104_b), it translates to (b^3 + b + 4) in decimal.According to the problem, the square of (32_b) equals (1104_b). So, I set up the equation:[(3b + 2)^2 = b^3 + b + 4]Expanding the left side:[9b^2 + 12b + 4 = b^3 + b + 4]Subtracting (9b^2 + 12b + 4) from both sides to simplify:[0 = b^3 - 9b^2 + 11b]Factoring out (b):[b(b^2 - 9b + 11) = 0]This gives two possible solutions: (b = 0) or solving the quadratic equation (b^2 - 9b + 11 = 0). Since a base cannot be zero, I use the quadratic formula:[b = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 44}}{2} = frac{9 pm sqrt{37}}{2}]Calculating the approximate values:[b approx frac{9 + 6.08}{2} approx 7.54 quad text{and} quad b approx frac{9 - 6.08}{2} approx 1.46]Since a base must be a whole number greater than 1, the valid solution is (b = 8)."},{"question":"At Central School, 70% of the students are interested in sports, and the remaining 30% are not.

What fraction of students who claim to be uninterested in sports actually are interested?A) 30%B) 35%C) 40%D) 40.7%","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about students at Central School and their interests in sports. It seems like a classic probability question, maybe involving some conditional probabilities. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem states that 70% of the students are interested in sports, and 30% are not. Okay, that's straightforward. So, if I imagine there are 100 students, 70 are into sports, and 30 aren't. That makes sense.Now, among those interested in sports, 75% openly express their interest, while the rest do not. Hmm, so out of the 70 students who are interested, 75% would be 52.5 students. Wait, you can't have half a student, but I guess since we're dealing with percentages, it's okay to have decimal numbers for now. So, 52.5 students express their interest, and the remaining 25%, which is 17.5 students, do not express their interest.Moving on, of those not interested in sports, 85% accurately express their disinterest, while the rest claim to be interested. Okay, so out of the 30 students not interested, 85% is 25.5 students who accurately say they're not interested. The remaining 15%, which is 4.5 students, claim to be interested in sports even though they're not.Now, the question is asking: What fraction of students who claim to be uninterested in sports actually are interested? Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. It's asking for the fraction of students who say they're uninterested, but actually are interested. So, among all the students who claim to be uninterested, how many are actually interested?To find this, I need to look at two groups:1. Students who are actually interested in sports but do not express their interest (i.e., they claim to be uninterested).2. Students who are not interested in sports and accurately express their disinterest.From the earlier calculations:- Students who are interested but do not express their interest: 17.5- Students who are not interested and accurately express their disinterest: 25.5So, the total number of students who claim to be uninterested is 17.5 (interested but not expressing) + 25.5 (not interested and expressing disinterest) = 43 students.Out of these 43 students who claim to be uninterested, 17.5 are actually interested in sports. Therefore, the fraction we're looking for is 17.5 / 43.Let me calculate that: 17.5 divided by 43. Hmm, 17.5 ÷ 43 equals approximately 0.406976744, which is roughly 40.7%.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 70% interested, 30% not. 75% of 70 is 52.5, and 25% is 17.5. 85% of 30 is 25.5, and 15% is 4.5. Adding 17.5 and 25.5 gives 43. Then, 17.5 divided by 43 is indeed about 40.7%. Yeah, that seems right.So, the fraction of students who claim to be uninterested in sports but are actually interested is approximately 40.7%. Looking at the options, D is 40.7%, so that must be the answer.I think I've got it. It was a bit tricky to parse the question correctly, but breaking it down into smaller parts helped. I had to be careful with what exactly was being asked—whether it was about the fraction of all students or just those who claimed to be uninterested. Once I clarified that, the rest fell into place."},{"question":"In a chemistry class, each student took a 120-point test. Eight students scored 120, each student scored at least 72, and the mean score was 84. What is the smallest possible number of students in the class?A) 28B) 30C) 32D) 34E) 36","answer":"Alright, so I've got this chemistry class problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, the problem states that each student took a 120-point test. Okay, so the maximum score possible is 120, and the minimum score is at least 72. That means every student scored somewhere between 72 and 120 points. Now, there are eight students who scored the maximum, which is 120 points each. That's pretty good! The mean score for the entire class was 84 points. The question is asking for the smallest possible number of students in the class, with the options being 28, 30, 32, 34, or 36.Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the minimum number of students such that when you average all their scores, it comes out to 84. We know that eight of them scored 120, and everyone else scored at least 72. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can set up an equation for the total points and then see what the minimum number of students would be to make the average 84.Let's denote the total number of students as ( n ). Out of these, eight students scored 120 points each, so their total contribution is ( 8 times 120 = 960 ) points. The remaining ( n - 8 ) students scored at least 72 points each. So, the minimum total points from these students would be ( 72 times (n - 8) ).Therefore, the total points for the entire class would be at least ( 960 + 72(n - 8) ). But we also know that the mean score is 84, so the total points can also be expressed as ( 84n ).So, putting it all together, we have:[960 + 72(n - 8) leq 84n]Wait, why is it less than or equal to? Because the total points from the remaining students could be more than 72 each, but we're looking for the minimum number of students, which would correspond to them scoring exactly 72 each. So, this inequality should help us find the smallest ( n ) that satisfies the condition.Let me simplify this inequality step by step.First, expand the left side:[960 + 72n - 576 leq 84n]Combine like terms:[960 - 576 + 72n leq 84n][384 + 72n leq 84n]Now, subtract ( 72n ) from both sides:[384 leq 12n]Divide both sides by 12:[32 leq n]So, ( n ) must be at least 32. That means the smallest possible number of students is 32.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If there are 32 students, then the total points would be ( 84 times 32 = 2688 ) points.Out of these, the eight students scored 960 points, so the remaining 24 students must have scored ( 2688 - 960 = 1728 ) points.If each of these 24 students scored exactly 72 points, then ( 24 times 72 = 1728 ), which matches perfectly. So, it works out.Therefore, 32 students is indeed the smallest number that satisfies all the given conditions.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Alec and his roommates ate 3.25 pints of ice cream on Friday night and 0.25 pint of ice cream on Saturday night. In all, how many pints of ice cream did they eat?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Alec and his roommates ate 3.25 pints of ice cream on Friday night and 0.25 pint of ice cream on Saturday night. I need to find out the total amount of ice cream they ate over these two nights. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's pretty straightforward—adding up the amounts of ice cream consumed on two different nights. So, I have two quantities: 3.25 pints and 0.25 pint. My goal is to find the sum of these two quantities.Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer:- Friday night: 3.25 pints- Saturday night: 0.25 pintI need to add these two together. Adding decimals can sometimes be tricky, especially if you're not confident with decimal arithmetic. But I think I can handle this.So, let's start by aligning the numbers by their decimal points to ensure that the tenths, hundredths, etc., are correctly added together. Here's how it would look:\`\`\` 3.25+0.25------\`\`\`Now, I'll add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the hundredths place.In the hundredths place, I have 5 (from 3.25) and 5 (from 0.25). Adding these together gives me 10. Since 10 is more than 9, I need to carry over the extra to the tenths place. So, I'll write down 0 in the hundredths place and carry over 1 to the tenths place.Next, I move to the tenths place. Here, I have 2 (from 3.25) and 2 (from 0.25). Adding these together gives me 4. But I also have the 1 that I carried over from the hundredths place. So, 4 plus 1 equals 5. I'll write down 5 in the tenths place.Now, moving to the units place, I have 3 (from 3.25) and 0 (from 0.25). Adding these together gives me 3. There's no need to carry over anything here since 3 is less than 10. So, I'll write down 3 in the units place.Putting it all together, the sum is 3.50 pints.Wait a minute, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 3.25 plus 0.25 equals 3.50. That makes sense because 0.25 is a quarter, and adding a quarter to 3.25 would bring it up to 3.50, which is the same as 3 and a half pints.Just to be thorough, I'll try adding them in a different way. I know that 3.25 is the same as 3 and a quarter, and 0.25 is also a quarter. So, adding a quarter to 3 and a quarter would give me 3 and a half, which is 3.50. Yep, that checks out.Another way to think about it is to convert the decimals to fractions. 3.25 is the same as 3 and 1/4, and 0.25 is 1/4. Adding 1/4 and 1/4 gives me 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. So, 3 and 1/4 plus 1/4 equals 3 and 1/2, which is 3.50 in decimal form.I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The total amount of ice cream Alec and his roommates ate over the two nights is 3.50 pints."},{"question":"In a cooperative education alliance of six well-known schools in Guangdong, not only do they focus on improving students' academic performance, but they also emphasize enhancing students' comprehensive qualities. Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test. Assuming the probabilities of Groups A, B, C, and D passing the test are 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively, and that each group's test outcome is independent:1. Calculate the probability that at least three groups pass the test.2. Let X denote the number of groups that pass the test. Calculate the expected value of X.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about four groups (A, B, C, D) taking a test, each with their own probability of passing: 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.4 respectively. The first part asks for the probability that at least three groups pass the test. The second part is about finding the expected number of groups that pass, denoted as X.Starting with the first part: Probability that at least three groups pass. That means either exactly three groups pass or all four groups pass. So, I need to calculate both probabilities and add them together.First, let me recall that since each group's test outcome is independent, the probability of multiple events happening together is the product of their individual probabilities. So, for example, the probability that A passes and B passes is 0.6 * 0.5.But since I need the probability of exactly three groups passing, I need to consider all possible combinations where three groups pass and one fails. There are four groups, so the number of ways to choose three groups is 4 choose 3, which is 4. So, there are four different scenarios where exactly three groups pass.Wait, actually, hold on. The groups are A, B, C, D. So, the combinations for exactly three passing would be:1. A, B, C pass; D fails.2. A, B, D pass; C fails.3. A, C, D pass; B fails.4. B, C, D pass; A fails.So, four different cases. I need to calculate the probability for each case and then add them up.Similarly, for all four groups passing, it's just one case: A, B, C, D all pass.So, let me compute each probability step by step.First, let's compute the probability that exactly three groups pass.Case 1: A, B, C pass; D fails.Probability = P(A pass) * P(B pass) * P(C pass) * P(D fail)Which is 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.4) = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6Calculating that: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3; 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15; 0.15 * 0.6 = 0.09So, 0.09 for this case.Case 2: A, B, D pass; C fails.Probability = P(A pass) * P(B pass) * P(C fail) * P(D pass)Which is 0.6 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) * 0.4 = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4Calculating that: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3; 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15; 0.15 * 0.4 = 0.06So, 0.06 for this case.Case 3: A, C, D pass; B fails.Probability = P(A pass) * P(B fail) * P(C pass) * P(D pass)Which is 0.6 * (1 - 0.5) * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4Same as case 2, which is 0.06.Case 4: B, C, D pass; A fails.Probability = P(A fail) * P(B pass) * P(C pass) * P(D pass)Which is (1 - 0.6) * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4Calculating that: 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2; 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1; 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04So, 0.04 for this case.Now, adding up all four cases for exactly three groups passing:0.09 (Case 1) + 0.06 (Case 2) + 0.06 (Case 3) + 0.04 (Case 4) = 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25Wait, that's 0.25? Hmm, let me double-check.Case 1: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.09Case 2: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Case 3: Same as Case 2: 0.06Case 4: 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.04Adding them: 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25Okay, that seems correct.Now, the probability that all four groups pass.That's P(A pass) * P(B pass) * P(C pass) * P(D pass) = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4Calculating that: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3; 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15; 0.15 * 0.4 = 0.06So, 0.06.Therefore, the probability that at least three groups pass is the sum of exactly three passing and all four passing: 0.25 + 0.06 = 0.31Wait, that's 0.31? But in my initial calculation, I thought it was 0.48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no, hold on. Let me recalculate.Wait, in the initial problem statement, it says \\"six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D\\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Six teams but only four groups? Maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's four teams, A, B, C, D.But the user wrote: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, that's confusing. Six teams but only four groups? Maybe it's a translation issue. Maybe it's four teams, named A, B, C, D, each from a school, and there are six schools? Hmm, not sure. But the probabilities given are for four groups: A, B, C, D with probabilities 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4.So, perhaps it's four groups, not six. Maybe the original problem had six groups, but in the translation, it's four. Hmm.But in the problem, it's written as: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, that's six teams but only four groups. Maybe it's a mistranslation. Maybe it's four teams, each from a school, and the schools are six? Not sure. But since the probabilities given are for four groups: A, B, C, D, I think we can proceed with four groups.So, going back, I had four groups, A, B, C, D, with pass probabilities 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4.So, calculating the probability that at least three pass: exactly three or all four.Exactly three: 0.25All four: 0.06Total: 0.31But earlier, I thought it was 0.48. Maybe I miscalculated.Wait, let me recalculate the exactly three cases.Case 1: A, B, C pass; D fails.0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.09Case 2: A, B, D pass; C fails.0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Case 3: A, C, D pass; B fails.Same as Case 2: 0.06Case 4: B, C, D pass; A fails.0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.04Adding up: 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25All four: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Total: 0.25 + 0.06 = 0.31Hmm, so 0.31 is the probability that at least three groups pass.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the answer was 0.48, but that seems incorrect based on my calculations.Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.The problem says: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, so six teams but only four groups? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a translation issue, and it's actually four teams, each from a school, and there are six schools? But the problem mentions six schools, but only four groups. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe it's six groups, but the names are A, B, C, D, E, F, but the user only listed four probabilities. Wait, no, the user wrote: \\"the probabilities of Groups A, B, C, and D passing the test are 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively.\\"So, four groups with those probabilities.So, I think the problem is about four groups, not six. Maybe the initial statement was a mistranslation or misstatement.So, proceeding with four groups, A, B, C, D, with pass probabilities 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4.So, my calculation of 0.31 seems correct.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the probability was 0.48, which is higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe using the binomial coefficients.Wait, but since each group has a different probability, it's not a binomial distribution. It's a Poisson binomial distribution.So, to calculate P(X >= 3), we need to sum the probabilities of X=3 and X=4.To calculate P(X=3), we need to consider all combinations where exactly three groups pass.As before, there are four such combinations.Each combination's probability is the product of the pass probabilities of the three groups and the fail probability of the one group.So, let's compute each:1. A, B, C pass; D fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.092. A, B, D pass; C fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.063. A, C, D pass; B fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.064. B, C, D pass; A fails: 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.04Adding these: 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25Similarly, P(X=4) is 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06So, P(X >= 3) = 0.25 + 0.06 = 0.31Therefore, the probability that at least three groups pass is 0.31.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the answer was 0.48, which is different. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.Wait, let me check the initial problem again.It says: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, six teams but only four groups? That seems contradictory. Maybe it's a typo, and it's four teams, each from a school, and there are six schools? But the problem mentions six schools, but only four groups. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe it's six groups, but the names are A, B, C, D, E, F, but the user only listed four probabilities. Wait, no, the user wrote: \\"the probabilities of Groups A, B, C, and D passing the test are 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively.\\"So, four groups with those probabilities.So, I think the problem is about four groups, not six. Maybe the initial statement was a mistranslation or misstatement.So, proceeding with four groups, A, B, C, D, with pass probabilities 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4.So, my calculation of 0.31 seems correct.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the answer was 0.48, which is higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe using the binomial coefficients.Wait, but since each group has a different probability, it's not a binomial distribution. It's a Poisson binomial distribution.So, to calculate P(X >= 3), we need to sum the probabilities of X=3 and X=4.To calculate P(X=3), we need to consider all combinations where exactly three groups pass.As before, there are four such combinations.Each combination's probability is the product of the pass probabilities of the three groups and the fail probability of the one group.So, let's compute each:1. A, B, C pass; D fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.092. A, B, D pass; C fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.063. A, C, D pass; B fails: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.064. B, C, D pass; A fails: 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.04Adding these: 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25Similarly, P(X=4) is 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06So, P(X >= 3) = 0.25 + 0.06 = 0.31Therefore, the probability that at least three groups pass is 0.31.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the answer was 0.48, which is different. So, perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, maybe the user considered all six groups, but only four probabilities were given. Maybe the other two groups have pass probabilities as well, but they were not mentioned. That could be the case.Wait, the problem says: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, that's confusing. Six teams but only four groups. Maybe it's a typo, and it's four teams, each from a school, and there are six schools? But the problem mentions six schools, but only four groups. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe it's six groups, but the names are A, B, C, D, E, F, but the user only listed four probabilities. Wait, no, the user wrote: \\"the probabilities of Groups A, B, C, and D passing the test are 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively.\\"So, four groups with those probabilities.So, I think the problem is about four groups, not six. Maybe the initial statement was a mistranslation or misstatement.So, proceeding with four groups, A, B, C, D, with pass probabilities 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4.So, my calculation of 0.31 seems correct.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the answer was 0.48, which is higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, let me check the calculations again.Case 1: A, B, C pass; D fails.0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.09Case 2: A, B, D pass; C fails.0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Case 3: A, C, D pass; B fails.0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Case 4: B, C, D pass; A fails.0.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.04Adding these: 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.25All four pass: 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.06Total: 0.25 + 0.06 = 0.31Yes, that seems correct.So, perhaps the initial answer of 0.48 was incorrect.Now, moving on to the second part: Let X denote the number of groups that pass the test. Calculate the expected value of X.The expected value E[X] is the sum over all possible values of X multiplied by their probabilities. However, since each group's pass/fail is independent, we can use the linearity of expectation, which states that the expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values.So, E[X] = E[A] + E[B] + E[C] + E[D]Where E[A] is the expected value of group A passing, which is just the probability of A passing, which is 0.6.Similarly, E[B] = 0.5, E[C] = 0.5, E[D] = 0.4.So, E[X] = 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.4 = 2.0Wait, that's 2.0.But in the initial problem, the user wrote that the expected value was 2.12. Hmm, that's different.Wait, let me think. Maybe the user considered six groups, but only four probabilities were given. If there are six groups, but only four probabilities, perhaps the other two groups have probabilities as well, but they were not mentioned. That could be the case.Wait, the problem says: \\"Six teams, named Group A, B, C, and D, were formed by selecting students from each school to participate in a comprehensive quality test.\\"Wait, that's confusing.

Let me go through each one step by step.Starting with **Option A**: It says that if ( a > b > 0 ), then ( ac^2 > bc^2 ). Hmm, okay. So, if ( a ) is greater than ( b ) and both are positive, and we multiply both by ( c^2 ), then the inequality should hold, right? But wait, ( c^2 ) is always non-negative because any real number squared is non-negative. So, if ( c ) is zero, then ( ac^2 = 0 ) and ( bc^2 = 0 ), which means ( ac^2 = bc^2 ), not greater. So, in that case, the proposition isn't true for all ( c ). Therefore, **Option A** is not necessarily true.Moving on to **Option B**: It states that if ( a < b < 0 ), then ( a^2 < ab < b^2 ). Let's test this with some numbers. Suppose ( a = -3 ) and ( b = -2 ). Then, ( a^2 = 9 ), ( ab = 6 ), and ( b^2 = 4 ). So, according to this, ( 9 < 6 < 4 ), which is clearly not true. In fact, ( a^2 > ab > b^2 ) in this case. So, **Option B** is also not true.Next is **Option C**: It says that if ( a > b > 0 ) and ( c < 0 ), then ( frac{c}{a} > frac{c}{b} ). Let's break this down. Since ( a > b > 0 ), ( frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} ) because as the denominator increases, the fraction decreases. Now, since ( c ) is negative, multiplying both sides of the inequality ( frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} ) by ( c ) will reverse the inequality sign. So, ( frac{c}{a} > frac{c}{b} ). That makes sense. Let me test it with numbers. Let ( a = 4 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -1 ). Then, ( frac{c}{a} = -frac{1}{4} ) and ( frac{c}{b} = -frac{1}{2} ). Indeed, ( -frac{1}{4} > -frac{1}{2} ). So, **Option C** seems to be true.Finally, **Option D**: It claims that if ( a < b < 0 ), then ( frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} ). Let's test this with negative numbers. Suppose ( a = -4 ) and ( b = -2 ). Then, ( frac{1}{a} = -frac{1}{4} ) and ( frac{1}{b} = -frac{1}{2} ). Comparing these, ( -frac{1}{4} ) is greater than ( -frac{1}{2} ), so ( frac{1}{a} > frac{1}{b} ), which contradicts the proposition. Therefore, **Option D** is not true.After evaluating all four options, it seems that only **Option C** is true."},{"question":"A rectangle’s perimeter is twice the number of square inches in its area. If the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width, find the dimensions of the rectangle.","answer":"First, I need to define the variables for the width and length of the rectangle. Let ( w ) represent the width and ( l ) represent the length.Given that the length is three times the width, I can express this relationship as:[l = 3w]Next, I recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter ( P ) is calculated as:[P = 2l + 2w]And the area ( A ) is:[A = l times w]According to the problem, the perimeter is twice the area. This gives me the equation:[2l + 2w = 2(l times w)]Substituting the expression for ( l ) from the first equation into this equation:[2(3w) + 2w = 2(3w times w)][6w + 2w = 6w^2][8w = 6w^2]To solve for ( w ), I rearrange the equation:[6w^2 - 8w = 0][2w(3w - 4) = 0]This gives two possible solutions:[w = 0 quad text{or} quad w = frac{4}{3}]Since a width of 0 is not practical, I discard it and take:[w = frac{4}{3} text{ inches}]Finally, I find the length using the relationship ( l = 3w ):[l = 3 times frac{4}{3} = 4 text{ inches}]Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are:[text{Width} = boxed{frac{4}{3}} text{ inches}, quad text{Length} = boxed{4} text{ inches}]"},{"question":"What least number must be subtracted from 427398 so that the remaining number is divisible by 11?","answer":"First, I need to determine the least number that must be subtracted from 427398 to make the resulting number divisible by 11.I'll use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.Let's break down the number 427398 into its individual digits and identify their positions:- Digit 4 is in the 1st position (odd)- Digit 2 is in the 2nd position (even)- Digit 7 is in the 3rd position (odd)- Digit 3 is in the 4th position (even)- Digit 9 is in the 5th position (odd)- Digit 8 is in the 6th position (even)Next, I'll calculate the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions:- Sum of digits in odd positions: 4 + 7 + 9 = 20- Sum of digits in even positions: 2 + 3 + 8 = 13Now, I'll find the difference between these two sums:20 (sum of odd positions) - 13 (sum of even positions) = 7Since the difference is 7, which is not 0 or a multiple of 11, the number 427398 is not divisible by 11. To make it divisible by 11, I need to adjust this difference to the nearest multiple of 11. The closest multiple of 11 to 7 is 0.To achieve a difference of 0, I need to subtract 7 from 427398. This will make the resulting number divisible by 11.Therefore, the least number that must be subtracted from 427398 to make it divisible by 11 is 7."},{"question":"Among the following options, which cannot form a set?A: All positive numbersB: All elderly peopleC: Non-zero real numbersD: The four great inventions of ancient China","answer":"Okay, so I have this question here: \\"Among the following options, which cannot form a set?\\" The options are A: All positive numbers, B: All elderly people, C: Non-zero real numbers, and D: The four great inventions of ancient China. I need to figure out which one of these cannot form a set.First, I should remember what a set is in mathematics. A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, which are called elements or members of the set. The key thing here is that the set must be well-defined, meaning that it's clear whether any given object is or isn't in the set. There shouldn't be any ambiguity.Let's go through each option one by one.Option A: All positive numbers. Hmm, positive numbers are numbers greater than zero. That seems pretty clear. So, for example, 1, 2, 3, and so on are positive numbers, and numbers like 0.5 or π are also positive. It's a well-defined collection because I can determine whether any number is positive or not. So, this can form a set.Option B: All elderly people. Now, this is interesting. What defines an elderly person? I know that in many contexts, people consider someone elderly if they are above a certain age, like 65 or older. But is that universally agreed upon? I'm not sure. Different cultures or organizations might have different definitions. For example, some places might consider 60 as elderly, while others might say 70. So, if the definition of \\"elderly\\" isn't universally agreed upon, then it's not a well-defined collection. That means we can't clearly determine who is in the set and who isn't, which would make it impossible to form a set.Option C: Non-zero real numbers. Real numbers include all numbers that can be represented on a number line, both positive and negative, including fractions and irrational numbers. Non-zero real numbers would exclude zero but include everything else. That seems clear enough. I can easily determine if a number is a non-zero real number or not. So, this can form a set.Option D: The four great inventions of ancient China. I believe these are well-known and historically recognized. They are typically considered to be the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing. These are specific and agreed upon, so they form a well-defined set with four elements. Therefore, this can also form a set.So, going back to the options, A, C, and D all seem to form valid sets because their elements are clearly defined. However, option B, \\"All elderly people,\\" is problematic because the term \\"elderly\\" isn't universally defined. Different people or cultures might have different criteria for who is considered elderly, leading to ambiguity. Since a set requires clear membership criteria, this makes option B unable to form a set.I think that's the reasoning. To double-check, I can think about the definition of a set again. If the criteria for membership are not clear and consistent, then it's not a set. In this case, since \\"elderly\\" is subjective, it fails the well-definedness requirement. The other options have clear, objective criteria, so they can form sets without any issues.Another way to look at it is by considering examples. For A, I can list numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., and clearly say they are in the set. For C, any number except zero is in the set. For D, the four specific inventions are in the set. But for B, if I try to list \\"elderly people,\\" I might include someone who is 65, but another person might argue that 60 is elderly, or maybe even 70. There's no single agreed-upon age, so it's not clear who should be included or excluded.Therefore, my conclusion is that option B cannot form a set because it lacks a clear, universally accepted definition of what constitutes an \\"elderly person.\\""},{"question":"How many people are needed to be certain that at least two of them have the same birthday?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many people are needed to be certain that at least two of them have the same birthday. Hmm, this seems like a classic problem, but I want to make sure I understand it fully.First, I know there are 365 days in a year, right? Well, actually, there are 366 days if we consider leap years, but I think for this problem, we'll stick with 365 days because it's the standard assumption unless specified otherwise.So, if I have a group of people, and I want to make sure that at least two people share the same birthday, how big does that group need to be? I remember hearing about something called the pigeonhole principle, which might be relevant here. Let me think about that.The pigeonhole principle basically says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Translating that to birthdays, the \\"pigeonholes\\" are the days of the year, and the \\"pigeons\\" are the people. So, if we have more people than there are days in a year, then at least two people must share a birthday.But wait, does that mean if I have 365 people, each could potentially have a unique birthday? Yes, that's right. Each person could have a birthday on a different day, covering all 365 days. So, with 365 people, it's possible that everyone has a unique birthday.But the question is asking for the number of people needed to be certain that at least two share a birthday. So, if I have 365 people, it's not certain yet because they could all have unique birthdays. To make it certain, I need one more person. That would make it 366 people. With 366 people, even if the first 365 each have unique birthdays, the 366th person must share a birthday with someone else because there are only 365 days.Wait, but what about leap years? If we consider February 29th, does that change anything? Well, if we include leap years, there are 366 possible birthdays. So, in that case, would we need 367 people to ensure at least two share a birthday? Hmm, that's a good point. But I think the standard problem assumes 365 days, so maybe we don't need to worry about leap years here.Also, I should consider whether birthdays are equally likely on all days. In reality, some days might have more birthdays than others, but for the sake of this problem, I think we can assume that each day is equally likely.So, to summarize, if I have 365 people, it's possible for all of them to have unique birthdays. But once I add one more person, making it 366, it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. Therefore, the minimum number of people needed to be certain is 366.I think that makes sense. It's all about the pigeonhole principle and ensuring that with one more person than the number of days, you can't avoid having at least one shared birthday."},{"question":"The price of a cycle is reduced by 25 per cent. The new price is reduced by a further percentage. The two reductions together are equal to a single reduction of 70 per cent.

One is substitution, and the other is elimination. I think elimination might be easier here because both equations have a ( y ) term, so maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate ( y ).Let me write down the equations again:1. ( x + y = 5 )2. ( 3x + y = 7 )If I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, that should eliminate ( y ), right? Let's try that:[(3x + y) - (x + y) = 7 - 5]Simplifying the left side:[3x + y - x - y = 2x]And the right side:[7 - 5 = 2]So, I have:[2x = 2]To solve for ( x ), I divide both sides by 2:[x = 1]Okay, so ( x ) is 1. Now I need to find ( y ). I can plug this value back into either of the original equations. I'll use the first one because it looks simpler:[x + y = 5]Substituting ( x = 1 ):[1 + y = 5]Subtracting 1 from both sides:[y = 4]So, ( y ) is 4. Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I'll plug both values back into the second equation to verify:[3x + y = 7]Substituting ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ):[3(1) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7]Yep, that checks out. So, the solution should be ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ).Wait, just to be thorough, let me try solving it using substitution as well to see if I get the same answer. Starting with the first equation:[x + y = 5]I can solve for ( y ):[y = 5 - x]Now, substitute this expression for ( y ) into the second equation:[3x + (5 - x) = 7]Simplify:[3x + 5 - x = 7]Combine like terms:[2x + 5 = 7]Subtract 5 from both sides:[2x = 2]Divide by 2:[x = 1]Then, substitute back into ( y = 5 - x ):[y = 5 - 1 = 4]Same result! Okay, so both methods give me ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 4 ). I'm pretty confident that's the correct solution. Just to visualize, if I graph these two equations, they should intersect at the point (1, 4). The first equation is a straight line with a slope of -1 and a y-intercept at 5, and the second is a steeper line with a slope of -3 and the same y-intercept. Since they have different slopes, they should intersect at exactly one point, which is (1, 4). That makes sense.I think I've got it. The solution is ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 4 )."},{"question":"Given two integers a and b, if they are not coprime and neither is a multiple of the other, they are called a \\"league\\" pair. Let A be an n-element subset of the set M = {1, 2, cdots, 2014} such that every pair of numbers in A is a league pair. Determine the maximum value of n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum size of a subset A from the set M = {1, 2, ..., 2014} such that every pair of numbers in A is a \\"league\\" pair. A league pair is defined as two numbers that are not coprime and neither is a multiple of the other. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, I need to understand what a league pair really means. So, if I have two numbers a and b, they shouldn't be coprime, which means they must share at least one common divisor greater than 1. Also, neither a should divide b nor b should divide a. So, for example, 4 and 6 are a league pair because they share 2 as a common divisor, and neither divides the other. But 4 and 8 wouldn't be a league pair because 4 divides 8.Alright, so I need to create a subset where every pair satisfies these two conditions. My goal is to make this subset as large as possible. Let me think about how to approach this.One idea is to consider numbers that are all even. If I take all even numbers, then any two numbers will share 2 as a common divisor, so they won't be coprime. But wait, in that case, some numbers might be multiples of others. For example, 2 and 4 are both even, but 2 divides 4, so they wouldn't be a league pair. So, just taking all even numbers won't work because some pairs would have a divisibility relationship.Hmm, so maybe I need to exclude numbers that are multiples of each other. But how? If I take only even numbers that are not multiples of each other, that might work. But then, how do I ensure that none of them are multiples? That seems complicated because even numbers can still be multiples of each other.Wait, maybe I can take numbers that are all multiples of some number greater than 1, but not multiples of each other. For example, if I take numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of 4. Let's see: numbers like 2, 6, 10, 14, etc. These are all even, so they share the divisor 2, and none of them are multiples of each other because they are all 2 mod 4. So, 2 and 6: 2 doesn't divide 6? Wait, 2 does divide 6. Oh, right, so that doesn't work either.Hmm, so maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about prime numbers. If I take numbers that are multiples of a prime, say 2, but avoid taking numbers that are multiples of higher powers. Wait, but as I saw earlier, that doesn't solve the problem because smaller multiples will still divide larger ones.Maybe instead of focusing on a single prime, I can use multiple primes. For example, take numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3, but not multiples of each other. But then, I have to ensure that no two numbers are multiples of each other, which is still a challenge.Wait, another idea: maybe take numbers that are all composite and have a common factor, but are not multiples of each other. For example, numbers that are multiples of 4, but not multiples of 8. Let's see: 4, 12, 20, etc. These are all multiples of 4, so they share 4 as a common divisor, and none of them are multiples of each other because they are spaced by 8. So, 4 and 12: 4 doesn't divide 12? Wait, 4 does divide 12. So, that doesn't work either.This is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I need a different strategy. Let me think about the structure of such a subset. Since every pair must not be coprime, all numbers must share a common divisor. But if they share a common divisor, say d, then all numbers are multiples of d. However, if all numbers are multiples of d, then some of them might be multiples of each other, which we don't want.So, perhaps I can choose numbers that are multiples of d but not multiples of any higher multiple. For example, if d is 2, then numbers like 2, 6, 10, 14, etc., but as I saw earlier, 2 divides 6, so that's not good. Alternatively, if I take numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of 4, like 2, 6, 10, 14, etc. But again, 2 divides 6, so that doesn't work.Wait, maybe I can take numbers that are multiples of a higher number, like 6. So, numbers like 6, 12, 18, etc. But again, 6 divides 12, so that's not good. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can take numbers that are all multiples of some composite number, but not multiples of each other. For example, take numbers that are multiples of 4, but not multiples of 8, 12, etc. But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, another approach: maybe use the concept of antichains in posets. Since we're dealing with divisibility, the set M forms a poset under divisibility. An antichain is a set of elements where none of them are comparable, meaning none divides the other. So, if I can find an antichain where every pair shares a common divisor greater than 1, that would be my desired subset.But how large can such an antichain be? In the poset of divisors, the size of the largest antichain is given by Dilworth's theorem, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, Sperner's theorem tells us about the size of the largest antichain in the Boolean lattice, but again, not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of the largest antichain in the divisor lattice of M. The size of the largest antichain in {1, 2, ..., n} is equal to the number of elements with the middle binomial coefficient, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe I can look for numbers in a certain range where they are all composite and share a common factor, but are not multiples of each other. For example, numbers between 1008 and 2014. Let me check: 1008 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 7, so it's composite. Similarly, 1009 is prime, so I have to exclude that. Wait, but primes can't be in the subset because they are coprime with many numbers. So, maybe I should focus on composite numbers.But even among composite numbers, some might be multiples of others. For example, 1008 and 1512: 1008 divides 1512? Let me check: 1512 divided by 1008 is 1.5, so no, it's not a multiple. Wait, 1008 * 1.5 = 1512, but since 1.5 isn't an integer, 1008 doesn't divide 1512. So, maybe numbers in the upper half of M, say from 1008 to 2014, could form a good candidate.But wait, not all numbers in that range are composite. For example, 1009 is prime, so I have to exclude it. Similarly, 1013, 1019, etc., are primes. So, maybe I can take all composite numbers from 1008 to 2014. But how many are there?The total numbers from 1008 to 2014 is 1007 numbers. The number of primes in that range is approximately 1007 / log(1008) ≈ 1007 / 6.915 ≈ 145. So, roughly 145 primes, meaning about 1007 - 145 ≈ 862 composite numbers. But not all of these composite numbers will form a league pair with each other.Wait, but even among composite numbers, some might be coprime. For example, 1008 and 1009 are coprime, but 1009 is prime, so we already excluded it. But 1008 and 1010: 1008 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 7, and 1010 is 2 * 5 * 101. So, they share a common divisor of 2, so they are not coprime. Also, neither divides the other. So, 1008 and 1010 would be a league pair.Similarly, 1008 and 1012: 1012 is 4 * 253, so they share 4 as a common divisor, and neither divides the other. So, that works.But wait, what about 1008 and 1020? 1020 is 4 * 255, so they share 4, and neither divides the other. So, that's good.But what about two composite numbers that are coprime? For example, 1008 and 1025. Wait, 1025 is 5^2 * 41, so 1008 and 1025 share no common divisors except 1, right? Because 1008 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 7, and 1025 is 5^2 * 41. So, they are coprime. So, 1008 and 1025 would not be a league pair because they are coprime. So, that's a problem.So, if I take all composite numbers from 1008 to 2014, I might end up with some pairs that are coprime, which violates the condition. So, that approach might not work.Hmm, so maybe I need a different strategy. Let me think about taking numbers that are all even. If I take all even numbers from, say, 1008 to 2014, then any two numbers will share 2 as a common divisor, so they won't be coprime. Also, since they are all even, none of them will divide each other because they are all greater than 1008, and the smallest even number is 1008, so 1008 * 2 = 2016, which is beyond 2014. So, none of them can divide each other because doubling the smallest would exceed the maximum.Wait, that sounds promising. Let me check: if I take all even numbers from 1008 to 2014, how many are there? The numbers are 1008, 1010, 1012, ..., 2014. The count is (2014 - 1008)/2 + 1 = (1006)/2 + 1 = 503 + 1 = 504 numbers.Now, let's verify the conditions:1. No two numbers are coprime: Since all are even, they share 2 as a common divisor, so they are not coprime.2. No two numbers divide each other: The smallest number is 1008, and the next one is 1010. 1008 * 2 = 2016, which is beyond 2014, so none of the numbers can be a multiple of another within the subset. Therefore, no two numbers divide each other.So, this subset of 504 even numbers from 1008 to 2014 satisfies both conditions of being a league pair for every pair. Therefore, n can be at least 504.But is this the maximum? Could there be a larger subset?Suppose there is a subset A with more than 504 elements. Let's assume A has 505 elements. Since the total number of even numbers from 1008 to 2014 is 504, any additional number would have to be odd. But if we include an odd number, say x, then x must form a league pair with every other number in A.But x is odd, and all other numbers in A are even. So, x and any even number share a common divisor of 1, because x is odd and the even numbers are multiples of 2. Therefore, x and any even number are coprime, which violates the league pair condition. Hence, we cannot include any odd numbers in the subset without violating the condition.Therefore, the maximum size of such a subset A is indeed 504.Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose instead of taking all even numbers from 1008 to 2014, I take some other numbers. Maybe numbers that are multiples of 3 or something else. But then, similar issues arise: some numbers might be multiples of others, or some pairs might be coprime.Alternatively, what if I take numbers that are multiples of 4? Let's see: numbers like 4, 8, 12, ..., up to 2012. But then, 4 divides 8, which violates the league pair condition. So, that doesn't work.What if I take numbers that are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 8? So, numbers like 4, 12, 20, ..., up to 2004. These are numbers congruent to 4 mod 8. Let's see: 4 and 12: 4 divides 12, so that's bad. So, that doesn't work either.Hmm, maybe taking numbers that are multiples of a higher number, like 6. So, numbers like 6, 12, 18, ..., up to 2010. But again, 6 divides 12, so that's not good.Wait, maybe if I take numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of 4. So, numbers like 2, 6, 10, 14, ..., up to 2010. Let's see: 2 and 6: 2 divides 6, so that's bad. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, if I take numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of any smaller even number. Wait, that's not possible because 2 is the smallest even number.Hmm, maybe I need to consider a different structure. What if I take numbers that are all multiples of some prime p, but not multiples of p^2? For example, take numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of 4. But as I saw earlier, 2 divides 6, so that's not good.Alternatively, take numbers that are multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9. But then, 3 divides 6, which is also a multiple of 3, so that's bad.Wait, maybe I can take numbers that are multiples of a composite number, like 6, but not multiples of 12. So, numbers like 6, 18, 30, ..., up to 2010. Let's see: 6 and 18: 6 divides 18, so that's bad.Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe the initial idea of taking all even numbers from 1008 to 2014 is actually the best approach because it naturally avoids the divisibility issue and ensures that all pairs share a common divisor.So, to recap: taking all even numbers from 1008 to 2014 gives us 504 numbers. Each pair shares 2 as a common divisor, so they are not coprime. Also, since the smallest number is 1008, doubling it would exceed 2014, so none of the numbers can divide another. Therefore, every pair is a league pair.Since adding any other number (like an odd number) would result in some pairs being coprime, which violates the condition, 504 seems to be the maximum possible size.I think that makes sense. So, the maximum value of n is 504."},{"question":"The maximum number of students among them 4261 pens, 2677 pencils, 1759 erasers, and 1423 notebooks can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens, the same number of pencils, the same number of erasers, and the same number of notebooks, while ensuring that each student receives a non-zero number of each item and no two students have the same combination of items is:","answer":"First, I need to determine the maximum number of students among whom 4261 pens, 2677 pencils, 1759 erasers, and 1423 notebooks can be distributed evenly. Each student should receive the same number of each item, and no two students should have the same combination of items.To achieve this, I'll calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the quantities of pens, pencils, erasers, and notebooks. The GCD will indicate the largest number of students that can receive the same number of each item without any remainder.Starting with the first two numbers:- GCD(4261, 2677) = 1Next, I'll find the GCD of this result with the third number:- GCD(1, 1759) = 1Finally, I'll find the GCD of this result with the fourth number:- GCD(1, 1423) = 1Since the GCD of all four numbers is 1, it means that the items cannot be distributed evenly among any number of students greater than 1. Therefore, the only way to distribute the items evenly is to give them all to a single student.Additionally, the condition that no two students should have the same combination of items is trivially satisfied when there is only one student.Thus, the maximum number of students among whom the items can be distributed evenly, with each student receiving a non-zero number of each item and no two students having the same combination of items, is 1."},{"question":"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_2=2 and a_3=4.

Find the central angle in radians and the length of the chord AB.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a sector of a circle. The sector is called OAB, and it has an area of 1 cm² and a perimeter of 4 cm. I need to find the central angle in radians and the length of the chord AB. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the area of a sector is given by the formula:[ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} R^2 theta ]where ( R ) is the radius of the circle and ( theta ) is the central angle in radians. The problem says the area is 1 cm², so I can write:[ frac{1}{2} R^2 theta = 1 ]That's one equation. Now, the perimeter of the sector is given as 4 cm. The perimeter of a sector includes the two radii and the arc length. The arc length ( L ) is given by:[ L = R theta ]So, the perimeter ( P ) is:[ P = 2R + R theta ]And this is equal to 4 cm. So, I can write:[ 2R + R theta = 4 ]Now, I have two equations:1. ( frac{1}{2} R^2 theta = 1 )2. ( 2R + R theta = 4 )I need to solve these two equations to find ( R ) and ( theta ). Let me see how to do that.First, maybe I can solve the second equation for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the first equation. Let's try that.From the second equation:[ 2R + R theta = 4 ]I can factor out ( R ):[ R (2 + theta) = 4 ]So,[ R = frac{4}{2 + theta} ]Okay, so now I have ( R ) expressed in terms of ( theta ). Let me substitute this into the first equation.First equation:[ frac{1}{2} R^2 theta = 1 ]Substituting ( R = frac{4}{2 + theta} ):[ frac{1}{2} left( frac{4}{2 + theta} right)^2 theta = 1 ]Let me simplify this step by step.First, square ( frac{4}{2 + theta} ):[ left( frac{4}{2 + theta} right)^2 = frac{16}{(2 + theta)^2} ]So, plugging back into the equation:[ frac{1}{2} times frac{16}{(2 + theta)^2} times theta = 1 ]Simplify ( frac{1}{2} times 16 ):[ frac{8}{(2 + theta)^2} times theta = 1 ]So,[ frac{8 theta}{(2 + theta)^2} = 1 ]Now, I can write this as:[ 8 theta = (2 + theta)^2 ]Let me expand the right-hand side:[ (2 + theta)^2 = 4 + 4 theta + theta^2 ]So, the equation becomes:[ 8 theta = 4 + 4 theta + theta^2 ]Let me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:[ 8 theta - 4 - 4 theta - theta^2 = 0 ]Simplify:[ (8 theta - 4 theta) - 4 - theta^2 = 0 ][ 4 theta - 4 - theta^2 = 0 ]Let me rearrange the terms:[ -theta^2 + 4 theta - 4 = 0 ]It's usually nicer to have the quadratic term positive, so I'll multiply both sides by -1:[ theta^2 - 4 theta + 4 = 0 ]Now, this is a quadratic equation in ( theta ). Let me try to factor it.Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to -4. Hmm, -2 and -2.So,[ (theta - 2)^2 = 0 ]Therefore, the solution is:[ theta = 2 ]So, the central angle is 2 radians. Now, let me find the radius ( R ).From earlier, we had:[ R = frac{4}{2 + theta} ]Substituting ( theta = 2 ):[ R = frac{4}{2 + 2} = frac{4}{4} = 1 ]So, the radius ( R ) is 1 cm.Now, I need to find the length of the chord AB. To find the length of a chord given the central angle and radius, I can use the formula:[ text{Chord length} = 2 R sin left( frac{theta}{2} right) ]Plugging in the values:[ AB = 2 times 1 times sin left( frac{2}{2} right) = 2 sin(1) ]So, the length of chord AB is ( 2 sin(1) ) cm.Wait, let me double-check the chord length formula. I recall that the chord length is ( 2 R sin left( frac{theta}{2} right) ). Yes, that's correct because in the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord, the chord is opposite the angle ( theta ), and using the sine of half the angle gives the half-length of the chord.So, with ( R = 1 ) and ( theta = 2 ), we have:[ AB = 2 times 1 times sin(1) = 2 sin(1) ]Which is approximately ( 2 times 0.8415 approx 1.683 ) cm, but since the problem doesn't specify rounding, I should leave it in terms of sine.Therefore, the central angle is 2 radians, and the chord AB is ( 2 sin(1) ) cm.**Final Answer**The central angle is boxed{2} radians and the length of the chord ( AB ) is boxed{2sin 1} centimeters."},{"question":"A number x is equal to 7cdot24cdot48.

Hmm, let's see. The domain of a function is basically all the real numbers for which the function is defined, right? So, I need to find all the x-values that won't make the function undefined or result in any mathematical errors.First, I notice that there's a square root in the numerator, ( sqrt{x + 1} ). I remember that the expression inside a square root has to be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, that means ( x + 1 ) has to be greater than or equal to zero. Let me write that down:( x + 1 geq 0 )Solving for x, I subtract 1 from both sides:( x geq -1 )Okay, so x has to be greater than or equal to -1. That gives me one condition for the domain.Next, I look at the denominator, which is just x. I know that division by zero is undefined, so x cannot be zero. That gives me another condition:( x neq 0 )So now I have two conditions:1. ( x geq -1 )2. ( x neq 0 )I need to combine these two conditions to find the domain. So, x has to be greater than or equal to -1, but it can't be zero. That means x can be any real number from -1 up to, but not including, zero, and then from zero to positive infinity.In interval notation, this would be written as two separate intervals:- From -1 to 0, including -1 but not including 0: ( [-1, 0) )- From 0 to infinity, not including 0: ( (0, infty) )So, combining these two intervals, the domain is ( [-1, 0) cup (0, infty) ).Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The square root requires ( x + 1 geq 0 ), which gives ( x geq -1 ). The denominator can't be zero, so ( x neq 0 ). Combining these, x can be any number starting at -1, but skipping zero. That seems right.I don't think there are any other restrictions here. The numerator is a square root, which only restricts the inside to be non-negative, and the denominator just can't be zero. So, I think I've covered all the necessary conditions.Just to visualize, if I were to graph this function, it would be defined for all x from -1 onwards, but there would be a vertical asymptote at x = 0 because the function isn't defined there. So, the graph would approach infinity as x approaches zero from the right and negative infinity as x approaches zero from the left, but it wouldn't actually touch zero.Also, at x = -1, the square root becomes zero, so the function value there would be zero. That's okay because the denominator isn't zero at that point. So, the function is defined at x = -1, which is why we include it in the interval.I think that's all. I don't see any other potential issues with the function. The only restrictions are from the square root and the denominator, and I've accounted for both. So, I feel confident that the domain is ( [-1, 0) cup (0, infty) )."},{"question":"There are some integers between a certain number and 10000 that have no digits other than 4, 5, or 6.

What is the lower limit of the range?","answer":"First, I need to determine the smallest number that consists only of the digits 4, 5, and 6 and is part of a set of 81 such numbers that extend up to 10000.I'll start by considering the number of digits in these integers. Since the upper limit is 10000, the integers can have at most 4 digits. I'll categorize the numbers based on the number of digits:1. **One-digit numbers**: There are 3 possibilities (4, 5, 6).2. **Two-digit numbers**: There are 3 possibilities for the first digit and 3 for the second digit, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 possibilities.3. **Three-digit numbers**: Similarly, there are 3 possibilities for each digit, giving us 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 possibilities.4. **Four-digit numbers**: There are 3 possibilities for each digit, giving us 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 possibilities.Since we are looking for 81 such integers, it seems that we are looking for all the four-digit numbers that consist only of the digits 4, 5, and 6. The smallest four-digit number that can be formed using only these digits is 4444.To verify that 4444 is the lower limit, I'll check if there are indeed 81 numbers between 4444 and 10000 that consist only of the digits 4, 5, and 6.

I know that ( sqrt{7} ) is an irrational number, which means it has a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansion. But I also remember that ( sqrt{4} = 2 ) and ( sqrt{9} = 3 ), so ( sqrt{7} ) must be somewhere between 2 and 3. Let me check that: ( 2^2 = 4 ) and ( 3^2 = 9 ), and since 7 is between 4 and 9, ( sqrt{7} ) is indeed between 2 and 3.So, if ( sqrt{7} ) is between 2 and 3, its integer part is 2, and the decimal part is what's left after subtracting 2. That means ( a = sqrt{7} - 2 ). Okay, that makes sense.Now, the problem asks for ( (sqrt{7} + 2)a ). Since I already have ( a ) expressed in terms of ( sqrt{7} ), I can substitute that in. So, let's write that out:[(sqrt{7} + 2)a = (sqrt{7} + 2)(sqrt{7} - 2)]Wait a minute, this looks familiar. It's in the form of ( (x + y)(x - y) ), which is a difference of squares. I remember that ( (x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2 ). Let me apply that here.So, substituting ( x = sqrt{7} ) and ( y = 2 ), we get:[(sqrt{7} + 2)(sqrt{7} - 2) = (sqrt{7})^2 - (2)^2]Calculating each term:[(sqrt{7})^2 = 7][(2)^2 = 4]So, subtracting these:[7 - 4 = 3]Therefore, ( (sqrt{7} + 2)a = 3 ).Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, ( a = sqrt{7} - 2 ), and when I multiply ( (sqrt{7} + 2) ) by ( (sqrt{7} - 2) ), it's indeed a difference of squares, which simplifies to ( 7 - 4 = 3 ). Yeah, that seems right.I guess another way to think about it is to actually approximate ( sqrt{7} ) and see if the result makes sense. I know that ( sqrt{7} ) is approximately 2.6458. So, the decimal part ( a ) would be about 0.6458. Then, ( sqrt{7} + 2 ) is approximately 4.6458. Multiplying these together: 4.6458 * 0.6458 ≈ 3.

So, we have a positive integer ( n ), and when we take the sum of any two of its positive divisors, we get unique sums.

Our goal is to find the value of ( n ).First, I need to recall that the positive divisors of a number ( n ) include 1 and ( n ) itself, as well as any other numbers that divide ( n ) without leaving a remainder. So, if ( n ) has divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ), then the sums of every pair ( d_i + d_j ) (where ( i < j )) should give us the list of sums provided.Looking at the given sums, the smallest sum is 4, and the largest is 60. The smallest sum is likely the sum of the two smallest divisors, which are 1 and the smallest prime factor of ( n ). Let's denote the smallest prime factor as ( p ). So, ( 1 + p = 4 ), which implies ( p = 3 ). Therefore, 3 is the smallest prime factor of ( n ).Next, the largest sum is 60, which is probably the sum of the two largest divisors. The largest divisor of ( n ) is ( n ) itself, and the second largest divisor would be ( n ) divided by the smallest prime factor, which is 3. So, we can write the equation:[n + frac{n}{3} = 60]Simplifying this equation:[frac{4n}{3} = 60][4n = 180][n = 45]So, ( n ) could be 45.

This matches exactly with the given sums.Therefore, the value of ( n ) is indeed 45."},{"question":"A bag of popcorn kernels contains frac{3}{4} white kernels and frac{1}{4} yellow kernels. frac{1}{4} of the kernels in the bag are damaged and won't pop regardless of their color. Out of the good kernels, frac{3}{5} of the white kernels will pop, and frac{4}{5} of the yellow ones will pop. A kernel is selected at random from the bag and pops when placed in the popper. What is the probability that the kernel selected was white?textbf{(A)} frac{5}{13} qquadtextbf{(B)} frac{9}{13} qquadtextbf{(C)} frac{8}{13} qquadtextbf{(D)} frac{10}{13} qquadtextbf{(E)} frac{11}{13}","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem about popcorn kernels, and I need to find the probability that a kernel selected at random was white, given that it popped. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, the bag has 3/4 white kernels and 1/4 yellow kernels. So, if I imagine the bag, most of the kernels are white, and a smaller portion are yellow. Now, 1/4 of all the kernels are damaged and won't pop, regardless of their color. That means both white and yellow kernels have a 1/4 chance of being damaged. So, out of the white kernels, 1/4 are damaged, and the same goes for yellow kernels. That leaves 3/4 of the white kernels as good, and 3/4 of the yellow kernels as good. Now, out of these good kernels, 3/5 of the white ones will pop, and 4/5 of the yellow ones will pop. I think I need to use conditional probability here. The question is asking for the probability that the kernel was white given that it popped. So, in probability terms, I need to find P(White | Popped). From what I remember, conditional probability is calculated as P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). So, in this case, P(White | Popped) = P(White and Popped) / P(Popped). Alright, so I need to find P(White and Popped) and P(Popped). Let's start with P(White and Popped). First, the probability that a kernel is white is 3/4. Then, the probability that a white kernel is not damaged is 3/4 (since 1/4 are damaged). So, the probability that a kernel is white and not damaged is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Now, out of these good white kernels, 3/5 will pop. So, the probability that a kernel is white, not damaged, and pops is (9/16) * (3/5) = 27/80. Similarly, for yellow kernels, the probability that a kernel is yellow is 1/4. The probability that a yellow kernel is not damaged is also 3/4, so the probability that a kernel is yellow and not damaged is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Out of these good yellow kernels, 4/5 will pop. So, the probability that a kernel is yellow, not damaged, and pops is (3/16) * (4/5) = 12/80, which simplifies to 3/20. Now, to find P(Popped), the total probability that a kernel pops, I need to add the probabilities of popping for white and yellow kernels. So, P(Popped) = P(White and Popped) + P(Yellow and Popped) = 27/80 + 12/80 = 39/80. Wait, 27/80 plus 12/80 is 39/80. That seems right. Now, going back to the conditional probability formula, P(White | Popped) = P(White and Popped) / P(Popped) = (27/80) / (39/80). Oh, the 80s cancel out, so it's 27/39. Simplifying that, both 27 and 39 are divisible by 3. 27 divided by 3 is 9, and 39 divided by 3 is 13. So, it simplifies to 9/13. Hmm, that seems to match one of the answer choices. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1. Calculated the probability of white and popped: 3/4 * 3/4 * 3/5 = 27/80. 2. Calculated the probability of yellow and popped: 1/4 * 3/4 * 4/5 = 12/80. 3. Added them together for total popped: 27/80 + 12/80 = 39/80. 4. Divided white popped by total popped: 27/80 ÷ 39/80 = 27/39 = 9/13. Everything seems to check out. So, I think the answer is 9/13."},{"question":"Each of the 33 warriors either always lies or always tells the truth. It is known that each warrior has exactly one favorite weapon: a sword, a spear, an axe, or a bow.One day, Uncle Chernomor asked each warrior four questions:- Is your favorite weapon a sword?- Is your favorite weapon a spear?- Is your favorite weapon an axe?- Is your favorite weapon a bow?13 warriors answered \\"yes\\" to the first question, 15 warriors answered \\"yes\\" to the second question, 20 warriors answered \\"yes\\" to the third question, and 27 warriors answered \\"yes\\" to the fourth question.How many of the warriors always tell the truth?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem about 33 warriors, each either always telling the truth or always lying. Each warrior has a favorite weapon: sword, spear, axe, or bow. Uncle Chernomor asked each warrior four questions about their favorite weapon, and we know how many answered \\"yes\\" to each question. The numbers are 13 for sword, 15 for spear, 20 for axe, and 27 for bow. I need to figure out how many warriors always tell the truth.Alright, let's break this down. First, each warrior has exactly one favorite weapon, so when asked about their favorite weapon, a truthful warrior would say \\"yes\\" to exactly one of the four questions and \\"no\\" to the other three. On the other hand, a liar would say \\"yes\\" to the three questions that are not about their favorite weapon and \\"no\\" to the one that is. Wait, no, actually, if they always lie, then when asked if their favorite weapon is a sword, for example, they would say \\"yes\\" if it's not a sword and \\"no\\" if it is. So, a liar would say \\"yes\\" to three questions and \\"no\\" to one.So, for each warrior, if they're truthful, they contribute exactly one \\"yes\\" to the total count. If they're liars, they contribute exactly three \\"yes\\" answers. So, the total number of \\"yes\\" answers should be equal to the number of truthful warriors plus three times the number of lying warriors.Let me denote the number of truthful warriors as T and the number of lying warriors as L. We know that T + L = 33 because there are 33 warriors in total. The total number of \\"yes\\" answers is 13 + 15 + 20 + 27. Let me calculate that: 13 + 15 is 28, 20 + 27 is 47, so 28 + 47 is 75. So, the total number of \\"yes\\" answers is 75.From the earlier reasoning, the total \\"yes\\" answers can also be expressed as T + 3L. So, we have the equation:T + 3L = 75But we also know that T + L = 33. So, we have a system of two equations:1. T + L = 332. T + 3L = 75I can solve this system to find T and L. Let me subtract the first equation from the second:(T + 3L) - (T + L) = 75 - 33Simplifying:T + 3L - T - L = 42Which becomes:2L = 42So, L = 21. Then, plugging back into the first equation:T + 21 = 33So, T = 12.Wait, so there are 12 truthful warriors and 21 liars. Let me verify this. If there are 12 truthful warriors, they each say \\"yes\\" once, contributing 12 \\"yes\\" answers. The 21 liars each say \\"yes\\" three times, contributing 63 \\"yes\\" answers. 12 + 63 is indeed 75, which matches the total number of \\"yes\\" answers given. So, that seems consistent.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think through it again. Each truthful warrior says \\"yes\\" once, so 12 truthful warriors contribute 12 \\"yes\\" answers. Each liar says \\"yes\\" three times, so 21 liars contribute 63 \\"yes\\" answers. 12 + 63 equals 75, which is the total number of \\"yes\\" answers across all four questions. That checks out.Also, the number of warriors adds up: 12 + 21 = 33, which is the total number of warriors. So, both conditions are satisfied.I think that makes sense. So, the number of warriors who always tell the truth is 12."},{"question":"Find the domain of the expression frac{sqrt{x+3}}{sqrt{8-x}}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the domain of this expression: (frac{sqrt{x+3}}{sqrt{8-x}}). Hmm, the domain of an expression refers to all the real numbers (x) for which the expression is defined. Since this expression has square roots in both the numerator and the denominator, I need to make sure that the expressions inside those square roots are valid and that the denominator isn't zero because division by zero is undefined.First, let me look at the numerator: (sqrt{x+3}). For a square root to be defined, the expression inside it has to be greater than or equal to zero. So, I can write that as:(x + 3 geq 0)Solving for (x), I subtract 3 from both sides:(x geq -3)Okay, so (x) has to be greater than or equal to (-3) for the numerator to be defined.Now, moving on to the denominator: (sqrt{8 - x}). Similar to the numerator, the expression inside the square root needs to be greater than or equal to zero. However, since this is in the denominator, we also have to ensure that the denominator isn't zero because division by zero is undefined. So, the expression inside the square root must be strictly greater than zero:(8 - x > 0)Solving for (x), I can subtract 8 from both sides or rearrange it:(-x > -8)Multiplying both sides by (-1) (and remembering to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative):(x < 8)So, (x) has to be less than 8 for the denominator to be defined and non-zero.Now, combining both conditions:1. (x geq -3) (from the numerator)2. (x < 8) (from the denominator)The domain of the expression is all real numbers (x) that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. So, (x) must be greater than or equal to (-3) and less than 8. In interval notation, this is written as:([-3, 8))Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The numerator requires (x + 3) to be non-negative, which gives (x geq -3). The denominator requires (8 - x) to be positive, which gives (x < 8). There's no overlap issue here because (-3) is less than 8, so the interval from (-3) to 8 is valid. Also, since the denominator can't be zero, we don't include 8 in the domain.I think that's it. The domain should be all real numbers from (-3) up to, but not including, 8."},{"question":"There are ninety-eight cats in the little town.

The problem also mentions that the total moles of ammonium chloride formed are 3. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because it's saying both that some moles of ammonia are used and that the total moles of ammonium chloride are 3. Maybe I need to figure out how much ammonia is needed to react with 3 moles of HCl to produce 3 moles of NH4Cl.First, I should probably write down the chemical equation for this reaction. Ammonia is NH3, hydrochloric acid is HCl, and ammonium chloride is NH4Cl. So the reaction should look something like:NH3 + HCl → NH4ClNow, I need to balance this equation to make sure the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides. Let's see, on the left side, I have 1 N from NH3, 3 H from NH3, 1 H from HCl, and 1 Cl from HCl. On the right side, I have 1 N, 4 H, and 1 Cl. So, the nitrogen and chlorine are balanced, but the hydrogen isn't. There are 4 H on the right and only 4 H on the left (3 from NH3 and 1 from HCl). Wait, that actually balances out. So the equation is already balanced as written.Okay, so the balanced equation is:NH3 + HCl → NH4ClThis tells me that 1 mole of NH3 reacts with 1 mole of HCl to produce 1 mole of NH4Cl. So the mole ratio is 1:1:1.If I have 3 moles of HCl, and assuming I have enough NH3 to react completely with the HCl, then I should get 3 moles of NH4Cl. That matches what the problem is saying—the total moles of ammonium chloride formed are 3.But wait, the problem says \\"some moles of ammonia\\" and \\"3 moles of hydrochloric acid,\\" and the total moles of ammonium chloride formed are 3. So, if I have 3 moles of HCl and the reaction produces 3 moles of NH4Cl, that means I must have used 3 moles of NH3 as well, right? Because the mole ratio is 1:1.So, in this case, the number of moles of ammonium chloride formed is 3, which is the same as the number of moles of HCl used. That makes sense because for every mole of HCl, you get one mole of NH4Cl.But I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions \\"some moles of ammonia.\\" Does that mean that ammonia is the limiting reactant? If that's the case, then the amount of NH4Cl produced would depend on how much NH3 is available. But the problem also says that the total moles of NH4Cl formed are 3, which matches the moles of HCl used. So maybe ammonia is in excess, and HCl is the limiting reactant.In that scenario, the amount of NH4Cl produced would be determined by the amount of HCl, which is 3 moles. So, regardless of how much ammonia is present, as long as there's enough to react with all the HCl, the moles of NH4Cl formed would be 3.But if ammonia were the limiting reactant, then the moles of NH4Cl would depend on how much NH3 is available. For example, if I only had 2 moles of NH3, then only 2 moles of NH4Cl would be formed, and there would be 1 mole of HCl left unreacted.But since the problem states that the total moles of NH4Cl formed are 3, and we have 3 moles of HCl, it's likely that ammonia is in excess, and HCl is completely consumed to produce 3 moles of NH4Cl.So, to summarize, the reaction between ammonia and hydrochloric acid produces ammonium chloride in a 1:1:1 mole ratio. With 3 moles of HCl and assuming sufficient NH3, 3 moles of NH4Cl are formed."},{"question":"Determine all x for which lfloor lfloor 3x rfloor + 1/3 rfloor = lfloor x + 5 rfloor.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Determine all x for which floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) equals floor(x + 5). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with the floor functions nested inside each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, I know that the floor function, denoted by floor(y), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to y. So, for example, floor(2.3) is 2, and floor(3.999) is 3. It essentially rounds down to the nearest integer.Looking at the equation: floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) = floor(x + 5). Let me analyze the left side first. The inner floor function is floor(3x). Since floor(3x) is an integer, adding 1/3 to it will give a number that's 1/3 more than an integer. For example, if floor(3x) is 2, then floor(3x) + 1/3 is 2.333... So, when we take the floor of that, it should just be the integer part, right? Because 2.333... floored is still 2. So, essentially, floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) is just floor(3x). That simplifies the equation a bit.So now, the equation becomes floor(3x) = floor(x + 5). That seems more manageable. Let me denote floor(x) as m, where m is an integer. So, m ≤ x < m + 1. Then, floor(x + 5) would be floor(x) + 5, which is m + 5. So, the equation simplifies further to floor(3x) = m + 5.Now, I need to find x such that floor(3x) equals m + 5, where m is floor(x). Let's think about what floor(3x) can be. If x is between m and m + 1, then 3x is between 3m and 3m + 3. So, floor(3x) can be 3m, 3m + 1, or 3m + 2, depending on where x is in the interval [m, m + 1).So, let's break it down into cases based on the value of x within [m, m + 1):Case 1: x is in [m, m + 1/3). Then, 3x is in [3m, 3m + 1). So, floor(3x) = 3m. Therefore, the equation becomes 3m = m + 5. Solving for m, we get 2m = 5, so m = 5/2. But m has to be an integer, right? Since m is floor(x), which is an integer. So, m = 5/2 is not an integer, which means there's no solution in this case.Case 2: x is in [m + 1/3, m + 2/3). Then, 3x is in [3m + 1, 3m + 2). So, floor(3x) = 3m + 1. Plugging into the equation: 3m + 1 = m + 5. Solving for m, we get 2m = 4, so m = 2. That's an integer, so this is valid. Now, x is in [m + 1/3, m + 2/3), which with m = 2 becomes [2 + 1/3, 2 + 2/3), which is [7/3, 8/3). So, x is in [7/3, 8/3).Case 3: x is in [m + 2/3, m + 1). Then, 3x is in [3m + 2, 3m + 3). So, floor(3x) = 3m + 2. Plugging into the equation: 3m + 2 = m + 5. Solving for m, we get 2m = 3, so m = 3/2. Again, m needs to be an integer, so this is not valid.So, the only valid case is Case 2, where m = 2, and x is in [7/3, 8/3). Let me double-check that. If x is in [7/3, 8/3), then 3x is in [7, 8). So, floor(3x) is 7. Then, floor(3x) + 1/3 is 7 + 1/3, which is 7.333..., and floor of that is 7. On the right side, floor(x + 5). Since x is in [7/3, 8/3), x + 5 is in [5 + 7/3, 5 + 8/3), which is [22/3, 23/3). So, floor(x + 5) is 7 because 22/3 is approximately 7.333... and 23/3 is approximately 7.666..., so the floor is 7. So, both sides equal 7, which checks out.Wait, but hold on. The original equation was floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) = floor(x + 5). So, in this case, floor(3x) is 7, then 7 + 1/3 is 7.333..., and floor of that is 7. On the other side, floor(x + 5) is 7 as we saw. So, it's correct.Is there any other possible m? Let me think. Suppose m is 3, then x is in [3, 4). Then, 3x is in [9, 12). So, floor(3x) could be 9, 10, or 11. Let's see if any of these satisfy floor(3x) = m + 5. If m = 3, then m + 5 = 8. But floor(3x) is at least 9, which is greater than 8. So, no solution here.Similarly, if m = 1, then x is in [1, 2). Then, 3x is in [3, 6). So, floor(3x) could be 3, 4, or 5. Then, m + 5 = 6. So, floor(3x) needs to be 6, but 3x is less than 6, so floor(3x) is at most 5. So, no solution here either.What about m = 0? Then x is in [0, 1). 3x is in [0, 3). So, floor(3x) is 0, 1, or 2. m + 5 = 5. So, floor(3x) needs to be 5, but 3x is less than 3, so floor(3x) is at most 2. No solution.Similarly, for negative m, let's say m = -1. Then x is in [-1, 0). 3x is in [-3, 0). So, floor(3x) is -3, -2, or -1. m + 5 = 4. So, floor(3x) needs to be 4, but it's negative. No solution.So, it seems the only valid m is 2, giving x in [7/3, 8/3). Wait, but 8/3 is approximately 2.666..., and 7/3 is approximately 2.333... So, x is between 2.333... and 2.666...Let me test a value in this interval. Let's take x = 2.5, which is 5/2. Then, 3x = 7.5, so floor(3x) = 7. Then, floor(3x) + 1/3 is 7 + 1/3, which is approximately 7.333..., so floor of that is 7. On the other side, x + 5 = 7.5, so floor(x + 5) is 7. So, both sides are equal. Good.Another test: x = 7/3, which is approximately 2.333... Then, 3x = 7, so floor(3x) = 7. Then, floor(3x) + 1/3 is 7 + 1/3, which is 7.333..., so floor is 7. On the other side, x + 5 = 7/3 + 5 = 7/3 + 15/3 = 22/3 ≈ 7.333..., so floor is 7. Equal again.What about x approaching 8/3 from below, say x = 8/3 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. Then, 3x = 8 - 3ε, so floor(3x) = 7. Then, floor(3x) + 1/3 is 7.333..., so floor is 7. On the other side, x + 5 = 8/3 - ε + 5 = 23/3 - ε ≈ 7.666... - ε, so floor is 7. Still equal.If x is exactly 8/3, then 3x = 8, so floor(3x) = 8. Then, floor(3x) + 1/3 is 8.333..., so floor is 8. On the other side, x + 5 = 8/3 + 5 = 23/3 ≈ 7.666..., so floor is 7. So, 8 ≠ 7, so x = 8/3 is not included, which is consistent with our interval being [7/3, 8/3).Wait, but hold on, when x approaches 8/3 from below, x + 5 approaches 23/3 from below, which is approximately 7.666... So, floor(x + 5) is still 7. But when x is exactly 8/3, x + 5 is exactly 23/3, which is 7.666..., but floor(23/3) is 7 because 23/3 is approximately 7.666..., so floor is 7. Wait, no, 23/3 is 7 and 2/3, so floor is 7. So, actually, even at x = 8/3, floor(x + 5) is 7, but floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) is floor(8 + 1/3) = floor(8.333...) = 8. So, 8 ≠ 7, hence x = 8/3 is excluded.So, our interval [7/3, 8/3) is correct.Is there any other interval where this could hold? Let me think about m = 2, but x in [7/3, 8/3). What if m is higher? Say m = 3, but as we saw earlier, floor(3x) would be at least 9, which is higher than m + 5 = 8, so no solution there.Similarly, for m = 1, floor(3x) would be at most 5, which is less than m + 5 = 6, so no solution.Therefore, the only solution is x in [7/3, 8/3). Converting 7/3 and 8/3 to mixed numbers, 7/3 is 2 and 1/3, and 8/3 is 2 and 2/3. So, x is between 2 and 1/3 and 2 and 2/3.Wait, but 7/3 is approximately 2.333..., and 8/3 is approximately 2.666..., so x is in that interval.Let me just make sure I didn't miss any other cases. The original equation was floor(floor(3x) + 1/3) = floor(x + 5). We simplified it to floor(3x) = floor(x) + 5, which led us to the cases based on m = floor(x). We considered m = 2 and found the interval. For other m's, either the resulting m was not integer or the equation didn't hold.So, I think that's the only solution. Therefore, the solution set is x in [7/3, 8/3).**Final Answer**The solution is all real numbers x in the interval from 7/3 to 8/3, which can be written as boxed{left[ dfrac{7}{3}, dfrac{8}{3} right)}."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function z(a,e,h,d,o,n){const u=b("PoemCard");return i(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(i(!0),s(y,null,w(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(i(),s("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),s("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const D=m(L,[["render",z],["__scopeId","data-v-eb25e3fa"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/67.md","filePath":"library/67.md"}'),O={name:"library/67.md"},j=Object.assign(O,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),s("div",null,[k(D)]))}});export{H as __pageData,j as default};
