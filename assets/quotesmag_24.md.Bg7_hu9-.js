A height (BH) is drawn in it. A point (P) is chosen on side (CA) such that (AP = AB), and a point (Q) is chosen on side (CB) such that (BQ = BH). Prove that lines (PQ) and (AB) are parallel.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out how to prove that lines PQ and AB are parallel in this specific triangle setup. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem says that triangle ABC is such that AB equals BC, and angle ABC is 90 degrees. So, triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle with AB = BC and the right angle at B. That means sides AB and BC are equal, and the hypotenuse AC must be longer. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem if needed.Next, a height BH is drawn in the triangle. In a right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse has some special properties. I remember that in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse creates two smaller triangles that are similar to each other and to the original triangle. So, triangle ABH is similar to triangle CBH, and both are similar to triangle ABC.Now, point P is chosen on side CA such that AP equals AB. Since AB is one of the legs of the triangle, AP is equal in length to AB. That means point P is somewhere on CA such that the segment from A to P is equal to AB. I should probably sketch this to visualize where P is located.Similarly, point Q is chosen on side CB such that BQ equals BH. BH is the altitude from B to AC, so BQ is equal to that length. Since BH is an altitude, it's shorter than BC, so Q is somewhere between B and C on side CB.The goal is to prove that lines PQ and AB are parallel. To show that two lines are parallel, I can use various methods like showing corresponding angles are equal, or using the converse of the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), or showing that the slopes are equal if I use coordinate geometry.Maybe using coordinate geometry would be a good approach here because it allows me to assign coordinates to each point and calculate the necessary slopes or vectors to show parallelism.Let's assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0) since it's the right angle. Since AB = BC, let's assume AB = BC = 1 for simplicity. Then, point A can be at (0,1) and point C can be at (1,0). That way, AB is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,1), BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0), and AC is the hypotenuse from (0,1) to (1,0).Now, let's find the coordinates of point H, the foot of the altitude from B to AC. The equation of AC can be found since it goes from (0,1) to (1,0). The slope of AC is (0-1)/(1-0) = -1, so the equation is y = -x + 1. The altitude from B to AC is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -1, which is 1. Since it passes through B(0,0), the equation is y = x.To find point H, we solve the system of equations y = -x + 1 and y = x. Setting them equal: x = -x + 1 => 2x = 1 => x = 1/2. Then y = 1/2. So, H is at (1/2, 1/2).Next, point P is on CA such that AP = AB. AB is 1 unit, so AP should also be 1 unit. Let's find the coordinates of P. Since A is at (0,1) and C is at (1,0), the length of AC is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So, AP is 1, which is less than sqrt(2), so P is somewhere between A and C.To find P, we can parametrize AC. Let me use a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A(0,1), and t=1, we are at C(1,0). So, the parametric equations are x = t, y = 1 - t. The distance from A to a general point (t, 1 - t) is sqrt((t - 0)^2 + ((1 - t) - 1)^2) = sqrt(t^2 + t^2) = sqrt(2t^2) = t*sqrt(2). We want this distance to be 1, so t*sqrt(2) = 1 => t = 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the coordinates of P are (1/sqrt(2), 1 - 1/sqrt(2)).Similarly, point Q is on CB such that BQ = BH. BH is the length from B(0,0) to H(1/2,1/2), which is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2). So, BQ should be 1/sqrt(2). Since CB is from (0,0) to (1,0), it's along the x-axis. So, moving from B(0,0) towards C(1,0), a distance of 1/sqrt(2) along the x-axis would place Q at (1/sqrt(2), 0).Now, we have coordinates for P and Q. Let me write them down:- P: (1/sqrt(2), 1 - 1/sqrt(2))- Q: (1/sqrt(2), 0)Now, let's find the slope of PQ. The slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Plugging in the coordinates:Slope of PQ = (0 - (1 - 1/sqrt(2))) / (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) = (-1 + 1/sqrt(2)) / 0.Wait, that's undefined. That would mean PQ is a vertical line. But AB is from (0,0) to (0,1), which is also a vertical line. So, if both PQ and AB are vertical, they are parallel.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because dividing by zero suggests that the x-coordinates are the same, which they are for both P and Q. So, PQ is indeed a vertical line, same as AB, hence they are parallel.Alternatively, if I consider vectors, the vector PQ is (0, - (1 - 1/sqrt(2))), and the vector AB is (0,1). Both vectors are vertical, so they are scalar multiples of each other, confirming that PQ is parallel to AB.Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me think if there's another way to approach this without coordinate geometry, maybe using similar triangles or properties of the isosceles right triangle.Since ABC is an isosceles right triangle, and BH is the altitude, which we know splits the triangle into two smaller isosceles right triangles, ABH and CBH. So, both ABH and CBH are similar to ABC.Point P is on AC such that AP = AB. Since AB = 1, AP = 1, and AC = sqrt(2), so P divides AC in the ratio AP:PC = 1 : (sqrt(2) - 1). Similarly, Q is on CB such that BQ = BH = 1/sqrt(2). Since CB = 1, BQ = 1/sqrt(2), so QC = 1 - 1/sqrt(2).If I can show that the triangles APB and QPB are similar or something like that, but I'm not sure. Maybe using the basic proportionality theorem, which states that if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.Wait, in triangle ABC, if I can show that PQ divides sides AB and BC proportionally, then PQ would be parallel to AC. But in this case, we need to show PQ is parallel to AB, not AC. Maybe I need to consider another triangle.Alternatively, since both PQ and AB are vertical lines in my coordinate system, they are parallel by definition. But maybe in a different coordinate system, this wouldn't hold, but since the triangle is fixed, the conclusion should be general.I think the coordinate approach was the most straightforward here, showing that both PQ and AB are vertical lines, hence parallel. Alternatively, using vectors or slopes also confirms this.Another way is to consider transformations. Since AP = AB and BQ = BH, and given the symmetry of the isosceles right triangle, the points P and Q are constructed in such a way that PQ ends up being a translated version of AB, hence parallel.But perhaps the simplest explanation is the coordinate method, which clearly shows both lines are vertical, thus parallel.So, after going through this, I feel confident that PQ is indeed parallel to AB."},{"question":"Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris. Kris has one fourth the turtles Kristen has. How many turtles are there altogether if Kristen has a certain number of turtles and the total is 30?","answer":"First, I'll define the number of turtles Kristen has as ( K ).Kris has one fourth of Kristen's turtles, so Kris has ( frac{K}{4} ) turtles.Trey has five times as many turtles as Kris, which means Trey has ( 5 times frac{K}{4} = frac{5K}{4} ) turtles.The total number of turtles is the sum of Kristen's, Kris's, and Trey's turtles:[K + frac{K}{4} + frac{5K}{4} = 30]Combining the terms:[K + frac{K}{4} + frac{5K}{4} = K + frac{6K}{4} = K + frac{3K}{2} = frac{5K}{2}]Setting this equal to 30:[frac{5K}{2} = 30]Solving for ( K ):[5K = 60 K = 12]So, Kristen has 12 turtles. Kris has ( frac{12}{4} = 3 ) turtles, and Trey has ( frac{5 times 12}{4} = 15 ) turtles.Adding them up:[12 + 3 + 15 = 30]Thus, the total number of turtles is 30."},{"question":"Nadia walked some distance, which was twice as far as Hannah walked. The two girls walked a total of 27 kilometers. How many kilometers did Nadia walk?","answer":"First, I need to determine how far Hannah walked. Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as ( x ) kilometers.According to the problem, Nadia walked twice as far as Hannah, so Nadia walked ( 2x ) kilometers.The total distance walked by both girls is 27 kilometers. Therefore, I can set up the equation:[ x + 2x = 27 ]Combining like terms, the equation becomes:[ 3x = 27 ]To find the value of ( x ), I divide both sides of the equation by 3:[ x = frac{27}{3} ][ x = 9 ]So, Hannah walked 9 kilometers. Since Nadia walked twice as far as Hannah, I multiply Hannah's distance by 2 to find Nadia's distance:[ 2 times 9 = 18 ]Therefore, Nadia walked 18 kilometers."},{"question":"Given a right-angled triangle ABC with a perimeter of 14 and an area of 7. Find the lengths of its three sides.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a right-angled triangle ABC. The perimeter is 14, and the area is 7. I need to find the lengths of its three sides. Hmm, right-angled triangle, so I know one of the angles is 90 degrees, and the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me denote the sides. Let's say the two legs are 'a' and 'b', and the hypotenuse is 'c'. So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, I have:a² + b² = c²  ...(1)That's one equation. Now, the perimeter is 14, so the sum of all sides is 14:a + b + c = 14  ...(2)And the area is 7. Since it's a right-angled triangle, the area is (1/2)*base*height, which in this case would be (1/2)*a*b:(1/2)*a*b = 7  ...(3)So, I have three equations here. I need to solve for a, b, and c. Let me see how I can manipulate these equations to find the values.Starting with equation (3), I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:a*b = 14  ...(3a)So, the product of a and b is 14. That's useful.Now, looking at equation (2), a + b + c = 14. Maybe I can express c in terms of a and b. Let's rearrange equation (2):c = 14 - a - b  ...(2a)So, c is 14 minus the sum of a and b. That makes sense because the perimeter is fixed.Now, let's plug this expression for c into equation (1). So, equation (1) becomes:a² + b² = (14 - a - b)²Let me expand the right-hand side:(14 - a - b)² = 14² - 2*14*(a + b) + (a + b)²= 196 - 28(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²So, substituting back into equation (1):a² + b² = 196 - 28(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²Hmm, let's subtract a² + b² from both sides to simplify:0 = 196 - 28(a + b) + 2abSo, 2ab - 28(a + b) + 196 = 0I can divide the entire equation by 2 to make it simpler:ab - 14(a + b) + 98 = 0  ...(4)Now, from equation (3a), I know that ab = 14. Let me substitute that into equation (4):14 - 14(a + b) + 98 = 0Simplify:14 + 98 - 14(a + b) = 0112 - 14(a + b) = 0So, 14(a + b) = 112Divide both sides by 14:a + b = 8  ...(5)Alright, so now I know that a + b = 8 and ab = 14. This looks like a system of equations that I can solve using quadratic equations.Let me consider a and b as the roots of a quadratic equation. If I let x be a variable, then the quadratic equation would be:x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0Substituting the known values:x² - 8x + 14 = 0Now, I can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:x = [8 ± √(64 - 56)] / 2= [8 ± √8] / 2= [8 ± 2√2] / 2= 4 ± √2So, the two roots are 4 + √2 and 4 - √2. Therefore, the lengths of the two legs are 4 + √2 and 4 - √2.Now, let's find the hypotenuse c. From equation (2a):c = 14 - a - b= 14 - (a + b)= 14 - 8= 6So, the hypotenuse is 6.Let me just verify if these values satisfy all the original equations.First, check the Pythagorean theorem:a² + b² = (4 + √2)² + (4 - √2)²= (16 + 8√2 + 2) + (16 - 8√2 + 2)= 18 + 18= 36And c² = 6² = 36. So, that checks out.Next, check the perimeter:a + b + c = (4 + √2) + (4 - √2) + 6= 4 + √2 + 4 - √2 + 6= 4 + 4 + 6 + √2 - √2= 14That's correct.Finally, check the area:(1/2)*a*b = (1/2)*(4 + √2)*(4 - √2)= (1/2)*(16 - (√2)²)= (1/2)*(16 - 2)= (1/2)*14= 7Perfect, that matches the given area.So, all the conditions are satisfied with the sides being 4 - √2, 4 + √2, and 6."},{"question":"If two different square roots of a positive number are 2m-6 and m+3, then m is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If two different square roots of a positive number are (2m - 6) and (m + 3), then (m) is ____.Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I know that every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative. For example, the square roots of 9 are 3 and -3. So, in this problem, (2m - 6) and (m + 3) must be these two square roots of the same positive number.Since they are square roots of the same number, they must satisfy the property that one is the negative of the other. That is, if one square root is (a), the other should be (-a). So, I can set up an equation where one expression is equal to the negative of the other.Let me write that down:[2m - 6 = -(m + 3)]Hmm, okay. So, I have (2m - 6) equals the negative of (m + 3). Let me solve this equation for (m).First, I'll distribute the negative sign on the right side:[2m - 6 = -m - 3]Now, I want to get all the (m) terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me add (m) to both sides to get rid of the (-m) on the right:[2m + m - 6 = -3]Simplifying the left side:[3m - 6 = -3]Next, I'll add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with (m):[3m = 3]Now, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for (m):[m = 1]Wait, so (m) is 1? Let me check if this makes sense. If (m = 1), then let's compute both square roots:First square root: (2m - 6 = 2(1) - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4)Second square root: (m + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4)Okay, so the two square roots are -4 and 4, which are indeed negatives of each other. That means they are the two square roots of the same positive number, which is 16 because ((-4)^2 = 16) and (4^2 = 16).Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the equation:[2m - 6 = -(m + 3)]Expanding the right side:[2m - 6 = -m - 3]Adding (m) to both sides:[3m - 6 = -3]Adding 6 to both sides:[3m = 3]Dividing by 3:[m = 1]Yep, that all checks out. So, (m = 1) is the correct answer. I think I've got it!"},{"question":"Use the bisection method to find the real root of the equation (x^{3}-2x-5=0) in the interval ([2,3]).

They've given me that the midpoint of the interval is (x_0 = 2.5), and I need to figure out which of the next intervals contains the root. The options are A: ([2, 2.5]), B: ([2.5, 3]), C: (left[ frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}right]), and D: None of the above.Alright, let me start by recalling what the bisection method is. From what I remember, the bisection method is a numerical method used to find roots of a continuous function. It works by repeatedly narrowing down an interval where the function changes sign, meaning it goes from positive to negative or vice versa. The idea is that if a function changes sign over an interval, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root in that interval.So, the steps are roughly: 1) Check the function values at the endpoints of the interval. 2) If the function changes sign, then the root is in that interval. 3) Find the midpoint of the interval and evaluate the function there. 4) Determine which half of the interval the root lies in by checking the sign change. 5) Repeat the process on the new interval.Alright, let's apply this to the given equation (f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5). The initial interval is ([2, 3]). I need to compute (f(2)) and (f(3)) to see if the function changes sign in this interval.Calculating (f(2)):(f(2) = 2^3 - 2*2 - 5 = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1). So, (f(2) = -1), which is negative.Calculating (f(3)):(f(3) = 3^3 - 2*3 - 5 = 27 - 6 - 5 = 16). So, (f(3) = 16), which is positive.Since (f(2)) is negative and (f(3)) is positive, the function changes sign between 2 and 3, so there must be a root in this interval. Good, that's consistent with the problem statement.Now, they've given the midpoint (x_0 = 2.5). Let me compute (f(2.5)) to see where the function is at this midpoint.Calculating (f(2.5)):First, (2.5^3) is (2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5). Let me compute that step by step:- (2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25)- (6.25 * 2.5 = 15.625)So, (2.5^3 = 15.625)Then, (2x) when (x = 2.5) is (2 * 2.5 = 5)So, (f(2.5) = 15.625 - 5 - 5 = 15.625 - 10 = 5.625). So, (f(2.5) = 5.625), which is positive.Wait, so (f(2) = -1) is negative, (f(2.5) = 5.625) is positive. That means the function changed sign between 2 and 2.5, right? So, the root must lie in the interval ([2, 2.5]).But hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The bisection method says that if (f(a)) and (f(c)) have opposite signs, then the root is in ([a, c]), otherwise, it's in ([c, b]). So, in this case, (a = 2), (b = 3), and (c = 2.5).Since (f(a) = -1) is negative and (f(c) = 5.625) is positive, they have opposite signs. Therefore, the root lies in ([2, 2.5]). So, the next interval should be ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But wait, let me check the options again. Option C is (left[ frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}right]). Let me compute what that is in decimal to see if it's the same as ([2, 2.5]).(frac{5}{2} = 2.5) and (frac{11}{4} = 2.75). So, option C is ([2.5, 2.75]). That's different from option A, which is ([2, 2.5]). So, why is option C there?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the midpoint. Let me double-check the midpoint calculation. The midpoint of ([2, 3]) is indeed (2.5), so that's correct. Then, evaluating (f(2.5)) gave me a positive value, so the root is between 2 and 2.5, which is option A.But let me make sure that I didn't miscalculate (f(2.5)). Maybe I did that wrong.Calculating (f(2.5)) again:(2.5^3 = 15.625)(2x = 5)So, (f(2.5) = 15.625 - 5 - 5 = 5.625). Yes, that's correct.So, (f(2.5)) is positive, so the root is in ([2, 2.5]). So, the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But wait, why is option C there? Let me think. Maybe the question is asking for the next interval after taking the midpoint, but perhaps they are considering further subdivisions?Wait, no. The bisection method is about taking the midpoint and then deciding which half to keep. So, in the first step, we have ([2, 3]), midpoint at 2.5, evaluate (f(2.5)), which is positive, so since (f(2)) is negative, the root is in ([2, 2.5]). So, the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But let me check the options again. Option C is (left[ frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}right]), which is ([2.5, 2.75]). That seems like the next midpoint if we were to continue bisecting, but in this case, we're only asked for the next interval after the first midpoint.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says: \\"Taking the midpoint of the interval (x_0 = 2.5), the next interval containing the root is (　　).\\" So, after taking the midpoint, we determine which half to keep. Since (f(2.5)) is positive and (f(2)) is negative, the root is in ([2, 2.5]), so the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the question is considering that the midpoint is 2.5, and the next interval is from 2.5 to the next midpoint? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The bisection method is about halving the interval each time, so after the first midpoint, we keep the half where the function changes sign.So, in this case, since (f(2)) is negative and (f(2.5)) is positive, the function changes sign between 2 and 2.5, so the root is in ([2, 2.5]). Therefore, the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But wait, let me check if the function actually has a root in ([2, 2.5]). Maybe I should graph it or compute more points to be sure. Let me compute (f(2.25)) to see.Calculating (f(2.25)):(2.25^3 = 2.25 * 2.25 * 2.25)First, (2.25 * 2.25 = 5.0625)Then, (5.0625 * 2.25 = 11.390625)So, (2.25^3 = 11.390625)Then, (2x = 4.5)So, (f(2.25) = 11.390625 - 4.5 - 5 = 11.390625 - 9.5 = 1.890625), which is positive.So, (f(2.25)) is positive. Since (f(2) = -1) is negative and (f(2.25)) is positive, the root is between 2 and 2.25. So, that's within ([2, 2.5]), so yes, the interval ([2, 2.5]) is correct.Wait, but if I compute (f(2.125)), let's see:(2.125^3 = 2.125 * 2.125 * 2.125)First, (2.125 * 2.125 = 4.515625)Then, (4.515625 * 2.125 ≈ 9.61328125)So, (f(2.125) = 9.61328125 - 4.25 - 5 = 9.61328125 - 9.25 ≈ 0.36328125), which is still positive.So, (f(2.125)) is positive. So, the root is between 2 and 2.125. So, that's still within ([2, 2.5]).Wait, but if I compute (f(2.0625)):(2.0625^3 ≈ 2.0625 * 2.0625 * 2.0625)First, (2.0625 * 2.0625 ≈ 4.251953125)Then, (4.251953125 * 2.0625 ≈ 8.7890625)So, (f(2.0625) ≈ 8.7890625 - 4.125 - 5 ≈ 8.7890625 - 9.125 ≈ -0.3359375), which is negative.Ah, so (f(2.0625)) is negative. So, the function changes sign between 2.0625 and 2.125. So, the root is in ([2.0625, 2.125]). But that's getting into more detailed subdivisions. However, in the context of the bisection method, after the first midpoint, we only need to determine the next interval, which is ([2, 2.5]), as we found earlier.So, going back, the question is asking for the next interval after taking the midpoint (x_0 = 2.5). Since (f(2.5)) is positive and (f(2)) is negative, the root is in ([2, 2.5]), so the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But wait, let me check the options again. Option C is (left[ frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}right]), which is ([2.5, 2.75]). That seems like the next interval if we were to take the midpoint of ([2.5, 3]), but in this case, since the root is in ([2, 2.5]), we don't need to consider ([2.5, 3]) anymore.Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \\"Taking the midpoint of the interval (x_0 = 2.5), the next interval containing the root is (　　).\\" So, after taking the midpoint, we have two intervals: ([2, 2.5]) and ([2.5, 3]). We evaluate (f(2.5)) and find it's positive, so since (f(2)) is negative, the root is in ([2, 2.5]). Therefore, the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But let me make sure that I'm not confusing the next interval with the next midpoint. The next interval is simply the half where the function changes sign, which is ([2, 2.5]). So, the answer should be A.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the question is considering that after taking the midpoint, the next interval is the one that includes the midpoint and the next point? No, that doesn't make sense. The bisection method is about halving the interval each time, so after the first midpoint, we keep the half where the function changes sign.So, in this case, since (f(2)) is negative and (f(2.5)) is positive, the root is in ([2, 2.5]), so the next interval is ([2, 2.5]), which is option A.But wait, let me check if the function actually has a root in ([2, 2.5]). I've already computed (f(2.5) = 5.625) and (f(2) = -1), so yes, the function changes sign there. Therefore, the root is indeed in ([2, 2.5]).So, the correct answer should be A.Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is (left[ frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}right]), which is ([2.5, 2.75]). That's the interval from 2.5 to 2.75, which is the right half of the original interval. But since the function at 2.5 is positive and at 3 is positive, the function doesn't change sign in ([2.5, 3]), so the root isn't there. Therefore, option C is incorrect.So, the correct answer is A: ([2, 2.5]).Wait, but let me think about the initial function. (f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5). Let me see if I can find an approximate root to confirm.Using the Newton-Raphson method for a quick approximation, starting with (x_0 = 2):(f(2) = -1)(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2)(f'(2) = 12 - 2 = 10)Next approximation: (x_1 = 2 - (-1)/10 = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1)Compute (f(2.1)):(2.1^3 = 9.261)(2*2.1 = 4.2)(f(2.1) = 9.261 - 4.2 - 5 = 0.061), which is very close to zero.So, the root is approximately 2.1, which is within ([2, 2.5]). Therefore, the interval containing the root is indeed ([2, 2.5]), so option A is correct.But wait, let me check if the function actually crosses zero between 2 and 2.5. Since (f(2) = -1) and (f(2.5) = 5.625), and the function is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root in ([2, 2.5]). So, that confirms it.Therefore, the correct answer is A: ([2, 2.5])."},{"question":"The vectors mathbf{a}, mathbf{b}, and mathbf{d} satisfy |mathbf{a}| = |mathbf{b}| = 1, |mathbf{d}| = 3, and[mathbf{a} times (mathbf{a} times mathbf{d}) + 2mathbf{b} = mathbf{0}.]If phi is the angle between mathbf{a} and mathbf{d}, then find all possible values of phi, in degrees.","answer":"Alright, so I have this vector problem here, and I need to find the possible angles between vectors a and d. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.First, the problem states that vectors a, b, and d satisfy certain conditions. The magnitudes of a and b are both 1, and the magnitude of d is 3. There's also this vector equation given:a × (a × d) + 2b = 0I remember that when dealing with cross products, especially triple cross products, there's a useful identity that can simplify things. The identity is:a × (b × c) = b(a · c) - c(a · b)So, applying this identity to the term a × (a × d), I can rewrite it as:a × (a × d) = a(a · d) - d(a · a)Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Yes, it's the same as the identity, where the first vector is a, the second is a, and the third is d. So, substituting, it becomes:a × (a × d) = a(a · d) - d(a · a)Now, since a · a is just the magnitude of a squared, which is 1 because ||a|| = 1. So, that simplifies to:a × (a × d) = a(a · d) - dSo, plugging this back into the original equation:a(a · d) - d + 2b = 0Let me rearrange this equation to solve for d:a(a · d) - d + 2b = 0  => a(a · d) + 2b = dSo, d is expressed in terms of a, b, and the dot product of a and d. Let's denote the dot product (a · d) as k for simplicity. So, k = a · d.Then, the equation becomes:d = k a + 2bNow, since d is expressed as a linear combination of a and b, and we know the magnitudes of a, b, and d, we can use the magnitude condition to find k.First, let's compute the magnitude of d:||d|| = 3But d = k a + 2b, so:||d|| = ||k a + 2b|| = 3To find the magnitude of this vector, we can use the formula for the magnitude of a vector expressed as a linear combination of two orthogonal vectors. Since a and b are unit vectors, but are they orthogonal? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that a and b are orthogonal. Hmm, that might complicate things.Wait, let me check. The problem says ||a|| = ||b|| = 1, but it doesn't say anything about their dot product. So, a and b might not necessarily be orthogonal. Hmm, that complicates things because if a and b are not orthogonal, then the magnitude of d would involve the dot product of a and b.But wait, in the equation d = k a + 2b, if a and b are not orthogonal, then the magnitude squared of d would be:||d||² = (k a + 2b) · (k a + 2b) = k² ||a||² + 4 ||b||² + 4k (a · b)Since ||a|| = ||b|| = 1, this simplifies to:||d||² = k² + 4 + 4k (a · b)But we know that ||d|| = 3, so:k² + 4 + 4k (a · b) = 9  => k² + 4k (a · b) + 4 - 9 = 0  => k² + 4k (a · b) - 5 = 0Hmm, so we have this quadratic equation in terms of k, but we have two unknowns here: k and (a · b). That seems tricky because we have only one equation but two variables. Maybe there's another condition we can use.Wait, let's go back to the original equation:a × (a × d) + 2b = 0  => a × (a × d) = -2bBut from earlier, we have:a × (a × d) = a(a · d) - d = k a - dSo, setting that equal to -2b:k a - d = -2b  => d = k a + 2bWhich is consistent with what we had before. So, maybe we need another approach.Alternatively, perhaps we can take the dot product of both sides of the equation d = k a + 2b with a. Let's try that.Taking the dot product with a:d · a = (k a + 2b) · a  => k = k (a · a) + 2 (b · a)  => k = k (1) + 2 (a · b)  => k = k + 2 (a · b)Subtracting k from both sides:0 = 2 (a · b)  => a · b = 0Oh, interesting! So, a and b are orthogonal. That simplifies things a lot.So, now we know that a · b = 0, which means a and b are perpendicular. Therefore, in the expression for ||d||², the cross term involving a · b will be zero. So, going back to the magnitude equation:||d||² = k² + 4 + 4k (a · b)  But since a · b = 0, this simplifies to:||d||² = k² + 4  => 9 = k² + 4  => k² = 5  => k = ±√5So, k = a · d = ±√5But wait, the dot product a · d is equal to ||a|| ||d|| cos φ, where φ is the angle between a and d. Since ||a|| = 1 and ||d|| = 3, we have:a · d = 1 * 3 * cos φ = 3 cos φBut we found that a · d = k = ±√5, so:3 cos φ = ±√5  => cos φ = ±√5 / 3Therefore, the possible angles φ are the arccosines of √5/3 and -√5/3.So, φ = arccos(√5/3) or φ = arccos(-√5/3)But let me make sure this makes sense. Since the cosine function is even, arccos(-x) = 180° - arccos(x). So, these two angles are supplementary.Therefore, the possible angles between a and d are arccos(√5/3) and 180° - arccos(√5/3).But the problem asks for all possible values of φ in degrees. So, I need to compute these angles numerically or leave them in terms of arccos?Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether to leave it in terms of arccos or compute the numerical value. Since it's asking for degrees, maybe I should compute the numerical value.Let me compute arccos(√5/3). First, √5 is approximately 2.236, so √5/3 is approximately 0.745.Now, arccos(0.745) is approximately... Let me recall that cos(40°) ≈ 0.766, cos(45°) ≈ 0.707. So, 0.745 is between 40° and 45°. Let me use a calculator for a better approximation.Using a calculator, arccos(0.745) ≈ 41.81°. Similarly, arccos(-0.745) would be 180° - 41.81° ≈ 138.19°.So, the possible angles are approximately 41.81° and 138.19°. But since the problem might expect an exact expression, perhaps in terms of inverse cosine, I should present both possibilities.Alternatively, since the problem might accept the answer in terms of arccos, I can write:φ = arccos(√5/3) or φ = π - arccos(√5/3)But since the question asks for degrees, I should convert the radians to degrees if necessary. However, arccos(√5/3) is already an angle measure, so expressing it in degrees is fine.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's already given in degrees, so I think it's acceptable to leave it as arccos(√5/3) and its supplementary angle.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Applied the vector triple product identity correctly: a × (a × d) = a(a · d) - d(a · a) = a(a · d) - d, since ||a|| = 1.2. Substituted into the equation: a(a · d) - d + 2b = 0 => d = a(a · d) + 2b.3. Took the dot product with a: d · a = (a · d) + 2(b · a) => k = k + 2(a · b) => 0 = 2(a · b) => a · b = 0.4. Therefore, a and b are orthogonal, so ||d||² = k² + 4 = 9 => k² = 5 => k = ±√5.5. Then, since a · d = 3 cos φ = ±√5 => cos φ = ±√5/3.6. Therefore, φ = arccos(√5/3) or φ = arccos(-√5/3) = 180° - arccos(√5/3).Yes, that seems correct. So, the possible angles are arccos(√5/3) and its supplementary angle.But just to make sure, let me compute arccos(√5/3) numerically.√5 ≈ 2.236, so √5/3 ≈ 0.745.Using a calculator, arccos(0.745) ≈ 41.81°, so the other angle is 180° - 41.81° ≈ 138.19°.So, the possible angles are approximately 41.81° and 138.19°. But since the problem doesn't specify whether to approximate or not, I think it's safer to present the exact expressions.Therefore, the possible values of φ are arccos(√5/3) and arccos(-√5/3), which correspond to approximately 41.81° and 138.19°.Wait, but the problem says \\"find all possible values of φ, in degrees.\\" So, maybe I should present both angles in degrees, either as exact expressions or approximate values.Given that, I think it's appropriate to write both angles in degrees, either as arccos expressions or their approximate degree measures.But since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps in terms of inverse cosine, I should present both possibilities.Alternatively, since the problem might accept the answer in terms of arccos, I can write:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = 180° - arccos(√5/3)But to make it clear, I can write both angles explicitly.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for all possible values of φ, so both angles are valid solutions.So, in conclusion, the possible angles are arccos(√5/3) and 180° - arccos(√5/3), which are approximately 41.81° and 138.19°.But since the problem asks for the answer in degrees, I think it's acceptable to present both angles in degrees, either as exact expressions or approximate values.However, since the exact value is more precise, I think it's better to present the exact expressions.Therefore, the possible values of φ are arccos(√5/3) and arccos(-√5/3), which correspond to angles of approximately 41.81° and 138.19°, respectively.But to present the answer neatly, I can write:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = 180° - arccos(√5/3)Alternatively, since arccos(-x) = 180° - arccos(x), I can write both solutions as:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = π - arccos(√5/3) in radians, but since the question asks for degrees, I should stick to degrees.Therefore, the final answer is that φ can be arccos(√5/3) degrees or 180° minus arccos(√5/3) degrees.But to make it more precise, I can write:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = 180° - arccos(√5/3)But perhaps the problem expects the numerical values. Let me check.If I compute arccos(√5/3):√5 ≈ 2.236, so √5/3 ≈ 0.745.Using a calculator, arccos(0.745) ≈ 41.81°, so the other angle is 180° - 41.81° ≈ 138.19°.So, the possible angles are approximately 41.81° and 138.19°.But since the problem might prefer exact expressions, I think it's better to present both angles in terms of arccos.Therefore, the possible values of φ are arccos(√5/3) and 180° - arccos(√5/3).But to write it more neatly, I can express both solutions as:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = 180° - arccos(√5/3)Alternatively, since arccos(-√5/3) = 180° - arccos(√5/3), I can write:φ = arccos(√5/3) and φ = arccos(-√5/3)But both expressions are equivalent.In conclusion, the possible angles between vectors a and d are arccos(√5/3) and arccos(-√5/3), which are approximately 41.81° and 138.19°, respectively."},{"question":"Let the function f(x) be a differentiable function defined on (-infty, 0), with its derivative denoted as f'(x), and it satisfies 3f(x) + xf'(x) > 0.

It says that 3f(x) + xf'(x) > 0. Then, I need to solve the inequality (x + 2015)^3 f(x + 2015) + 27f(-3) > 0. The options are given as intervals, so I need to figure out which interval satisfies this inequality.First, I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving functions and their derivatives, sometimes it's helpful to construct a new function that incorporates both f(x) and its derivative. The given condition is 3f(x) + xf'(x) > 0. Hmm, that looks like it could be related to the derivative of some product or composite function.Let me think about it. If I have a function g(x) that is a product of x^k and f(x), maybe its derivative would involve terms like f(x) and xf'(x). Let me try that. Let’s define g(x) = x^3 f(x). Then, what is the derivative of g(x)?Using the product rule: g'(x) = d/dx [x^3 f(x)] = 3x^2 f(x) + x^3 f'(x). Hmm, that's 3x^2 f(x) + x^3 f'(x). If I factor out x^2, I get x^2 (3f(x) + x f'(x)). Oh! That's exactly the expression given in the problem, 3f(x) + x f'(x), multiplied by x^2.Since x is in (-∞, 0), x^2 is always positive, right? So, x^2 > 0 for all x ≠ 0. Therefore, g'(x) = x^2 (3f(x) + x f'(x)) > 0 because both x^2 and (3f(x) + x f'(x)) are positive. So, g'(x) > 0, which means that g(x) is monotonically increasing on (-∞, 0).Okay, so g(x) is increasing. That's a useful property. Now, let's look back at the inequality we need to solve: (x + 2015)^3 f(x + 2015) + 27f(-3) > 0.Wait a second, (x + 2015)^3 f(x + 2015) is exactly g(x + 2015), since g(x) = x^3 f(x). So, substituting, the inequality becomes g(x + 2015) + 27f(-3) > 0.Let me write that down: g(x + 2015) + 27f(-3) > 0.Hmm, I can rearrange this inequality to g(x + 2015) > -27f(-3). Let me think about what -27f(-3) is. Since g(x) = x^3 f(x), then g(-3) = (-3)^3 f(-3) = -27f(-3). So, -27f(-3) is equal to g(-3). Therefore, the inequality becomes g(x + 2015) > g(-3).So, now I have g(x + 2015) > g(-3). Since g is monotonically increasing, this inequality implies that x + 2015 > -3, right? Because if a function is increasing, then if a > b, g(a) > g(b). So, in this case, since g(x + 2015) > g(-3), it must be that x + 2015 > -3.But wait, hold on. The function g is defined on (-∞, 0). So, x + 2015 must also be in (-∞, 0). Therefore, x + 2015 < 0. So, combining these two inequalities:x + 2015 > -3 and x + 2015 < 0.Let me solve these inequalities for x.First inequality: x + 2015 > -3. Subtract 2015 from both sides: x > -3 - 2015, which is x > -2018.Second inequality: x + 2015 < 0. Subtract 2015: x < -2015.So, combining these, x must be greater than -2018 and less than -2015. Therefore, the solution set is (-2018, -2015).Looking back at the options, option A is (-2018, -2015), which matches my solution. So, I think the correct answer is A.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. Defined g(x) = x^3 f(x).2. Calculated g'(x) = x^2 (3f(x) + x f'(x)) > 0, so g is increasing.3. Rewrote the given inequality in terms of g: g(x + 2015) > g(-3).4. Since g is increasing, x + 2015 > -3 and x + 2015 < 0.5. Solved for x: -2018 < x < -2015.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given that theta is an interior angle of a triangle, overrightarrow{m} = (sintheta, costheta) and overrightarrow{n} = (1, 1), and the dot product overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n} = frac{1}{3}, determine the type of conic section represented by the equation x^2sintheta - y^2costheta = 1, and specify whether its foci lie on the x-axis or y-axis. The options are parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, it says that θ is an interior angle of a triangle. That means θ is between 0 and π radians, right? Because in a triangle, each angle is less than 180 degrees, which is π radians. So θ is somewhere between 0 and π.Next, there are two vectors given: vector m is (sinθ, cosθ) and vector n is (1, 1). The dot product of these two vectors is given as 1/3. I remember that the dot product of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is ac + bd. So applying that here, the dot product of m and n should be sinθ*1 + cosθ*1, which simplifies to sinθ + cosθ. And that equals 1/3. So, sinθ + cosθ = 1/3.Hmm, okay. So I have the equation sinθ + cosθ = 1/3. I need to find θ, but maybe I don't need the exact value. The problem is about determining the type of conic section given by the equation x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1. So maybe I just need to figure out the signs of sinθ and cosθ, or their relative magnitudes.Let me think. Since θ is between 0 and π, sinθ is always positive because sine is positive in the first and second quadrants. Cosθ, on the other hand, is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second quadrant. So depending on where θ is, cosθ could be positive or negative.But given that sinθ + cosθ = 1/3, which is positive, that tells me that cosθ must be positive as well because sinθ is positive, and their sum is positive. If cosθ were negative, sinθ + cosθ could still be positive if sinθ is larger in magnitude, but let's see.Wait, actually, if θ is in the first quadrant, both sinθ and cosθ are positive. If θ is in the second quadrant, sinθ is positive, and cosθ is negative. So, if θ is in the second quadrant, sinθ + cosθ could still be positive or negative depending on the values. But in our case, it's 1/3, which is positive. So, if θ is in the second quadrant, cosθ is negative, so sinθ must be greater than |cosθ| to make the sum positive. If θ is in the first quadrant, both are positive, so their sum is positive.So, θ could be in either the first or second quadrant. But let's see if we can narrow it down. Maybe we can square both sides of the equation sinθ + cosθ = 1/3 to find more information.Let's square both sides: (sinθ + cosθ)² = (1/3)². That gives sin²θ + 2 sinθ cosθ + cos²θ = 1/9. I know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so substituting that in, we get 1 + 2 sinθ cosθ = 1/9. Then, 2 sinθ cosθ = 1/9 - 1 = -8/9. So sinθ cosθ = -4/9.Hmm, interesting. So sinθ cosθ is negative. That tells me that either sinθ is positive and cosθ is negative, or vice versa. But since θ is between 0 and π, sinθ is always positive. Therefore, cosθ must be negative. So θ is in the second quadrant.Okay, so θ is between π/2 and π. That means sinθ is positive and cosθ is negative. So in the equation x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1, sinθ is positive, and cosθ is negative. So let's substitute that in.The equation becomes x²*(positive) - y²*(negative) = 1. Which simplifies to x²*(positive) + y²*(positive) = 1. Wait, that would make it an ellipse, right? Because both terms are positive and equal to 1.But wait, hold on. Let me double-check. If cosθ is negative, then -cosθ is positive. So the equation is x² sinθ + y² |cosθ| = 1. So it's x² over 1/sinθ plus y² over 1/|cosθ| equals 1. That is the standard form of an ellipse, where both denominators are positive.But wait, the original equation is x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1. So if cosθ is negative, then -cosθ is positive, so it's x² sinθ + y² |cosθ| = 1. So yes, it's an ellipse.But hold on, let me think again. If both coefficients are positive, then it's an ellipse. If one is positive and the other is negative, it's a hyperbola. So in this case, since both coefficients are positive, it's an ellipse.But wait, the original equation is x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1. So depending on the signs of sinθ and cosθ, the coefficients can change. Since sinθ is positive and cosθ is negative, then -cosθ is positive. So both coefficients are positive, so it's an ellipse.Now, the question is, where are the foci located? For an ellipse, the foci are located along the major axis. The major axis is the one with the larger denominator in the standard form. So let's write the equation in standard form.The standard form of an ellipse is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, where a and b are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes. So in our case, a² = 1/sinθ and b² = 1/|cosθ|.So, if a² > b², then the major axis is along the x-axis, and the foci are on the x-axis. If b² > a², then the major axis is along the y-axis, and the foci are on the y-axis.So, we need to compare 1/sinθ and 1/|cosθ|. Since sinθ is positive and |cosθ| is positive, we can compare sinθ and |cosθ|. If sinθ > |cosθ|, then 1/sinθ < 1/|cosθ|, so b² > a², meaning the major axis is along the y-axis, and foci are on the y-axis.Alternatively, if sinθ < |cosθ|, then a² > b², and foci are on the x-axis.So, we need to determine whether sinθ is greater than |cosθ| or not.From earlier, we have sinθ + cosθ = 1/3 and sinθ cosθ = -4/9.Let me denote sinθ = s and cosθ = c. So s + c = 1/3 and s*c = -4/9.We can solve for s and c. Let's consider s + c = 1/3 and s*c = -4/9.This is a system of equations. Let's solve for s and c.We can write c = 1/3 - s. Substitute into the second equation:s*(1/3 - s) = -4/9Multiply out:(1/3)s - s² = -4/9Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:3s - 9s² = -4Bring all terms to one side:9s² - 3s - 4 = 0Now, solve this quadratic equation for s:s = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 144)] / 18Wait, discriminant is b² - 4ac = 9 + 144 = 153So s = [3 ± sqrt(153)] / 18Simplify sqrt(153): sqrt(9*17) = 3*sqrt(17)So s = [3 ± 3sqrt(17)] / 18 = [1 ± sqrt(17)] / 6Now, since θ is in the second quadrant, sinθ is positive and cosθ is negative. So s = sinθ is positive, and c = cosθ is negative.So s must be positive. Let's compute the two solutions:First solution: [1 + sqrt(17)] / 6 ≈ [1 + 4.123] / 6 ≈ 5.123 / 6 ≈ 0.8538Second solution: [1 - sqrt(17)] / 6 ≈ [1 - 4.123] / 6 ≈ (-3.123)/6 ≈ -0.5205But s = sinθ must be positive, so we take the first solution: s ≈ 0.8538Then c = 1/3 - s ≈ 1/3 - 0.8538 ≈ 0.3333 - 0.8538 ≈ -0.5205So sinθ ≈ 0.8538 and cosθ ≈ -0.5205So sinθ ≈ 0.8538 and |cosθ| ≈ 0.5205So sinθ > |cosθ| because 0.8538 > 0.5205Therefore, in the equation x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1, which is x²*(0.8538) + y²*(0.5205) = 1, the coefficients are both positive, but sinθ > |cosθ|, meaning that the term with x² has a larger coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient for x² is sinθ ≈ 0.8538 and the coefficient for y² is |cosθ| ≈ 0.5205. So sinθ > |cosθ|, so 1/sinθ < 1/|cosθ|, meaning that a² = 1/sinθ ≈ 1.171 and b² = 1/|cosθ| ≈ 1.921. So b² > a², meaning that the major axis is along the y-axis.Therefore, the ellipse has its major axis along the y-axis, so the foci are on the y-axis.Wait, but let me think again. The standard form is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1. If a² < b², then the major axis is along the y-axis, and the foci are located at (0, ±c), where c = sqrt(b² - a²). So yes, foci are on the y-axis.So, putting it all together, the equation x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1 represents an ellipse with foci on the y-axis.I think that's the conclusion. Let me just recap:1. Given θ is an interior angle of a triangle, so 0 < θ < π.2. Vectors m = (sinθ, cosθ) and n = (1,1) have a dot product of 1/3, leading to sinθ + cosθ = 1/3.3. Squaring both sides gives sin²θ + 2 sinθ cosθ + cos²θ = 1/9, which simplifies to 1 + 2 sinθ cosθ = 1/9, so sinθ cosθ = -4/9.4. Since sinθ is positive and cosθ is negative (as θ is in the second quadrant), we solve for sinθ and cosθ, finding sinθ ≈ 0.8538 and cosθ ≈ -0.5205.5. The equation x² sinθ - y² cosθ = 1 becomes x²*(0.8538) + y²*(0.5205) = 1, which is an ellipse.6. Comparing the coefficients, sinθ > |cosθ|, so 1/sinθ < 1/|cosθ|, meaning the major axis is along the y-axis, hence foci are on the y-axis.Yeah, that makes sense. I think I covered all the steps and double-checked my reasoning. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this conclusion."},{"question":"Given positive numbers a and b satisfying frac {1}{a}+ frac {1}{b}=1, find the minimum value of frac {1}{a-1}+ frac {4}{b-1}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given positive numbers ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy ( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1 ), I need to find the minimum value of ( frac{1}{a - 1} + frac{4}{b - 1} ). Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.First, I know that ( a ) and ( b ) are positive numbers, and the equation ( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1 ) relates them. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other to reduce the problem to a single variable optimization. Let me try that.Starting with the given equation:[frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1]I can solve for ( b ) in terms of ( a ). Let's subtract ( frac{1}{a} ) from both sides:[frac{1}{b} = 1 - frac{1}{a}]Which simplifies to:[frac{1}{b} = frac{a - 1}{a}]Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives:[b = frac{a}{a - 1}]Okay, so now I have ( b ) expressed in terms of ( a ). Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, the denominator ( a - 1 ) must be positive as well, which means ( a > 1 ). Similarly, substituting back into ( b ), since ( a > 1 ), ( b ) will also be positive.Now, I need to find the minimum of ( frac{1}{a - 1} + frac{4}{b - 1} ). Let's substitute ( b ) with ( frac{a}{a - 1} ) in the expression:[frac{1}{a - 1} + frac{4}{frac{a}{a - 1} - 1}]Let me simplify the second term in the expression. The denominator is:[frac{a}{a - 1} - 1 = frac{a - (a - 1)}{a - 1} = frac{1}{a - 1}]So, the second term becomes:[frac{4}{frac{1}{a - 1}} = 4(a - 1)]Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:[frac{1}{a - 1} + 4(a - 1)]Now, I have an expression in terms of a single variable ( a ). Let's denote ( t = a - 1 ), so since ( a > 1 ), ( t > 0 ). Substituting ( t ) into the expression, we get:[frac{1}{t} + 4t]So, now the problem reduces to finding the minimum of ( frac{1}{t} + 4t ) for ( t > 0 ).I remember that for expressions of the form ( frac{k}{t} + mt ), where ( k ) and ( m ) are positive constants, the minimum can be found using the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Applying this to ( frac{1}{t} ) and ( 4t ):Let me write it out:[frac{frac{1}{t} + 4t}{2} geq sqrt{frac{1}{t} times 4t}]Simplifying the right side:[sqrt{frac{4t}{t}} = sqrt{4} = 2]Multiplying both sides by 2:[frac{1}{t} + 4t geq 4]So, the expression ( frac{1}{t} + 4t ) is greater than or equal to 4. Equality holds when ( frac{1}{t} = 4t ), which means:[frac{1}{t} = 4t implies 4t^2 = 1 implies t^2 = frac{1}{4} implies t = frac{1}{2}]Since ( t > 0 ), we discard the negative root.Now, recalling that ( t = a - 1 ), so:[a - 1 = frac{1}{2} implies a = frac{3}{2}]Then, substituting back into ( b = frac{a}{a - 1} ):[b = frac{frac{3}{2}}{frac{3}{2} - 1} = frac{frac{3}{2}}{frac{1}{2}} = 3]So, when ( a = frac{3}{2} ) and ( b = 3 ), the expression ( frac{1}{a - 1} + frac{4}{b - 1} ) reaches its minimum value of 4.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the given equation, I solved for ( b ) in terms of ( a ), substituted into the expression we needed to minimize, simplified it, and then applied the AM-GM inequality. The steps seem logical and I don't see any errors in the algebraic manipulations.Therefore, I'm confident that the minimum value is indeed 4.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies frac {a_{n+1}+a_{n}-3}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}+3}=n, and a_2=10,  (1) Find a_1, a_3, a_4;  (2) Conjecture the general formula for a_n and prove it using mathematical induction;  (3) Determine whether there exists a constant c such that the sequence left{ frac {a_{n}}{n+c}right} forms an arithmetic sequence.

I need to find a_1, a_3, a_4; conjecture a general formula for a_n and prove it by induction; and determine if there's a constant c such that {a_n / (n + c)} is an arithmetic sequence.Starting with part (1): Find a_1, a_3, a_4.Hmm, I have the recursive relation given by that fraction equaling n. Let me write it down:(a_{n+1} + a_n - 3)/(a_{n+1} - a_n + 3) = n.I need to solve for a_{n+1} in terms of a_n. Let me rearrange this equation.Let me denote the equation as:(a_{n+1} + a_n - 3) = n(a_{n+1} - a_n + 3).Expanding the right side:a_{n+1} + a_n - 3 = n*a_{n+1} - n*a_n + 3n.Now, let's collect like terms:Bring all terms involving a_{n+1} to the left and others to the right:a_{n+1} - n*a_{n+1} = -a_n + 3n + 3 - (-n*a_n).Wait, let me do this step by step.Starting from:a_{n+1} + a_n - 3 = n*a_{n+1} - n*a_n + 3n.Subtract n*a_{n+1} from both sides:a_{n+1} - n*a_{n+1} + a_n - 3 = -n*a_n + 3n.Factor a_{n+1} on the left:a_{n+1}(1 - n) + a_n - 3 = -n*a_n + 3n.Now, bring all terms except those with a_{n+1} to the right:a_{n+1}(1 - n) = -n*a_n + 3n - a_n + 3.Factor a_n on the right:a_{n+1}(1 - n) = a_n(-n - 1) + 3n + 3.Factor out -1 from the left side:a_{n+1}(- (n - 1)) = a_n(- (n + 1)) + 3(n + 1).Multiply both sides by -1:a_{n+1}(n - 1) = a_n(n + 1) - 3(n + 1).So,a_{n+1} = [a_n(n + 1) - 3(n + 1)] / (n - 1).Factor out (n + 1):a_{n+1} = (n + 1)(a_n - 3) / (n - 1).Okay, so this is a recursive formula for a_{n+1} in terms of a_n.Given that a_2 = 10, let's find a_1.Wait, n is the index in the original equation. So, if I set n=1, then the equation relates a_2 and a_1.So, for n=1:(a_2 + a_1 - 3)/(a_2 - a_1 + 3) = 1.We know a_2 = 10, so plug that in:(10 + a_1 - 3)/(10 - a_1 + 3) = 1.Simplify numerator and denominator:(7 + a_1)/(13 - a_1) = 1.So, 7 + a_1 = 13 - a_1.Bring terms together:7 + a_1 + a_1 = 13.7 + 2a_1 = 13.2a_1 = 6.a_1 = 3.Okay, so a_1 is 3.Now, let's find a_3.Using the recursive formula:a_{n+1} = (n + 1)(a_n - 3)/(n - 1).So, for n=2:a_3 = (2 + 1)(a_2 - 3)/(2 - 1) = 3*(10 - 3)/1 = 3*7 = 21.So, a_3 = 21.Next, a_4.Using n=3:a_4 = (3 + 1)(a_3 - 3)/(3 - 1) = 4*(21 - 3)/2 = 4*18/2 = 4*9 = 36.So, a_4 = 36.Alright, so part (1) is done: a_1=3, a_3=21, a_4=36.Moving to part (2): Conjecture the general formula for a_n and prove it by induction.Looking at the terms:n | a_n1 | 32 | 103 | 214 | 36Let me see if I can find a pattern.Compute a_n / n:3/1 = 310/2 = 521/3 = 736/4 = 9So, 3, 5, 7, 9... which is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2.So, a_n / n = 2n + 1.Therefore, a_n = n*(2n + 1).Let me check:For n=1: 1*(2*1 +1)=3, correct.n=2: 2*(4 +1)=10, correct.n=3: 3*(6 +1)=21, correct.n=4: 4*(8 +1)=36, correct.So, the conjecture is a_n = n*(2n +1).Now, to prove this by induction.Base case: n=1, a_1=3, which is 1*(2*1 +1)=3, holds.n=2, a_2=10, which is 2*(4 +1)=10, holds.Assume for some k >=2, a_k = k*(2k +1).We need to show that a_{k+1} = (k+1)*(2(k+1)+1) = (k+1)*(2k +3).From the recursive formula:a_{k+1} = (k +1)(a_k -3)/(k -1).Substitute a_k = k*(2k +1):a_{k+1} = (k +1)(k*(2k +1) -3)/(k -1).Simplify numerator:k*(2k +1) -3 = 2k^2 +k -3.Factor numerator:2k^2 +k -3.Let me factor this quadratic:Looking for two numbers m and n such that m*n = 2*(-3) = -6 and m +n =1.Hmm, 3 and -2: 3*(-2) = -6, 3 + (-2)=1.So, split the middle term:2k^2 +3k -2k -3.Group:(2k^2 +3k) + (-2k -3) = k(2k +3) -1(2k +3) = (k -1)(2k +3).So, numerator factors as (k -1)(2k +3).Therefore,a_{k+1} = (k +1)*(k -1)(2k +3)/(k -1).Cancel (k -1):a_{k+1} = (k +1)(2k +3).Which is exactly (k +1)*(2(k +1) +1) = (k+1)*(2k +3).Thus, the formula holds for k+1.Therefore, by induction, a_n = n*(2n +1) for all n >=1.So, part (2) is done.Moving to part (3): Determine if there exists a constant c such that {a_n / (n + c)} is an arithmetic sequence. If exists, find c; else, explain why.So, we need to see if there's a c such that b_n = a_n / (n + c) is arithmetic.Given that a_n = n*(2n +1), so b_n = [n*(2n +1)] / (n + c).We need b_n to be arithmetic, meaning that b_{n+1} - b_n is constant for all n.Let me compute b_n:b_n = [n*(2n +1)] / (n + c).Let me compute b_{n+1} - b_n:= [ (n+1)*(2(n+1) +1) ] / (n +1 + c) - [n*(2n +1)] / (n + c)Simplify:= [ (n+1)*(2n +3) ] / (n +1 + c) - [n*(2n +1)] / (n + c)Let me denote d_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.We need d_n to be constant for all n.Let me compute d_n:= [ (n+1)(2n +3) ] / (n +1 + c) - [n(2n +1)] / (n + c)To combine these fractions, find a common denominator, which is (n +1 + c)(n + c).So,d_n = [ (n+1)(2n +3)(n + c) - n(2n +1)(n +1 + c) ] / [ (n +1 + c)(n + c) ]Let me compute the numerator:Expand both terms:First term: (n+1)(2n +3)(n + c)Let me first compute (n+1)(2n +3):= n*(2n +3) +1*(2n +3) = 2n^2 +3n +2n +3 = 2n^2 +5n +3.Now multiply by (n + c):= (2n^2 +5n +3)(n + c) = 2n^3 + (5 + 2c)n^2 + (3 +5c)n +3c.Second term: n(2n +1)(n +1 + c)First compute (2n +1)(n +1 + c):= 2n*(n +1 +c) +1*(n +1 +c) = 2n^2 +2n +2nc +n +1 +c = 2n^2 + (2 +1 +2c)n +1 +c = 2n^2 + (3 +2c)n +1 +c.Now multiply by n:= n*(2n^2 + (3 +2c)n +1 +c) = 2n^3 + (3 +2c)n^2 + (1 +c)n.So, the numerator is:First term - Second term:[2n^3 + (5 + 2c)n^2 + (3 +5c)n +3c] - [2n^3 + (3 +2c)n^2 + (1 +c)n]Compute term by term:2n^3 -2n^3 = 0.(5 +2c)n^2 - (3 +2c)n^2 = (5 -3) + (2c -2c) = 2n^2.(3 +5c)n - (1 +c)n = (3 -1) + (5c -c) = 2 +4c multiplied by n.Wait, no, wait:Wait, (3 +5c)n - (1 +c)n = (3 -1) + (5c -c) multiplied by n? Wait, no.Wait, it's (3 +5c -1 -c)n = (2 +4c)n.And the constant term: 3c -0 =3c.So, numerator simplifies to:2n^2 + (2 +4c)n +3c.So, d_n = [2n^2 + (2 +4c)n +3c] / [ (n +1 +c)(n + c) ].We need this to be a constant, independent of n.So, for d_n to be constant, the numerator must be a multiple of the denominator.Meaning, 2n^2 + (2 +4c)n +3c = k*(n +1 +c)(n +c), where k is a constant.Let me compute (n +1 +c)(n +c):= n^2 + (1 +2c)n +c(1 +c).So,k*(n^2 + (1 +2c)n +c +c^2) = kn^2 +k(1 +2c)n +k(c +c^2).Set this equal to numerator:2n^2 + (2 +4c)n +3c.Therefore, equate coefficients:For n^2: 2 = k.For n: 2 +4c = k(1 +2c).For constant term: 3c = k(c +c^2).So, from n^2 term: k=2.Now, substitute k=2 into the other equations.For n term:2 +4c = 2*(1 +2c).Simplify right side: 2 +4c.So, 2 +4c = 2 +4c. This is always true, so no new information.For constant term:3c = 2*(c +c^2).Simplify:3c = 2c +2c^2.Bring all terms to left:3c -2c -2c^2 =0 => c -2c^2=0.Factor:c(1 -2c)=0.So, c=0 or c=1/2.Therefore, c can be 0 or 1/2.Now, let's check if these values of c make {a_n / (n +c)} an arithmetic sequence.First, c=0:Then, b_n = a_n / n = [n*(2n +1)] /n = 2n +1.Which is clearly an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2.Second, c=1/2:Then, b_n = a_n / (n +1/2) = [n*(2n +1)] / (n +1/2).Simplify:Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fraction:= [2n*(2n +1)] / (2n +1) = 2n*(2n +1)/(2n +1) = 2n.So, b_n =2n, which is also an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2.Therefore, both c=0 and c=1/2 satisfy the condition.Hence, such constants c exist, and they are c=0 and c=1/2.**Final Answer**(1) ( a_1 = boxed{3} ), ( a_3 = boxed{21} ), ( a_4 = boxed{36} );(2) The general formula is ( a_n = n(2n + 1) ), which has been proven by induction;(3) The constants are ( c = boxed{0} ) and ( c = boxed{dfrac{1}{2}} )."},{"question":"Simplify frac{sqrt{528}}{sqrt{64}} - frac{sqrt{242}}{sqrt{121}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem to simplify the expression (frac{sqrt{528}}{sqrt{64}} - frac{sqrt{242}}{sqrt{121}}). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that when you have a square root in the numerator and another in the denominator, you can combine them under a single square root. So, I can rewrite each fraction as a single square root by dividing the numbers inside. That is, (frac{sqrt{a}}{sqrt{b}} = sqrt{frac{a}{b}}). Let me apply that to both terms.Starting with the first term, (frac{sqrt{528}}{sqrt{64}}), this becomes (sqrt{frac{528}{64}}). Now, I need to simplify (frac{528}{64}). Let me do that division. 64 goes into 528 how many times? Well, 64 times 8 is 512, which is close to 528. So, 528 divided by 64 is 8.25. So, the first term simplifies to (sqrt{8.25}).Hmm, (sqrt{8.25}) isn't a perfect square, but maybe I can express it in a simpler radical form. Let me see. 8.25 is the same as (frac{33}{4}), because 33 divided by 4 is 8.25. So, (sqrt{frac{33}{4}}) is the same as (frac{sqrt{33}}{2}). That seems better because it's expressed with a radical in the numerator.Now, moving on to the second term, (frac{sqrt{242}}{sqrt{121}}). Again, using the same property, this becomes (sqrt{frac{242}{121}}). Let me simplify (frac{242}{121}). Well, 121 times 2 is 242, so this simplifies to 2. Therefore, the second term is (sqrt{2}).So, now my expression is (frac{sqrt{33}}{2} - sqrt{2}). I need to see if I can simplify this further or if this is the simplest form. Let me check if (sqrt{33}) can be simplified. 33 factors into 3 and 11, neither of which are perfect squares, so (sqrt{33}) is already in its simplest form. Similarly, (sqrt{2}) is also in its simplest form.Since both terms are now simplified and there are no like terms to combine, this should be the final simplified expression. However, if I wanted to express this as a decimal, I could approximate the values. Let me do that quickly to verify.Calculating (sqrt{33}), I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so (sqrt{33}) is approximately 5.7446. Dividing that by 2 gives me about 2.8723. Then, (sqrt{2}) is approximately 1.4142. Subtracting these, 2.8723 minus 1.4142 equals approximately 1.4581.Wait a minute, in my initial thought process, I thought it was 1.461, but now it's 1.4581. That's a slight discrepancy. Maybe I made a rounding error earlier. Let me check my calculations again.Calculating (sqrt{33}) more accurately: 5.744562649. Divided by 2 is 2.8722813245. (sqrt{2}) is approximately 1.4142135624. Subtracting these gives 2.8722813245 - 1.4142135624 = 1.4580677621. So, approximately 1.4581, which is about 1.458. Earlier, I thought it was 1.461, but that might have been due to rounding too early in the steps.But since the problem asks for simplification, not a decimal approximation, the exact form is (frac{sqrt{33}}{2} - sqrt{2}). However, sometimes problems prefer combining terms over a common denominator or expressing it differently. Let me see if that's possible.If I want to write both terms with the same denominator, I can express (sqrt{2}) as (frac{2sqrt{2}}{2}). Then, the expression becomes (frac{sqrt{33} - 2sqrt{2}}{2}). This might be considered a more simplified form because it's a single fraction.Alternatively, if I leave it as (frac{sqrt{33}}{2} - sqrt{2}), that's also acceptable. It depends on what the problem considers as simplified. Since both forms are correct, I think expressing it as (frac{sqrt{33} - 2sqrt{2}}{2}) is a bit more concise.Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with (frac{sqrt{528}}{sqrt{64}}), simplifying to (sqrt{8.25}) which is (frac{sqrt{33}}{2}). Then, (frac{sqrt{242}}{sqrt{121}}) simplifies to (sqrt{2}). Subtracting these gives (frac{sqrt{33}}{2} - sqrt{2}), which I can write as (frac{sqrt{33} - 2sqrt{2}}{2}). That seems correct.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work for accuracy. So, the simplified form of the original expression is (frac{sqrt{33} - 2sqrt{2}}{2})."},{"question":"What is the double of quarter of 4 percent written as a decimal?","answer":"First, I need to understand what a quarter of 4 percent means.

I need to prove that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) is greater than or equal to 4 + 1/sin(C/2). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I know that in any triangle, the sides are related to the angles through the Law of Sines. So, maybe I can express the sides a, b, and c in terms of the angles. The Law of Sines says that a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C) = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, I can write a = 2R sin(A), b = 2R sin(B), and c = 2R sin(C). Maybe substituting these into the expression will help.Let me try that. So, (a + b) becomes 2R(sin(A) + sin(B)), and (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) becomes (1/(2R sin(A)) + 1/(2R sin(B)) + 1/(2R sin(C))). So, when I multiply them together, the 2R terms will cancel out, right? Let me write that out:(2R(sin(A) + sin(B))) * (1/(2R sin(A)) + 1/(2R sin(B)) + 1/(2R sin(C))) = (sin(A) + sin(B)) * (1/sin(A) + 1/sin(B) + 1/sin(C)).Okay, so that simplifies the expression a bit. Now, I need to work with (sin(A) + sin(B))(1/sin(A) + 1/sin(B) + 1/sin(C)). Let me expand this product.Multiplying sin(A) with each term in the second parenthesis: sin(A)/sin(A) + sin(A)/sin(B) + sin(A)/sin(C). Similarly, multiplying sin(B) with each term: sin(B)/sin(A) + sin(B)/sin(B) + sin(B)/sin(C). So, combining all these terms:1 + sin(A)/sin(B) + sin(A)/sin(C) + sin(B)/sin(A) + 1 + sin(B)/sin(C).Simplifying, that's 2 + sin(A)/sin(B) + sin(B)/sin(A) + sin(A)/sin(C) + sin(B)/sin(C). Hmm, okay. So, now I have:2 + [sin(A)/sin(B) + sin(B)/sin(A)] + [sin(A) + sin(B)]/sin(C).I know that sin(A)/sin(B) + sin(B)/sin(A) is equal to [sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)). Maybe that can be simplified or bounded somehow.Also, [sin(A) + sin(B)]/sin(C) can be written as [2 sin((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2)] / sin(C). Since in a triangle, A + B + C = 180 degrees, so A + B = 180 - C. Therefore, sin((A+B)/2) = sin(90 - C/2) = cos(C/2). So, [sin(A) + sin(B)]/sin(C) = [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C).Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:2 + [sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C).I need to show that this is greater than or equal to 4 + 1/sin(C/2). So, let me write the inequality:2 + [sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) ≥ 4 + 1/sin(C/2).Subtracting 2 from both sides:[sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) ≥ 2 + 1/sin(C/2).Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can handle each term separately.First, [sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)). I know that sin^2(A) + sin^2(B) can be written as [sin(A) - sin(B)]^2 + 2 sin(A) sin(B). So, [sin^2(A) + sin^2(B)]/(sin(A)sin(B)) = [sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)) + 2.Therefore, the expression becomes:[sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)) + 2 + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) ≥ 2 + 1/sin(C/2).Subtracting 2 from both sides again:[sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) ≥ 1/sin(C/2).So, now I have:[sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) ≥ 1/sin(C/2).I need to show that this inequality holds given that angle C is at least 60 degrees.Let me consider the term [sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)). Since sin(A) and sin(B) are positive in a triangle, this term is always non-negative. So, the first part is non-negative, and the second part is positive because cos(C/2) and cos((A - B)/2) are positive (since angles are less than 90 degrees in a triangle, except maybe C, but C is at least 60, so C/2 is at least 30, so cos(C/2) is positive). So, both terms on the left are positive, and I need to show their sum is at least 1/sin(C/2).Hmm, maybe I can find a lower bound for each term or combine them in some way.Let me also note that in a triangle, A + B = 180 - C, so A and B are related. Maybe I can express A and B in terms of C or some other variable.Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.Looking at [sin(A) - sin(B)]^2/(sin(A)sin(B)), I can write this as [2 cos((A+B)/2) sin((A - B)/2)]^2 / (sin(A) sin(B)). Which is 4 cos^2((A+B)/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)).Similarly, [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C) can be written as [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / (2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2)) ) = [cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C/2).So, substituting these back in, the left-hand side becomes:4 cos^2((A+B)/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2).So, now the inequality is:4 cos^2((A+B)/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Subtracting cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) from both sides:4 cos^2((A+B)/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) ≥ [1 - cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C/2).Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find a way to relate sin(A) sin(B) to something else.Wait, in a triangle, A + B = 180 - C, so (A + B)/2 = 90 - C/2. Therefore, cos((A + B)/2) = cos(90 - C/2) = sin(C/2). So, cos^2((A + B)/2) = sin^2(C/2).So, substituting that back in, the first term becomes:4 sin^2(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)).So, now the inequality is:4 sin^2(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Subtracting cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) from both sides:4 sin^2(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) ≥ [1 - cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C/2).Hmm, I can factor the numerator on the right-hand side as 2 sin^2((A - B)/4), using the identity 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2). So, 1 - cos((A - B)/2) = 2 sin^2((A - B)/4).So, the right-hand side becomes 2 sin^2((A - B)/4) / sin(C/2).Therefore, the inequality is:4 sin^2(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) ≥ 2 sin^2((A - B)/4) / sin(C/2).Simplifying both sides by dividing by 2:2 sin^2(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) ≥ sin^2((A - B)/4) / sin(C/2).Multiplying both sides by sin(C/2):2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / (sin(A) sin(B)) ≥ sin^2((A - B)/4).Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe I can find a relationship between sin(A) sin(B) and something else.Wait, in a triangle, A + B = 180 - C, so sin(A) sin(B) can be expressed using the identity:sin(A) sin(B) = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2 = [cos(A - B) - cos(180 - C)] / 2 = [cos(A - B) + cos(C)] / 2.So, sin(A) sin(B) = [cos(A - B) + cos(C)] / 2.Therefore, substituting back in, the left-hand side becomes:2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / ([cos(A - B) + cos(C)] / 2) = 4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos(A - B) + cos(C)].So, the inequality is now:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos(A - B) + cos(C)] ≥ sin^2((A - B)/4).Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can manipulate this further.I can write cos(A - B) as 1 - 2 sin^2((A - B)/2), using the identity cos(theta) = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2). Similarly, cos(C) can be written as 1 - 2 sin^2(C/2).So, cos(A - B) + cos(C) = [1 - 2 sin^2((A - B)/2)] + [1 - 2 sin^2(C/2)] = 2 - 2 [sin^2((A - B)/2) + sin^2(C/2)].Therefore, the denominator becomes 2 [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].So, substituting back in, the left-hand side is:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [2 (1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2))] = 2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].So, the inequality is:2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)] ≥ sin^2((A - B)/4).Hmm, this is still quite complex. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify things. Let me let x = (A - B)/2. Then, (A - B)/4 = x/2. Also, since A + B = 180 - C, and C is at least 60 degrees, so A + B is at most 120 degrees. Therefore, x = (A - B)/2, so A = B + 2x, and since A + B = 180 - C, substituting gives B + 2x + B = 180 - C, so 2B + 2x = 180 - C, so B = (180 - C - 2x)/2 = 90 - C/2 - x.But I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that angle C is at least 60 degrees, so sin(C/2) is at least sin(30) = 1/2. So, sin(C/2) ≥ 1/2.Given that, maybe I can find a lower bound for the left-hand side.Wait, looking back at the original expression:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).I can also think of this as (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) + (a + b)/c. The first part, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b), is equal to 2 + a/b + b/a, which is always greater than or equal to 4 by AM-GM inequality, since a/b + b/a ≥ 2. So, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) ≥ 4.Therefore, the entire expression is at least 4 + (a + b)/c. So, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + (a + b)/c.So, if I can show that (a + b)/c ≥ 1/sin(C/2), then the inequality would follow.Wait, but is (a + b)/c ≥ 1/sin(C/2)?Let me check. From the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin(A), b = 2R sin(B), c = 2R sin(C). So, (a + b)/c = [2R(sin(A) + sin(B))]/(2R sin(C)) = [sin(A) + sin(B)] / sin(C).As I did earlier, [sin(A) + sin(B)] / sin(C) = [2 cos((A + B)/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C). Since A + B = 180 - C, cos((A + B)/2) = cos(90 - C/2) = sin(C/2). So, this becomes [2 sin(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / sin(C).But sin(C) = 2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2). So, substituting, we get [2 sin(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / [2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2)] = cos((A - B)/2) / cos(C/2).So, (a + b)/c = cos((A - B)/2) / cos(C/2). Therefore, the inequality I need is:cos((A - B)/2) / cos(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Which simplifies to:cos((A - B)/2) ≥ cos(C/2) / sin(C/2) = cot(C/2).But cot(C/2) is equal to [1 + cos(C)] / sin(C). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, but since angle C is at least 60 degrees, C/2 is at least 30 degrees, so cot(C/2) is at most cot(30) = √3. On the other hand, cos((A - B)/2) is at most 1, since cosine is at most 1. So, unless cos((A - B)/2) is greater than or equal to cot(C/2), which is √3, but cos((A - B)/2) can't be more than 1, and √3 is about 1.732, which is greater than 1. So, this approach might not work.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps instead of trying to bound (a + b)/c, I should go back to the earlier expression and see if I can find another way.Wait, earlier I had:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos(A - B) + cos(C)] ≥ sin^2((A - B)/4).Maybe I can use some inequality here. Since angle C is at least 60 degrees, sin(C/2) is at least 1/2, so sin^3(C/2) is at least 1/8. Also, sin^2((A - B)/2) is non-negative.But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that cos(A - B) + cos(C) is less than or equal to 2, since both cosines are at most 1. So, the denominator is at most 2, so the left-hand side is at least 2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2).But I need to compare this to sin^2((A - B)/4). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the double-angle identity for cosine. Let me recall that cos(theta) = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2). So, cos(A - B) = 1 - 2 sin^2((A - B)/2), and cos(C) = 1 - 2 sin^2(C/2). Therefore, cos(A - B) + cos(C) = 2 - 2 [sin^2((A - B)/2) + sin^2(C/2)].So, the denominator is 2 [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].So, the left-hand side becomes:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [2 (1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2))] = 2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].Hmm, this seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can factor the denominator as [1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)] = [cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].Wait, because 1 - sin^2(theta) = cos^2(theta), so 1 - sin^2((A - B)/2) = cos^2((A - B)/2). Therefore, the denominator is cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2).So, the left-hand side is:2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].I need this to be greater than or equal to sin^2((A - B)/4).Hmm, perhaps I can write sin^2((A - B)/4) as [1 - cos((A - B)/2)] / 2, using the identity sin^2(theta) = (1 - cos(2 theta))/2.So, sin^2((A - B)/4) = [1 - cos((A - B)/2)] / 2.So, the inequality becomes:2 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)] ≥ [1 - cos((A - B)/2)] / 2.Multiplying both sides by 2:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)] ≥ 1 - cos((A - B)/2).Hmm, maybe I can factor the denominator as [cos((A - B)/2) - sin(C/2)][cos((A - B)/2) + sin(C/2)].So, the left-hand side becomes:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2) / [ (cos((A - B)/2) - sin(C/2))(cos((A - B)/2) + sin(C/2)) ].I wonder if I can find a way to bound this expression.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that angle C is at least 60 degrees, so sin(C/2) is at least 1/2, and angle (A - B)/2 is less than 90 degrees, so cos((A - B)/2) is positive.Wait, maybe I can consider the ratio:[4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2((A - B)/2)] / [cos^2((A - B)/2) - sin^2(C/2)].Let me denote x = (A - B)/2, so the expression becomes:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) / [cos^2(x) - sin^2(C/2)].I need to show that this is greater than or equal to 1 - cos(x).Hmm, maybe I can write this as:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) / [cos^2(x) - sin^2(C/2)] ≥ 1 - cos(x).Let me rearrange this inequality:4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) ≥ (1 - cos(x)) [cos^2(x) - sin^2(C/2)].Expanding the right-hand side:(1 - cos(x)) cos^2(x) - (1 - cos(x)) sin^2(C/2).So, 4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) + (1 - cos(x)) sin^2(C/2) ≥ (1 - cos(x)) cos^2(x).Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe I can factor out (1 - cos(x)):4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) + (1 - cos(x)) sin^2(C/2) - (1 - cos(x)) cos^2(x) ≥ 0.Factor out (1 - cos(x)):(1 - cos(x)) [sin^2(C/2) - cos^2(x)] + 4 sin^3(C/2) sin^2(x) ≥ 0.Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, going back to the original expression:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + 1/sin(C/2).I already know that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) ≥ 4, so the remaining term is (a + b)/c. So, if I can show that (a + b)/c ≥ 1/sin(C/2), then adding it to 4 would give the desired inequality.But earlier, I found that (a + b)/c = cos((A - B)/2) / cos(C/2). So, I need to show that cos((A - B)/2) / cos(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Which simplifies to cos((A - B)/2) ≥ cot(C/2).But as I thought earlier, cot(C/2) is √3 when C = 60 degrees, and cos((A - B)/2) is at most 1, which is less than √3. So, this approach doesn't seem to work.Hmm, maybe I need to consider another identity or inequality. Perhaps using the fact that in any triangle, the sum of two sides is greater than the third side. So, a + b > c. But I don't know if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-HM inequality on a and b. The AM-HM inequality states that (a + b)/2 ≥ 2ab/(a + b), which implies that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) ≥ 4. So, that's where the 4 comes from in the inequality.But I need to get the additional term involving 1/sin(C/2). Maybe I can relate (a + b)/c to some trigonometric function.Wait, from earlier, (a + b)/c = [sin(A) + sin(B)] / sin(C). And since A + B = 180 - C, we can write [sin(A) + sin(B)] = 2 sin((A + B)/2) cos((A - B)/2) = 2 sin(90 - C/2) cos((A - B)/2) = 2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2).Therefore, (a + b)/c = 2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C). But sin(C) = 2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2), so substituting, we get:(a + b)/c = [2 cos(C/2) cos((A - B)/2)] / [2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2)] = cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2).So, (a + b)/c = cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2).Therefore, the original expression is:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) + (a + b)/c ≥ 4 + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2).So, I need to show that 4 + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 4 + 1 / sin(C/2).Which simplifies to cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Since sin(C/2) is positive, we can multiply both sides by sin(C/2) without changing the inequality:cos((A - B)/2) ≥ 1.But cos(theta) is at most 1, so this would require cos((A - B)/2) = 1, which happens only when (A - B)/2 = 0, i.e., A = B.Therefore, the inequality (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + 1/sin(C/2) holds with equality if and only if A = B, i.e., the triangle is isoceles with A = B.But wait, this contradicts the earlier step where I thought cos((A - B)/2) ≥ 1, which is only possible if (A - B)/2 = 0. So, does this mean that the inequality is actually an equality only when A = B, and otherwise, it's greater?Wait, no, because in the step where I said (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + (a + b)/c, and then (a + b)/c = cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2), which is less than or equal to 1 / sin(C/2), since cos((A - B)/2) ≤ 1.Wait, so actually, (a + b)/c ≤ 1 / sin(C/2), which would mean that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + (a + b)/c ≤ 4 + 1 / sin(C/2). But that's the opposite of what we need.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.Wait, let's recap. I have:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) + (a + b)/c ≥ 4 + (a + b)/c.But (a + b)/c = cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2). So, the expression is at least 4 + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2).But I need to show that this is at least 4 + 1 / sin(C/2). So, 4 + cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 4 + 1 / sin(C/2).Which simplifies to cos((A - B)/2) / sin(C/2) ≥ 1 / sin(C/2).Since sin(C/2) is positive, we can multiply both sides by sin(C/2):cos((A - B)/2) ≥ 1.But cosine is at most 1, so this inequality holds only when cos((A - B)/2) = 1, which is when (A - B)/2 = 0, i.e., A = B.Therefore, the inequality (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + 1/sin(C/2) holds with equality if and only if A = B, and otherwise, it's greater.Wait, but the problem states that angle C is at least 60 degrees. So, in that case, if C is exactly 60 degrees, then sin(C/2) = sin(30) = 1/2, so 1/sin(C/2) = 2.But in an equilateral triangle where A = B = C = 60 degrees, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (a + a)(1/a + 1/a + 1/a) = 2a * 3/a = 6. And 4 + 1/sin(30) = 4 + 2 = 6. So, equality holds.But if C is greater than 60 degrees, say 90 degrees, then sin(C/2) = sin(45) = √2/2, so 1/sin(C/2) = √2 ≈ 1.414. So, 4 + √2 ≈ 5.414.But in a triangle with C = 90 degrees, let's say it's a right-angled triangle with sides 1, 1, √2. Then, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1 + 1/√2) = 2*(2 + 1/√2) ≈ 2*(2 + 0.707) ≈ 2*2.707 ≈ 5.414, which is equal to 4 + √2. So, equality holds here as well.Wait, but in this case, A = B = 45 degrees, so A = B, which is why equality holds.But what if A ≠ B? Let's take a triangle with C = 60 degrees, but A ≠ B. For example, let me take A = 50 degrees, B = 70 degrees, C = 60 degrees.Then, using the Law of Sines, a / sin(50) = b / sin(70) = c / sin(60). Let's assume c = 1 for simplicity, so a = sin(50)/sin(60) ≈ 0.7660 / 0.8660 ≈ 0.884, and b = sin(70)/sin(60) ≈ 0.9397 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.085.Then, (a + b) ≈ 0.884 + 1.085 ≈ 1.969.1/a + 1/b + 1/c ≈ 1/0.884 + 1/1.085 + 1 ≈ 1.131 + 0.922 + 1 ≈ 3.053.So, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≈ 1.969 * 3.053 ≈ 6.023.On the other hand, 4 + 1/sin(30) = 4 + 2 = 6.So, 6.023 ≥ 6, which holds.Similarly, if I take C = 90 degrees, A = 30 degrees, B = 60 degrees.Then, a = sin(30)/sin(90) = 0.5, b = sin(60)/sin(90) ≈ 0.866, c = 1.(a + b) ≈ 0.5 + 0.866 ≈ 1.366.1/a + 1/b + 1/c ≈ 2 + 1.1547 + 1 ≈ 4.1547.So, (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≈ 1.366 * 4.1547 ≈ 5.685.And 4 + 1/sin(45) ≈ 4 + 1.414 ≈ 5.414.So, 5.685 ≥ 5.414, which holds.But in this case, A ≠ B, yet the inequality still holds. So, my earlier conclusion that equality holds only when A = B seems to be contradicted by the case where C = 60 degrees and A ≠ B, but the inequality still holds.Wait, but in the case where C = 60 degrees and A = B, we have equality, but when A ≠ B, the left-hand side is greater. So, the inequality is actually stronger when A ≠ B.Therefore, perhaps the inequality holds in general, and the equality occurs when A = B.But in the problem statement, it's given that angle C is at least 60 degrees, so maybe the inequality is always true under that condition.Alternatively, perhaps I need to use some other inequality, like Cauchy-Schwarz or something else.Wait, let me try using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms (a + b) and (1/a + 1/b + 1/c).But Cauchy-Schwarz says that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) ≥ (1 + 1)^2 = 4, which is where the 4 comes from.But I need to handle the 1/c term as well.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality on the entire expression.But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to consider substituting variables.Let me set x = A - B. Then, since A + B = 180 - C, we can express A and B in terms of x and C.But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(x) = (a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) and find its minimum given that angle C is at least 60 degrees.But that might be complicated.Wait, another idea: since angle C is fixed, maybe I can express everything in terms of angle C and the difference between angles A and B.Let me denote D = A - B, so A = (180 - C)/2 + D/2, and B = (180 - C)/2 - D/2.Then, sin(A) = sin[(90 - C/2) + D/2] = sin(90 - C/2 + D/2) = cos(C/2 - D/2).Similarly, sin(B) = sin[(90 - C/2) - D/2] = cos(C/2 + D/2).So, sin(A) = cos(C/2 - D/2), sin(B) = cos(C/2 + D/2).Therefore, sin(A) + sin(B) = cos(C/2 - D/2) + cos(C/2 + D/2) = 2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2).Similarly, sin(A) sin(B) = cos(C/2 - D/2) cos(C/2 + D/2) = cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2).So, going back to the expression:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = (sin(A) + sin(B))(1/sin(A) + 1/sin(B) + 1/sin(C)).Substituting the expressions in terms of C and D:= [2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] * [1/cos(C/2 - D/2) + 1/cos(C/2 + D/2) + 1/sin(C)].Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.First, let's compute 1/cos(C/2 - D/2) + 1/cos(C/2 + D/2).Using the identity 1/cos(theta) = sec(theta), and perhaps using sum formulas.Alternatively, I can write 1/cos(C/2 - D/2) + 1/cos(C/2 + D/2) = [cos(C/2 + D/2) + cos(C/2 - D/2)] / [cos(C/2 - D/2) cos(C/2 + D/2)].The numerator is 2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2), and the denominator is cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2).So, 1/cos(C/2 - D/2) + 1/cos(C/2 + D/2) = [2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] / [cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2)].Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] * [2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2) / (cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2))] + [2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] / sin(C).Simplifying, the first term is:4 cos^2(C/2) cos^2(D/2) / (cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2)).And the second term is:[2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] / sin(C).So, the entire expression is:4 cos^2(C/2) cos^2(D/2) / (cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(D/2)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos(D/2)] / sin(C).I need to show that this is at least 4 + 1/sin(C/2).Hmm, this is still quite involved. Maybe I can consider specific cases or try to find a way to bound this expression.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that angle C is at least 60 degrees, so C/2 is at least 30 degrees, and thus sin(C/2) is at least 1/2.Wait, another idea: maybe I can use the substitution t = D/2, so D = 2t. Then, the expression becomes:4 cos^2(C/2) cos^2(t) / (cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(t)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos(t)] / sin(C).I need to show that this is at least 4 + 1/sin(C/2).But I'm not sure if this substitution helps.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(t) = 4 cos^2(C/2) cos^2(t) / (cos^2(C/2) - sin^2(t)) + [2 cos(C/2) cos(t)] / sin(C), and find its minimum over t.But that might be too complicated.Wait, perhaps I can consider the case when D = 0, i.e., A = B. Then, t = 0, and the expression simplifies to:4 cos^2(C/2) * 1 / cos^2(C/2) + [2 cos(C/2) * 1] / sin(C) = 4 + [2 cos(C/2)] / sin(C).But sin(C) = 2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2), so [2 cos(C/2)] / sin(C) = [2 cos(C/2)] / [2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2)] = 1 / sin(C/2).Therefore, when D = 0, the expression is equal to 4 + 1/sin(C/2), which matches the right-hand side of the inequality.So, in this case, equality holds when D = 0, i.e., when A = B.But when D ≠ 0, i.e., when A ≠ B, the expression is greater than 4 + 1/sin(C/2).Therefore, the inequality holds, and equality occurs when A = B.So, putting it all together, we have shown that:(a + b)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) ≥ 4 + 1/sin(C/2),with equality if and only if A = B, i.e., the triangle is isoceles with A = B.Therefore, the proof is complete."},{"question":"In the coordinate plane, squares are considered such that all vertices have natural number coordinates and the center is at the point (55, 40). Find the number of such squares.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about squares on a coordinate plane. The center of each square is at (55, 40), and all the vertices must have natural number coordinates. I need to find how many such squares exist. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that a square has four vertices, and the center is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the center is at (55, 40), then the coordinates of the vertices must be symmetric around this point. That means if one vertex is at (x, y), the opposite vertex should be at (110 - x, 80 - y). Wait, is that right? Let me check: the midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So if the midpoint is (55, 40), then x1 + x2 = 110 and y1 + y2 = 80. Yeah, so that's correct.Now, all the vertices must have natural number coordinates, which means each coordinate must be a positive integer. So, for each vertex (x, y), x and y must be positive integers, and the opposite vertex will be (110 - x, 80 - y). Also, since it's a square, the distance between adjacent vertices must be equal, and the sides must be perpendicular.I think there are two cases to consider here: squares that are axis-aligned and squares that are rotated. Let me start with the axis-aligned squares because they might be simpler.**Case 1: Axis-Aligned Squares**If the square is axis-aligned, then its sides are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis. In this case, the vertices will lie on the lines x = 55 and y = 40. Let me visualize this: the center is at (55, 40), so the square will extend equally in all four directions from this center.Let’s denote the half-length of the side as 'k'. So, each side of the square will be 2k units long. Then, the vertices will be at (55 + k, 40 + k), (55 + k, 40 - k), (55 - k, 40 - k), and (55 - k, 40 + k). Since all these coordinates must be natural numbers, k must be a positive integer such that 55 - k ≥ 1 and 40 - k ≥ 1. That means k can be at most 39 because 55 - 39 = 16 and 40 - 39 = 1. So, k can range from 1 to 39.Therefore, there are 39 such axis-aligned squares.**Case 2: Rotated Squares**Now, the more complicated case is when the square is rotated, meaning its sides are not parallel to the axes. In this case, the vertices will still be symmetric around the center (55, 40), but their coordinates won't necessarily lie on the lines x = 55 or y = 40.Let me think about how to model this. For a square centered at (55, 40), the vertices can be represented as (55 + a, 40 + b), (55 + b, 40 - a), (55 - a, 40 - b), and (55 - b, 40 + a), where 'a' and 'b' are integers. This is because a rotation by 90 degrees swaps the coordinates and changes their signs appropriately.Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. If I rotate a point (a, b) by 90 degrees counterclockwise around the center, it becomes (-b, a). But since we're rotating around (55, 40), we need to translate the coordinates so that the center becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back.So, the general formula for rotating a point (x, y) around (h, k) by 90 degrees counterclockwise is:x' = h - (y - k)  y' = k + (x - h)So, applying this to a point (55 + a, 40 + b):x' = 55 - (40 + b - 40) = 55 - b  y' = 40 + (55 + a - 55) = 40 + aSo, the rotated point is (55 - b, 40 + a). Similarly, applying this rotation again would give another vertex, and so on.Therefore, the four vertices of the square can be represented as:1. (55 + a, 40 + b)  2. (55 - b, 40 + a)  3. (55 - a, 40 - b)  4. (55 + b, 40 - a)All these points must have natural number coordinates. So, for each of these points, the x and y coordinates must be positive integers.Let me write down the conditions for each point:1. (55 + a, 40 + b):     55 + a ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≥ -54 (but since a is a positive integer, this is automatically satisfied)     40 + b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≥ -39 (similarly, b is positive, so okay)2. (55 - b, 40 + a):     55 - b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≤ 54     40 + a ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≥ -39 (again, a is positive)3. (55 - a, 40 - b):     55 - a ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≤ 54     40 - b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≤ 394. (55 + b, 40 - a):     55 + b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≥ -54 (b is positive)     40 - a ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≤ 39So, combining all these conditions, we have:- a must be ≤ 39 (from condition 4)  - b must be ≤ 39 (from condition 3)Also, since a and b are positive integers, they can range from 1 to 39.But wait, is that all? Let me think. Each square is determined by a pair (a, b), but we have to ensure that the sides are equal and the angles are right angles. Since we derived the coordinates based on rotation, this should inherently satisfy the square properties. So, as long as a and b are positive integers between 1 and 39, the resulting figure will be a square with natural coordinates.However, I need to make sure that each pair (a, b) gives a unique square. For example, if I take (a, b) and (b, a), do they result in the same square? Let me check:If I take (a, b) = (1, 2), the vertices are:1. (56, 42)  2. (53, 41)  3. (54, 38)  4. (57, 39)If I take (a, b) = (2, 1), the vertices are:1. (57, 41)  2. (54, 42)  3. (53, 39)  4. (56, 40)These are different squares, so (a, b) and (b, a) give distinct squares. Therefore, each pair (a, b) with a and b from 1 to 39 gives a unique square.So, how many such squares are there? Since a and b can each independently range from 1 to 39, the total number is 39 * 39 = 1521.But wait, hold on. Are all these squares distinct? What if a = b? For example, if a = b = 1, the square is:1. (56, 41)  2. (54, 41)  3. (54, 39)  4. (56, 39)This is actually a square with side length sqrt(2), but it's still a valid square. So, even when a = b, it's a valid square, just rotated 45 degrees relative to the axis-aligned squares.Therefore, all 1521 squares are valid and distinct.**Combining Both Cases**So, in total, we have:- 39 axis-aligned squares  - 1521 rotated squaresAdding them together, the total number of squares is 39 + 1521 = 1560.Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any overlap between the axis-aligned squares and the rotated squares? For example, could a square be both axis-aligned and rotated? I don't think so because an axis-aligned square cannot be rotated unless it's a different square. So, these two cases are mutually exclusive.Therefore, the total number of squares is indeed 1560.**Final Answer**The number of such squares is boxed{1560}."},{"question":"Let U = mathbb{R}, M = {x | x^{2}+2x-8 leq 0}, N = {x | -1 < x < 3}.

Let me try to understand what each set is first.Set M is defined as all real numbers x such that x squared plus 2x minus 8 is less than or equal to zero. That sounds like a quadratic inequality. I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I need to find the roots of the equation first and then determine the intervals where the inequality holds.So, let me write down the equation: x² + 2x - 8 = 0. To solve this, I can try factoring. Let me see, I need two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to 2. Hmm, 4 and -2 work because 4 * (-2) = -8 and 4 + (-2) = 2. So, the equation factors to (x + 4)(x - 2) = 0. That means the roots are x = -4 and x = 2.Now, since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of x² is positive), the graph will be a parabola that opens upwards with its vertex between x = -4 and x = 2. The inequality x² + 2x - 8 ≤ 0 will be true between the roots because the parabola is below or on the x-axis there. So, set M is all real numbers x where -4 ≤ x ≤ 2.Next, set N is given as all real numbers x such that -1 < x < 3. That's straightforward; it's just an open interval from -1 to 3.Now, I need to find the complement of M with respect to the real numbers, which is everything not in M. Since M is [-4, 2], the complement of M, denoted as ∁ℝM, would be all real numbers less than -4 or greater than 2. So, ∁ℝM = (-∞, -4) ∪ (2, ∞).Finally, I need to find the intersection of ∁ℝM and N. The intersection means all numbers that are in both sets. So, ∁ℝM is (-∞, -4) ∪ (2, ∞), and N is (-1, 3). Let's see where these overlap.Looking at (-∞, -4) and (-1, 3), there's no overlap because -4 is less than -1, so the interval (-∞, -4) doesn't intersect with (-1, 3). Now, looking at (2, ∞) and (-1, 3), the overlap would be from 2 to 3 because that's where both intervals are present. So, the intersection is (2, 3).Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Set M is [-4, 2], so its complement is everything outside that interval. N is (-1, 3), which is a subset of the real numbers. The overlap between the complement of M and N should be the part of N that's not in M. Since M goes up to 2, and N goes up to 3, the part of N that's not in M is from 2 to 3. So, yes, that seems correct.I think I got it right. The intersection of the complement of M and N is the open interval from 2 to 3."},{"question":"In a new triangle diagram, triangle ABD is a 15-75-90 triangle with AD=10, and triangle ACD is a 45-45-90 triangle.

Triangle ABD is a 15-75-90 triangle, and triangle ACD is a 45-45-90 triangle. I need to find the length of side CD, and they've given me that AD is 10 units long.First, let me try to visualize the diagram. There's a point A at the origin, connected to points B, C, and D. Triangle ABD is a 15-75-90 triangle, which means one angle is 15 degrees, another is 75 degrees, and the right angle is at point D. Triangle ACD is a 45-45-90 triangle, so both angles at A and C are 45 degrees, making it an isosceles right triangle.I think the key here is to use the properties of these special triangles to find the lengths of the sides. Since AD is given as 10, and in triangle ACD, which is a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides opposite the 45-degree angles are equal. That means AC should be equal to AD, right? Wait, no, hold on. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg times sqrt(2). So if AD is one of the legs, then AC should also be 10, and CD, the hypotenuse, would be 10*sqrt(2). But I need to make sure that this makes sense with the other triangle, ABD.Let me think about triangle ABD. It's a 15-75-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in a specific ratio. I remember that in a 15-75-90 triangle, the sides opposite these angles are in the ratio of 1 : (2 + sqrt(3)) : (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2. But I might be mixing up the ratios. Maybe I should use trigonometric functions to find the lengths.Since AD is 10 and it's the side opposite the 15-degree angle in triangle ABD, I can use the tangent function. The tangent of 15 degrees is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side. So, tan(15°) = AB / AD. Therefore, AB = AD * tan(15°). I know that tan(15°) is 2 - sqrt(3), so AB = 10 * (2 - sqrt(3)). That gives me the length of AB.Now, looking back at triangle ACD, which is a 45-45-90 triangle, I can find CD. Since AC is equal to AD, which is 10, then CD, being the hypotenuse, is 10*sqrt(2). But wait, does this make sense with the rest of the diagram? Is CD connected to point B? Or is it a separate triangle?Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems that point C is connected to point D, and point B is connected to point D as well. So, CD is a separate side from AB. Therefore, the length of CD should be 10*sqrt(2), regardless of the other triangle.But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any relationship between triangles ABD and ACD that I'm missing. Since both triangles share the side AD, which is 10, and point D is common to both, perhaps there's a way to relate AB and AC. But in triangle ABD, AB is 10*(2 - sqrt(3)), and in triangle ACD, AC is 10. These are different lengths, so they don't directly affect each other.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. CD is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle with legs of length 10, so CD is 10*sqrt(2).Wait, but in the Asymptote code, there's a label \\"x\\" near CD, which suggests that CD is the side we're solving for. So, yes, CD is 10*sqrt(2). I think that's the answer.Just to make sure, let me recap:1. In triangle ABD (15-75-90), AD = 10 (opposite 15°), so AB = 10 * tan(15°) = 10*(2 - sqrt(3)).2. In triangle ACD (45-45-90), AD = 10 (leg), so CD = 10*sqrt(2).Yes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, CD is 10*sqrt(2)."},{"question":"A bus ticket is considered to be lucky if the sum of the first three digits equals to the sum of the last three ( 6  digits in Russian buses). Prove that the sum of all the lucky numbers is divisible by  13 .","answer":"Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of all lucky bus ticket numbers is divisible by 13. A lucky ticket is defined as a six-digit number where the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in Russian buses, tickets are six digits, and people often talk about lucky tickets because of this property. But I need to think about how to approach proving something about the sum of all such numbers.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A lucky ticket is a six-digit number, say, ABCDEF, where A+B+C = D+E+F. So, for example, 123321 is a lucky ticket because 1+2+3 = 3+2+1 = 6. Now, I need to consider all such possible six-digit numbers and show that when you add them all together, the total sum is divisible by 13.Alright, so maybe I should start by thinking about how many lucky tickets there are. But wait, that might not be necessary. The problem isn't asking for the number of lucky tickets, just the sum of all their values. So, perhaps I need a way to represent all these numbers and find a pattern or a property that makes their sum divisible by 13.Let me think about the structure of a six-digit number. It can be written as 100000*A + 10000*B + 1000*C + 100*D + 10*E + F. So, each digit contributes to the number based on its position. Now, for a lucky ticket, we have A+B+C = D+E+F. Maybe I can use this condition to relate the digits in some way that helps me sum all the numbers.I wonder if there's a symmetry or some kind of pairing that can be used here. For example, if I take a ticket ABCDEF, is there another ticket that relates to it in a way that their sum has a nice property? Maybe something like swapping the first three digits with the last three? So, ABCDEF and DEFABC. Let me check if both of these are lucky tickets.If ABCDEF is a lucky ticket, then A+B+C = D+E+F. If I swap the first three and last three digits, I get DEFABC. Now, for DEFABC to be a lucky ticket, we need D+E+F = A+B+C, which is the same as the original condition. So, yes, if ABCDEF is lucky, then DEFABC is also lucky. That seems useful.So, if I pair each lucky ticket with its \\"swapped\\" version, I can consider their sum. Let's compute the sum of ABCDEF and DEFABC:ABCDEF + DEFABC = (100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + F) + (100000D + 10000E + 1000F + 100A + 10B + C)Let me simplify this expression:= 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + F + 100000D + 10000E + 1000F + 100A + 10B + CNow, let's group like terms:= (100000A + 100A) + (10000B + 10B) + (1000C + C) + (100D + 100000D) + (10E + 10000E) + (F + 1000F)= 100100A + 10010B + 1001C + 100100D + 10010E + 1001FHmm, interesting. So, each pair of digits contributes a multiple of 1001, 10010, or 100100. I notice that 1001 is a multiple of 13 because 1001 divided by 13 is 77. Let me verify that:13 * 77 = 1001. Yes, that's correct. So, 1001 is divisible by 13. Similarly, 10010 is 1001 * 10, which is also divisible by 13, and 100100 is 1001 * 100, which is divisible by 13 as well.Therefore, each term in the sum ABCDEF + DEFABC is divisible by 13. That means the entire sum of each pair is divisible by 13. If I can show that the total sum of all lucky tickets is just the sum of these pairs, then the total sum would also be divisible by 13.But wait, is every lucky ticket part of such a pair? If I take a lucky ticket, say, ABCDEF, and swap the first three and last three digits to get DEFABC, is DEFABC necessarily different from ABCDEF? Not always. For example, if A=D, B=E, and C=F, then ABCDEF and DEFABC are the same number. So, in that case, the number is a palindrome, and it doesn't form a distinct pair.Hmm, so I need to be careful about palindromic lucky tickets. These would only contribute once to the total sum, whereas the other tickets contribute in pairs. So, perhaps I should separate the sum into two parts: the sum of all palindromic lucky tickets and the sum of all non-palindromic lucky tickets, which can be paired as ABCDEF and DEFABC.But wait, if I consider the sum of all lucky tickets, including palindromic ones, and if the non-palindromic ones can be grouped into pairs whose sums are divisible by 13, then the total sum would be the sum of these pairs plus the sum of the palindromic tickets. So, if I can show that the sum of the palindromic tickets is also divisible by 13, then the entire sum would be divisible by 13.Alternatively, maybe the sum of the palindromic tickets is zero modulo 13, or perhaps their contribution is also a multiple of 13. Let me think about that.A palindromic ticket satisfies A=D, B=E, and C=F. So, such a ticket can be written as ABC CBA. The sum of its digits is A+B+C = C+B+A, which is trivially true, so all palindromic six-digit numbers are lucky tickets. Now, how many palindromic tickets are there? Well, the first three digits can be any combination from 000 to 999, and the last three digits are determined by the first three. So, there are 1000 palindromic tickets.But I don't know if that helps me directly. Maybe I can think about the sum of all palindromic tickets. Let's denote a palindromic ticket as ABC CBA. Its value is 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100C + 10B + A = 100001A + 10010B + 1100C.So, the sum of all palindromic tickets would be the sum over all A, B, C of (100001A + 10010B + 1100C). Let's compute this sum.First, let's consider the sum over A, B, C of 100001A. Since A ranges from 0 to 9, and B and C range from 0 to 9 as well, the sum would be 100001 * (sum of A from 0 to 9) * (number of B and C combinations). The sum of A from 0 to 9 is 45, and there are 10 choices for B and 10 for C, so 100 combinations. Therefore, the sum is 100001 * 45 * 100.Similarly, the sum over all B is 10010 * (sum of B from 0 to 9) * (number of A and C combinations). Again, sum of B is 45, and number of A and C combinations is 100. So, this sum is 10010 * 45 * 100.Finally, the sum over all C is 1100 * (sum of C from 0 to 9) * (number of A and B combinations). Sum of C is 45, and number of A and B combinations is 100. So, this sum is 1100 * 45 * 100.Now, let's compute these:1. 100001 * 45 * 100 = 100001 * 45002. 10010 * 45 * 100 = 10010 * 45003. 1100 * 45 * 100 = 1100 * 4500Let me compute each term modulo 13 to see if they are divisible by 13.First, 100001 modulo 13. Let's compute 100001 divided by 13. 13*7692 = 99996, so 100001 - 99996 = 5. So, 100001 ≡ 5 mod 13.Similarly, 10010 divided by 13: 13*770 = 10010, so 10010 ≡ 0 mod 13.And 1100 divided by 13: 13*84 = 1092, so 1100 - 1092 = 8. So, 1100 ≡ 8 mod 13.Now, let's compute each term modulo 13:1. 100001 * 4500 ≡ 5 * (4500 mod 13) mod 132. 10010 * 4500 ≡ 0 * (4500 mod 13) ≡ 0 mod 133. 1100 * 4500 ≡ 8 * (4500 mod 13) mod 13Now, let's compute 4500 mod 13. 13*346 = 4498, so 4500 - 4498 = 2. Therefore, 4500 ≡ 2 mod 13.So, updating the terms:1. 5 * 2 = 10 mod 132. 0 mod 133. 8 * 2 = 16 ≡ 3 mod 13Adding these up: 10 + 0 + 3 = 13 ≡ 0 mod 13.Wow, so the sum of all palindromic lucky tickets is congruent to 0 modulo 13. That means it's divisible by 13.Earlier, I saw that the sum of each pair of non-palindromic lucky tickets is divisible by 13. So, combining these two results, the total sum of all lucky tickets (both palindromic and non-palindromic) is divisible by 13.Therefore, the sum of all lucky numbers is divisible by 13."},{"question":"What is the maximum number of consecutive positive integers starting from 3 that can be added together before the sum exceeds 500?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the maximum number of consecutive positive integers starting from 3 that can be added together before the sum exceeds 500. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that consecutive positive integers starting from 3 would be 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. I need to add these numbers one by one until the total is just below 500. The question is, how many numbers can I add before I hit or exceed 500?I remember there's a formula for the sum of consecutive integers. It's something like the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. Let me recall the exact formula. Oh yeah, it's S = n/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 3, and the last term would be 3 + (n - 1), since we're starting at 3 and adding n terms.So, substituting the values, the sum S would be n/2 * (3 + (3 + n - 1)). Let me simplify that. 3 + (3 + n - 1) is 3 + 3 + n - 1, which is 5 + n. So, S = n/2 * (n + 5). That makes sense.Now, I need this sum S to be less than 500. So, I can set up the inequality: n/2 * (n + 5) < 500. Let me write that down:n(n + 5)/2 < 500To make it easier, I'll multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:n(n + 5) < 1000Expanding the left side:n² + 5n < 1000Now, I can rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality:n² + 5n - 1000 < 0To solve this inequality, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation n² + 5n - 1000 = 0. I'll use the quadratic formula for that. The quadratic formula is:n = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)In this equation, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -1000. Plugging these values in:n = [-5 ± √(25 + 4000)] / 2Wait, because b² is 25 and 4ac is 4*1*(-1000) which is -4000. So, the discriminant becomes:√(25 + 4000) = √4025Hmm, what's the square root of 4025? Let me estimate. I know that 63² is 3969 and 64² is 4096. So, √4025 is between 63 and 64. Let me calculate 63.5² to see if that's close:63.5² = (63 + 0.5)² = 63² + 2*63*0.5 + 0.5² = 3969 + 63 + 0.25 = 4032.25Oh, that's just a bit over 4025. So, √4025 is approximately 63.48. Let's say approximately 63.5 for simplicity.So, n = [-5 ± 63.5] / 2We can ignore the negative root because the number of terms can't be negative. So, we take the positive root:n = (-5 + 63.5) / 2 = 58.5 / 2 = 29.25Since n has to be an integer, we take the floor of 29.25, which is 29. So, n = 29.But wait, I should verify this. Let me calculate the sum when n = 29:S = 29/2 * (3 + (3 + 29 - 1)) = 29/2 * (3 + 31) = 29/2 * 34 = 29 * 17 = 493Okay, 493 is less than 500. What about n = 30?S = 30/2 * (3 + (3 + 30 - 1)) = 15 * (3 + 32) = 15 * 35 = 525525 is more than 500, so n = 30 is too big. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 3 that can be added without exceeding 500 is 29.Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculations. For n = 29:First term = 3, last term = 3 + 29 - 1 = 31Sum = 29*(3 + 31)/2 = 29*34/2 = 29*17 = 493. Yep, that's correct.For n = 30:First term = 3, last term = 3 + 30 - 1 = 32Sum = 30*(3 + 32)/2 = 30*35/2 = 15*35 = 525. That's also correct.So, 29 terms give a sum of 493, which is under 500, and 30 terms give 525, which is over. Therefore, the answer is 29.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It all checks out."},{"question":"Suppose functions g and f have the properties that g(x)=3f^{-1}(x) and f(x)=frac{18}{x+2}. For what value of x does g(x)=18?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of x for which g(x) equals 18. The functions g and f are related in a specific way: g(x) is equal to 3 times the inverse of f evaluated at x, and f(x) is given as 18 divided by (x plus 2). Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x). So, if g(x) is 18, then 3 times the inverse function of f at x is 18. That means I can set up the equation 3f^{-1}(x) = 18. To solve for f^{-1}(x), I can divide both sides by 3, which gives me f^{-1}(x) = 6. Okay, so the inverse function of f at x is 6. Now, since f^{-1}(x) = 6, that means that f(6) must equal x. Because inverse functions essentially reverse each other, right? If f^{-1}(x) = 6, then applying f to both sides gives f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(6), which simplifies to x = f(6). So, I need to find f(6).Given that f(x) = 18 / (x + 2), I can substitute 6 into this function. Let me write that out: f(6) = 18 / (6 + 2). Simplifying the denominator, 6 + 2 is 8, so f(6) = 18 / 8. Wait, 18 divided by 8 can be simplified further. Both 18 and 8 are divisible by 2, so dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives me 9/4. So, f(6) is 9/4, which means x is 9/4.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from g(x) = 18, I substituted the given relationship g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) to get 3f^{-1}(x) = 18. Dividing both sides by 3 gives f^{-1}(x) = 6. Since f and f^{-1} are inverses, f(6) should equal x. Plugging 6 into f(x) gives 18 / (6 + 2) = 18/8 = 9/4. Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The key steps were understanding the relationship between g and f inverse, then using the definition of inverse functions to find x by evaluating f at 6. I guess another way to think about it is if f maps 6 to x, then f^{-1} maps x back to 6. So, when g(x) is 18, it's essentially telling me that f^{-1}(x) is 6, which directly relates x to f(6). Just to make sure, maybe I can verify by plugging x = 9/4 back into g(x) and see if it equals 18. Let's try that. First, find f^{-1}(9/4). Since f(6) = 9/4, as we found earlier, then f^{-1}(9/4) must be 6. Therefore, g(9/4) = 3 * f^{-1}(9/4) = 3 * 6 = 18. Yep, that works out. So, I'm confident that x = 9/4 is the correct answer."},{"question":"the length of a rectangular plot is thrice its breadth . if the area of the rectangular plot is 972 sq m , then what is the breadth of the rectangular plot ?","answer":"First, let's denote the breadth of the rectangular plot as ( b ) meters. Since the length is three times the breadth, the length can be expressed as ( 3b ) meters.The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its breadth. Given that the area of the plot is 972 square meters, we can set up the equation:[ 3b times b = 972 ]Simplifying this equation:[ 3b^2 = 972 ]To find the value of ( b ), divide both sides of the equation by 3:[ b^2 = frac{972}{3} ][ b^2 = 324 ]Taking the square root of both sides gives:[ b = sqrt{324} ][ b = 18 ]Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular plot is 18 meters."},{"question":"Triangle PQR has side lengths PQ=7, QR=8, and RP=9. Two bugs start simultaneously from P and crawl along the perimeter of the triangle in opposite directions at the same speed. They meet at point S. What is QS?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a triangle PQR with sides PQ=7, QR=8, and RP=9. Two bugs start crawling from point P at the same time, but in opposite directions around the perimeter of the triangle. They meet at some point S, and I need to figure out the length of QS. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First off, I know that when two objects move in opposite directions around a closed path, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Since both bugs start at the same time and move at the same speed, they should meet each other after each has crawled half the perimeter of the triangle. That makes sense because if they were moving towards each other, they'd cover the entire perimeter together by the time they meet.So, let me calculate the perimeter of triangle PQR. The sides are 7, 8, and 9, so adding those up: 7 + 8 + 9 equals 24. Okay, so the perimeter is 24 units. That means each bug will crawl half of that, which is 12 units, before they meet. Got it.Now, I need to figure out where they meet. Since they start at point P and go in opposite directions, one bug will go along PQ and then QR, while the other will go along PR and then RP. Wait, no, actually, the triangle is PQR, so the sides are PQ, QR, and RP. So, one bug will go from P to Q to R, and the other will go from P to R to Q. They meet somewhere along the perimeter.Let me visualize the triangle. Let's say P is the starting point. One bug goes clockwise: P to Q to R. The other goes counterclockwise: P to R to Q. They meet at point S somewhere on the perimeter. I need to find QS, which is the distance from Q to S.Since both bugs crawl 12 units before meeting, I can figure out how far each bug has gone along their respective paths. Let's consider the bug going clockwise first. Starting from P, it goes along PQ, which is 7 units. Then, it continues along QR. So, the total distance it crawls is 7 + QS = 12 units. Therefore, QS must be 12 - 7, which is 5 units. So, QS is 5 units long.Wait, let me double-check that. If the bug goes from P to Q, that's 7 units, and then from Q to S, which is 5 units, totaling 12 units. The other bug goes counterclockwise from P to R, which is 9 units, and then from R to S. Let me see, the total distance for the other bug is also 12 units, so from R to S would be 12 - 9 = 3 units. That means S is 3 units away from R along the side QR. Since QR is 8 units long, and S is 3 units away from R, then QS would be QR - RS, which is 8 - 3 = 5 units. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.So, both bugs meet at point S, which is 5 units away from Q along side QR. Therefore, the length of QS is 5 units.I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The perimeter is 24, so each bug crawls 12 units. The bug going clockwise from P covers PQ (7 units) and then some distance on QR, which is 5 units, totaling 12. The other bug going counterclockwise covers PR (9 units) and then some distance on QR, which is 3 units, also totaling 12. Since QR is 8 units, 5 units from Q and 3 units from R add up to 8, so that checks out.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that each bug crawls half the perimeter before meeting, and then figuring out how far along their respective paths they go. Both paths lead to the same conclusion about the position of S relative to Q and R. So, I'm pretty confident that QS is 5 units long.**Final Answer**boxed{5}"},{"question":"In triangle ABC, a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. It is known that angle A is acute, and b=3asin B. Find tan A= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle ABC, and the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. It's given that angle A is acute, which means it's less than 90 degrees. Also, I know that b equals 3a times the sine of angle B. I need to find the tangent of angle A.Hmm, let me think. I remember the Law of Sines, which says that in any triangle, the ratio of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, that would mean a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Maybe I can use that here.Given that b = 3a sin B, I can substitute b in the Law of Sines equation. So, from the Law of Sines, b/sin B = a/sin A. Plugging in the given value of b, I get (3a sin B)/sin B = a/sin A. Wait, the sin B terms cancel out, so that simplifies to 3a = a/sin A.Hmm, okay, so 3a equals a divided by sin A. Let me write that down: 3a = a / sin A. If I divide both sides by a (assuming a is not zero, which it can't be in a triangle), I get 3 = 1 / sin A. So, sin A = 1/3.Alright, so sin A is 1/3. Since angle A is acute, I can find cos A using the Pythagorean identity, which is sin² A + cos² A = 1. Plugging in sin A, I get (1/3)² + cos² A = 1, so 1/9 + cos² A = 1. Subtracting 1/9 from both sides, cos² A = 8/9. Taking the square root, cos A = sqrt(8/9) = 2√2 / 3.Now, tan A is sin A divided by cos A, so tan A = (1/3) / (2√2 / 3). The 3s cancel out, so tan A = 1 / (2√2). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2, which gives tan A = √2 / 4.Let me double-check my steps. I used the Law of Sines correctly, substituted the given equation, canceled out sin B, solved for sin A, then found cos A using the identity, and finally calculated tan A. Everything seems to add up. So, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**The value of tan A is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{4}}."},{"question":"What number must be added to both the numerator and denominator of frac{4}{7} so that the resulting fraction equals frac{6}{7}?","answer":"Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to figure out what number I should add to both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction 4/7 so that the new fraction equals 6/7. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's understand what the problem is asking. I have the fraction 4/7, and I need to add the same number, let's call it 'n', to both the top (numerator) and the bottom (denominator) of this fraction. After adding 'n' to both, the resulting fraction should be equal to 6/7. So, essentially, I need to find the value of 'n' that makes this equation true: (4 + n)/(7 + n) = 6/7.Alright, so I need to solve for 'n' in this equation. Let's write that equation down again to make sure I have it right:(4 + n)/(7 + n) = 6/7Okay, now that I have the equation, I need to solve for 'n'. To do this, I can use cross-multiplication because it's an equation involving fractions. Cross-multiplication means I'll multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction and set them equal to each other. So, multiplying 4 + n by 7 and 7 + n by 6.Let's do that step by step:(4 + n) * 7 = (7 + n) * 6Now, let's carry out the multiplication on both sides.Starting with the left side: (4 + n) * 7I can distribute the 7 across both terms inside the parentheses:4 * 7 + n * 7 = 28 + 7nOkay, so the left side simplifies to 28 + 7n.Now, the right side: (7 + n) * 6Similarly, I'll distribute the 6 across both terms inside the parentheses:7 * 6 + n * 6 = 42 + 6nSo, the right side simplifies to 42 + 6n.Now, putting it all together, the equation becomes:28 + 7n = 42 + 6nAlright, now I have a linear equation in terms of 'n'. I need to solve for 'n'. Let's get all the terms containing 'n' on one side and the constant terms on the other side.First, I'll subtract 6n from both sides to get rid of the 6n on the right side:28 + 7n - 6n = 42 + 6n - 6nSimplifying both sides:28 + n = 42Now, I need to isolate 'n'. I'll subtract 28 from both sides to get 'n' by itself:28 + n - 28 = 42 - 28Simplifying:n = 14So, the value of 'n' that needs to be added to both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction 4/7 to make it equal to 6/7 is 14.Wait a second, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mix up signs or coefficients when dealing with algebraic equations.Starting again, the original equation is:(4 + n)/(7 + n) = 6/7Cross-multiplying gives:7*(4 + n) = 6*(7 + n)Expanding both sides:28 + 7n = 42 + 6nSubtracting 6n from both sides:28 + n = 42Subtracting 28 from both sides:n = 14Yep, that checks out. So, adding 14 to both the numerator and the denominator of 4/7 gives:(4 + 14)/(7 + 14) = 18/21Simplifying 18/21 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:18 ÷ 3 = 621 ÷ 3 = 7So, 18/21 simplifies to 6/7, which is exactly what we wanted. Therefore, my solution is correct.I think I've got it. The number to add is 14. It makes sense because when you add 14 to both 4 and 7, you get 18 and 21, which simplifies back down to 6/7. That's the fraction we were aiming for. So, no mistakes here, I'm confident with this answer."},{"question":"List F consists of 12 consecutive integers.

The indices {a, b, c, d} are just a permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4}, so I need to consider all possible pairings of the roots and find the minimum absolute value of the sum of two products.First, I think I need to find the roots of the polynomial g(x). Maybe factoring it would help. Let me try to factor g(x). It's a quartic polynomial, so perhaps it can be factored into quadratics or maybe even linear terms.Looking at the polynomial: x^4 + 10x^3 + 35x^2 + 50x + 24. I notice that the coefficients are all positive except for the x^3 term, which is positive as well. Wait, no, actually, all coefficients are positive. Hmm, that might not help much. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 24 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24.Let me test x = -1: Plugging in, (-1)^4 + 10*(-1)^3 + 35*(-1)^2 + 50*(-1) + 24 = 1 - 10 + 35 - 50 + 24. Let's compute that: 1 -10 is -9, -9 +35 is 26, 26 -50 is -24, -24 +24 is 0. So x = -1 is a root. Great, so (x + 1) is a factor.Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x + 1). Let's do synthetic division with root -1.Coefficients: 1 (x^4), 10 (x^3), 35 (x^2), 50 (x), 24 (constant).Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next coefficient: 10 + (-1) = 9.Multiply 9 by -1: -9. Add to next coefficient: 35 + (-9) = 26.Multiply 26 by -1: -26. Add to next coefficient: 50 + (-26) = 24.Multiply 24 by -1: -24. Add to last coefficient: 24 + (-24) = 0. Perfect.So after factoring out (x + 1), we have the cubic polynomial x^3 + 9x^2 + 26x + 24.Now, let's factor this cubic. Again, possible rational roots are factors of 24: ±1, ±2, ±3, etc.Testing x = -2: (-2)^3 + 9*(-2)^2 + 26*(-2) + 24 = -8 + 36 - 52 + 24. Compute: -8 +36=28, 28 -52=-24, -24 +24=0. So x = -2 is a root. Therefore, (x + 2) is a factor.Performing synthetic division on the cubic with root -2:Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 9 (x^2), 26 (x), 24.Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 9 + (-2) = 7.Multiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to next coefficient: 26 + (-14) = 12.Multiply 12 by -2: -24. Add to last coefficient: 24 + (-24) = 0.So after factoring out (x + 2), we have the quadratic x^2 + 7x + 12.Now, factor this quadratic: x^2 + 7x + 12. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. That would be 3 and 4. So, (x + 3)(x + 4).Putting it all together, the polynomial factors as (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4). Therefore, the roots are w1 = -1, w2 = -2, w3 = -3, w4 = -4.Wait, but hold on, in the initial problem, it's given as w1, w2, w3, w4, but the polynomial is x^4 + 10x^3 + 35x^2 + 50x + 24, which factors as (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4). So yes, the roots are -1, -2, -3, -4.So now, I have the roots: -1, -2, -3, -4. I need to compute |w_a w_b + w_c w_d| for all possible pairings and find the smallest value.Since the roots are all negative, their products will be positive. So, the absolute value is just the value itself, since it's positive.So, let's list all possible pairings:1. Pair (-1, -2) and (-3, -4): Compute (-1)(-2) + (-3)(-4) = 2 + 12 = 142. Pair (-1, -3) and (-2, -4): Compute (-1)(-3) + (-2)(-4) = 3 + 8 = 113. Pair (-1, -4) and (-2, -3): Compute (-1)(-4) + (-2)(-3) = 4 + 6 = 10Wait, so the possible sums are 14, 11, and 10. So the smallest is 10.But hold on, is that all? Or are there more pairings? Let me think.Wait, actually, for four elements, the number of ways to partition into two pairs is 3, which I have considered above. So, the possible pairings are indeed 3, and the minimal sum is 10.But wait, the problem says |w_a w_b + w_c w_d|. So, in the first case, it's 2 + 12 = 14, second is 3 + 8 = 11, third is 4 + 6 = 10. So, the minimal is 10.But hold on, let me double-check. Maybe I missed some pairing? Or perhaps considering different groupings.Wait, another thought: maybe if I pair differently, but since all pairings are considered, I think 10 is indeed the minimal.But wait, hold on, the problem says \\"the smallest possible value of |w_a w_b + w_c w_d|\\". So, 10 is the minimal. But let me think again.Wait, another approach: using Vieta's formula. The polynomial is (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4). So, the roots are -1, -2, -3, -4.So, the products of roots two at a time: Let's compute all possible products:w1*w2 = (-1)*(-2) = 2w1*w3 = (-1)*(-3) = 3w1*w4 = (-1)*(-4) = 4w2*w3 = (-2)*(-3) = 6w2*w4 = (-2)*(-4) = 8w3*w4 = (-3)*(-4) = 12So, the products are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.Now, we need to pair these products into two pairs such that the sum of each pair is as small as possible. Wait, no, actually, the problem is to pair the roots into two pairs, compute the product of each pair, and then take the sum of those two products, and find the minimal absolute value.So, for example, pairing (-1, -2) and (-3, -4) gives products 2 and 12, sum is 14.Pairing (-1, -3) and (-2, -4) gives products 3 and 8, sum is 11.Pairing (-1, -4) and (-2, -3) gives products 4 and 6, sum is 10.So, indeed, the minimal is 10.But wait, let me think again. Is 10 the minimal? Or is there a way to get a smaller sum?Wait, another thought: perhaps if we consider different pairings, but since all pairings are considered, I think 10 is the minimal.Alternatively, maybe using Vieta's formula, we can find the sum of products.Wait, Vieta's formula for quartic: x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d.Sum of roots: -a = -10Sum of products two at a time: b = 35Sum of products three at a time: -c = -50Product of all roots: d = 24But how does this help? Maybe not directly, but perhaps considering that the sum of products two at a time is 35, which is the sum of all possible products: 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 35. So that checks out.But we need to find the minimal sum of two products, each product being a pair of roots. So, as above, the minimal is 10.Wait, but in the initial problem, the polynomial was given as x^4 +10x^3 +35x^2 +50x +24, which we factored as (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4). So, the roots are -1, -2, -3, -4.So, the products are as I computed: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.So, the minimal sum is 4 + 6 = 10.Therefore, the minimal |w_a w_b + w_c w_d| is 10.But wait, hold on, in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"Let g(x)=x^4+10x^3+35x^2+50x+24. Let w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 be the four roots of g. Find the smallest possible value of |w_{a}w_{b}+w_{c}w_{d}| where {a,b,c,d}={1,2,3,4}.\\"So, the minimal value is 10.But wait, in the initial assistant's answer, it was 24. That seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.Wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"Let g(x)=x^4+10x^3+35x^2+50x+24. Let w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 be the four roots of g. Find the smallest possible value of |w_{a}w_{b}+w_{c}w_{d}| where {a,b,c,d}={1,2,3,4}.\\"But in the initial assistant's answer, it was concluded that the minimal value is 24. But according to my calculation, it's 10.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pairing.Wait, let me think again. The roots are -1, -2, -3, -4.So, pairing (-1, -4) and (-2, -3):(-1)*(-4) = 4(-2)*(-3) = 6Sum: 4 + 6 = 10.Alternatively, pairing (-1, -3) and (-2, -4):(-1)*(-3) = 3(-2)*(-4) = 8Sum: 3 + 8 = 11.Pairing (-1, -2) and (-3, -4):(-1)*(-2) = 2(-3)*(-4) = 12Sum: 2 + 12 = 14.So, the minimal is indeed 10.But in the initial assistant's answer, it was 24. That seems incorrect.Wait, perhaps the assistant made a mistake in the initial thought process.Wait, looking back, the initial assistant wrote:\\"First, note that[frac{1}{24}g(2x) = x^4 + frac{5}{3}x^3 + frac{35}{12}x^2 + frac{25}{6}x + 1.]This transformed polynomial also has symmetric coefficients, implying that if r is a root of g(x), then frac{12}{r} is also a root.Now, evaluating g(-1) and g(-3):[g(-1) = 1^4 - 10 cdot 1^3 + 35 cdot 1^2 - 50 cdot 1 + 24 = 0,][g(-3) = (-3)^4 + 10 cdot (-3)^3 + 35 cdot (-3)^2 + 50 cdot (-3) + 24 = 0.]So -1 and -3 are roots. Using the symmetry in the coefficients, -frac{12}{-1} = 12 and -frac{12}{-3} = 4 are also roots.Then, we consider permutations of {1,2,3,4}:[|w_{sigma(1)} w_{sigma(2)} + w_{sigma(3)} w_{sigma(4)}| leq frac{1}{2} (w_{sigma(1)} w_{sigma(2)} + w_{sigma(3)} w_{sigma(4)} + w_{sigma(4)} w_{sigma(3)} + w_{sigma(2)} w_{sigma(1)}).]Let the roots be ordered w_1 le w_2 le w_3 le w_4, then by rearrangement the last expression is at least:[frac{1}{2}(w_1w_4+w_2w_3+w_3w_2+w_4w_1).]Since the roots come in pairs w_1w_4=w_2w_3=12, our expression is minimized when sigma(1)=1,sigma(2)=4,sigma(3)=3,sigma(4)=2 and its minimum value is boxed{24}.\\"Wait, but according to this, the roots are -1, -3, 4, 12. But that's not correct because when I factored the polynomial, I got roots at -1, -2, -3, -4.So, perhaps the initial assistant made a mistake in assuming the roots are -1, -3, 4, 12, which is incorrect.Wait, let's check g(-1): (-1)^4 +10*(-1)^3 +35*(-1)^2 +50*(-1) +24 = 1 -10 +35 -50 +24 = 0. Correct.g(-3): (-3)^4 +10*(-3)^3 +35*(-3)^2 +50*(-3) +24 = 81 -270 + 315 -150 +24 = 81 -270 is -189, -189 +315 is 126, 126 -150 is -24, -24 +24 is 0. Correct.But then, the assistant says that using the symmetry, 12 and 4 are roots. Wait, but g(12) would be a huge number, not zero. Similarly, g(4) is 256 + 640 + 560 + 200 +24, which is way larger than zero. So, 4 and 12 are not roots.So, the assistant made a mistake in assuming that the transformed polynomial has symmetric coefficients, leading to reciprocal roots, but that's not the case here.Therefore, the correct roots are -1, -2, -3, -4, and the minimal |w_a w_b + w_c w_d| is 10.Therefore, the initial assistant's answer of 24 is incorrect, and the correct answer is 10.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, the initial assistant transformed the polynomial by substituting 2x, but perhaps that's unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe the polynomial has reciprocal roots, but in this case, it's not the case.Alternatively, perhaps the assistant confused the polynomial with another one.In any case, based on factoring, the roots are -1, -2, -3, -4, and the minimal sum of products is 10.Therefore, the answer should be 10.But wait, let me check the initial problem again. It says \\"Find the smallest possible value of |w_a w_b + w_c w_d|\\".So, if the roots are -1, -2, -3, -4, then the products are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.So, the possible sums are:2 + 12 = 143 + 8 = 114 + 6 = 10So, 10 is the minimal.Therefore, the answer is 10.But in the initial assistant's answer, it was 24, which is incorrect.Therefore, the correct answer is 10.But wait, let me think again. Maybe the assistant was considering the products of roots in a different way.Wait, in the initial assistant's answer, it was considering the products as 12 each, but that's not the case.Wait, perhaps the assistant thought that the roots come in reciprocal pairs, but that's not the case here.In conclusion, the correct minimal value is 10."},{"question":"How many even integers n, such that 25 <= n <= 350, are of the form 5k + 7, where k is any natural number?","answer":"First, I need to identify the even integers ( n ) within the range ( 25 leq n leq 350 ) that can be expressed in the form ( 5k + 7 ), where ( k ) is a natural number.To find the smallest value of ( k ) such that ( n geq 25 ):[5k + 7 geq 25 5k geq 18 k geq frac{18}{5} = 3.6]Since ( k ) must be a natural number, the smallest ( k ) is 4.Next, to find the largest value of ( k ) such that ( n leq 350 ):[5k + 7 leq 350 5k leq 343 k leq frac{343}{5} = 68.6]Thus, the largest ( k ) is 68.Now, I need to determine which values of ( k ) result in an even ( n ). Since ( 5k ) is always odd (because 5 is odd), adding 7 (which is also odd) results in an even number. Therefore, ( k ) must be even for ( n ) to be even.The even values of ( k ) between 4 and 68 are: 4, 6, 8, ..., 68. This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 4 ), common difference ( d = 2 ), and last term ( l = 68 ).To find the number of terms ( n ) in this sequence:[l = a + (n - 1)d 68 = 4 + (n - 1) times 2 68 - 4 = 2(n - 1) 64 = 2(n - 1) n - 1 = 32 n = 33]Therefore, there are 33 even integers ( n ) of the form ( 5k + 7 ) within the specified range."},{"question":"Let alpha and beta be real numbers. Find the minimum value of:[(3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta - 7)^2 + (3 sin alpha + 4 cos beta - 12)^2.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the expression:[(3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta - 7)^2 + (3 sin alpha + 4 cos beta - 12)^2.]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down. Let me try to understand what's going on here. It seems like there are two variables, (alpha) and (beta), which are angles, and they're involved in trigonometric functions. The expression is the sum of squares, which reminds me of the distance formula in coordinate geometry. Maybe I can interpret this as the squared distance between two points?Let me denote:[x = 3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta]and[y = 3 sin alpha + 4 cos beta.]So, the expression becomes:[(x - 7)^2 + (y - 12)^2.]That's the squared distance from the point ((x, y)) to the point ((7, 12)). So, I need to find the minimum value of this distance squared. To minimize this, I need to find the point ((x, y)) that is closest to ((7, 12)), given the definitions of (x) and (y) in terms of (alpha) and (beta).Now, let's think about the possible values of (x) and (y). Since (cos) and (sin) functions have outputs between -1 and 1, the terms (3 cos alpha) and (3 sin alpha) will vary between -3 and 3. Similarly, (4 sin beta) and (4 cos beta) will vary between -4 and 4. So, (x) can range from (3 times (-1) + 4 times (-1) = -7) to (3 times 1 + 4 times 1 = 7). Similarly, (y) can range from (-7) to (7). Wait, is that correct?Wait, actually, (x = 3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta). So, the maximum value of (x) would be when both (cos alpha) and (sin beta) are 1, so (3 + 4 = 7). Similarly, the minimum would be when both are -1, so (-3 -4 = -7). Same for (y). So, (x) and (y) each can range from -7 to 7. So, the point ((x, y)) lies within a square with corners at ((-7, -7)), ((-7, 7)), ((7, -7)), and ((7, 7)).But the point ((7, 12)) is outside this square. So, the closest point on the square to ((7, 12)) would be the corner ((7, 7)), right? Because ((7, 12)) is above the square, so the closest point is the top-right corner of the square.So, the distance squared from ((7, 12)) to ((7, 7)) is ((7 - 7)^2 + (12 - 7)^2 = 0 + 25 = 25). So, the minimum value would be 25? But wait, is that the case?Wait, hold on. Maybe I oversimplified. Because (x) and (y) are not independent variables. They are related through (alpha) and (beta). So, just because (x) and (y) can each range from -7 to 7 doesn't mean that all points within that square are achievable. There might be some constraints because (x) and (y) are defined in terms of the same angles (alpha) and (beta).Let me think about this more carefully. Maybe I can express (x) and (y) in terms of vectors or something. Let me try to compute (x^2 + y^2):[x^2 + y^2 = (3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta)^2 + (3 sin alpha + 4 cos beta)^2.]Expanding both squares:[x^2 = 9 cos^2 alpha + 24 cos alpha sin beta + 16 sin^2 beta,][y^2 = 9 sin^2 alpha + 24 sin alpha cos beta + 16 cos^2 beta.]Adding them together:[x^2 + y^2 = 9 (cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha) + 16 (sin^2 beta + cos^2 beta) + 24 (cos alpha sin beta + sin alpha cos beta).]Simplifying using the Pythagorean identity (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta = 1):[x^2 + y^2 = 9(1) + 16(1) + 24 (cos alpha sin beta + sin alpha cos beta).][x^2 + y^2 = 25 + 24 (sin(alpha + beta)).]Wait, because (cos alpha sin beta + sin alpha cos beta = sin(alpha + beta)). That's a trigonometric identity. So, we have:[x^2 + y^2 = 25 + 24 sin(alpha + beta).]Since (sin(alpha + beta)) ranges between -1 and 1, the maximum value of (x^2 + y^2) is (25 + 24(1) = 49), and the minimum is (25 + 24(-1) = 1). So, (x^2 + y^2) can range from 1 to 49.Hmm, so the point ((x, y)) lies on a circle with radius between 1 and 7. So, the set of possible points ((x, y)) is not a square but an annulus (a ring-shaped region) with inner radius 1 and outer radius 7. So, my initial thought that it was a square was incorrect.Therefore, the point ((x, y)) can be anywhere within or on the boundary of this annulus. Now, the point ((7, 12)) is outside this annulus. So, the minimum distance from ((7, 12)) to any point on the annulus would be the distance from ((7, 12)) to the center of the annulus minus the maximum radius of the annulus.Wait, the annulus is centered at the origin, right? Because (x) and (y) are defined as combinations of (cos) and (sin) terms, which are centered around 0. So, the annulus is centered at (0, 0), with inner radius 1 and outer radius 7.So, the distance from the origin to the point ((7, 12)) is:[sqrt{7^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{49 + 144} = sqrt{193} approx 13.89.]So, the distance from the origin to ((7, 12)) is about 13.89, which is much larger than the outer radius of the annulus, which is 7. Therefore, the closest point on the annulus to ((7, 12)) would be along the line connecting the origin to ((7, 12)), but only as far as the outer radius of the annulus allows.So, the minimum distance from ((7, 12)) to any point on the annulus is:[sqrt{193} - 7.]Therefore, the minimum value of the expression ((x - 7)^2 + (y - 12)^2) is:[(sqrt{193} - 7)^2.]Let me compute that:[(sqrt{193} - 7)^2 = (sqrt{193})^2 - 2 times 7 times sqrt{193} + 7^2 = 193 - 14sqrt{193} + 49 = 242 - 14sqrt{193}.]So, the minimum value is (242 - 14sqrt{193}).Wait, but let me double-check. Is the closest point on the annulus along the line connecting the origin to ((7, 12))? Because the annulus is centered at the origin, and the point ((7, 12)) is outside the annulus, the closest point on the annulus should indeed lie along the line from the origin to ((7, 12)), at a distance of 7 from the origin.So, the point on the annulus closest to ((7, 12)) is in the direction of ((7, 12)), scaled to have a length of 7. Let me compute that point.First, the unit vector in the direction of ((7, 12)) is:[left( frac{7}{sqrt{193}}, frac{12}{sqrt{193}} right).]Multiplying by 7, the point on the annulus is:[left( frac{49}{sqrt{193}}, frac{84}{sqrt{193}} right).]So, the distance between ((7, 12)) and this point is:[sqrt{left(7 - frac{49}{sqrt{193}}right)^2 + left(12 - frac{84}{sqrt{193}}right)^2}.]Let me compute this:First, factor out (frac{49}{sqrt{193}}) and (frac{84}{sqrt{193}}):[sqrt{left(7 - frac{49}{sqrt{193}}right)^2 + left(12 - frac{84}{sqrt{193}}right)^2} = sqrt{left(7left(1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}right)right)^2 + left(12left(1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}right)right)^2}.]Factor out (1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}):[sqrt{left(1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}right)^2 (7^2 + 12^2)} = sqrt{left(1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}right)^2 times 193}.]Simplify:[sqrt{193} times left(1 - frac{7}{sqrt{193}}right) = sqrt{193} - 7.]So, the distance is indeed (sqrt{193} - 7), and squaring that gives (242 - 14sqrt{193}).Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is (242 - 14sqrt{193}).But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that the point ((x, y)) could be closer to ((7, 12)) if it's not along that line? For example, maybe some other point on the annulus could be closer? But since the annulus is centered at the origin, and the point ((7, 12)) is outside, the closest point should indeed be along the line connecting the origin to ((7, 12)). Because any other point on the annulus would be further away.Let me also consider the case when (alpha = beta = 0). Then,[x = 3 cos 0 + 4 sin 0 = 3(1) + 4(0) = 3,][y = 3 sin 0 + 4 cos 0 = 3(0) + 4(1) = 4.]So, the point is ((3, 4)). The distance squared from ((3, 4)) to ((7, 12)) is:[(3 - 7)^2 + (4 - 12)^2 = (-4)^2 + (-8)^2 = 16 + 64 = 80.]Which is much larger than (242 - 14sqrt{193}). Wait, but (242 - 14sqrt{193}) is approximately (242 - 14 times 13.89 approx 242 - 194.46 = 47.54), which is less than 80. So, the minimum value should indeed be around 47.54, which is less than 80.So, is there a specific (alpha) and (beta) that would make ((x, y)) equal to (left( frac{49}{sqrt{193}}, frac{84}{sqrt{193}} right))?Let me see. So, we have:[x = 3 cos alpha + 4 sin beta = frac{49}{sqrt{193}},][y = 3 sin alpha + 4 cos beta = frac{84}{sqrt{193}}.]Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can set (alpha = beta), but I don't know if that would necessarily work. Alternatively, perhaps I can express (x) and (y) in terms of a single angle.Wait, another approach: Since (x^2 + y^2 = 25 + 24 sin(alpha + beta)), the maximum value of (x^2 + y^2) is 49, which occurs when (sin(alpha + beta) = 1), i.e., when (alpha + beta = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi). Similarly, the minimum is 1 when (sin(alpha + beta) = -1).But in our case, we are trying to minimize the distance from ((x, y)) to ((7, 12)). So, perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some geometric interpretation.Alternatively, maybe I can consider this as an optimization problem with variables (alpha) and (beta), and use calculus to find the minimum. But that might be complicated because it's a function of two variables.Wait, another thought: Since (x^2 + y^2) can be as large as 49, and we're trying to minimize the distance from ((x, y)) to ((7, 12)), which is a fixed point. So, the minimal distance would be the distance from ((7, 12)) to the origin minus the maximum radius of the annulus, which is 7, as I thought earlier.So, the minimal distance is (sqrt{193} - 7), and the minimal distance squared is ((sqrt{193} - 7)^2 = 242 - 14sqrt{193}).Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is (242 - 14sqrt{193}).I think that makes sense. So, I'll go with that as the final answer.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{242 - 14sqrt{193}}."},{"question":"The equation[(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}]has three distinct solutions u, v, and w. Calculate the value of u^3 + v^3 + w^3.","answer":"Alright, so I have this equation: [(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}]. It says that this equation has three distinct solutions u, v, and w, and I need to find the value of u³ + v³ + w³. Hmm, okay.First, let me understand the equation. The left side is a product of three terms, each of which is (x minus the cube root of a number). The cube roots of 8, 27, and 64 are straightforward because 8 is 2³, 27 is 3³, and 64 is 4³. So, simplifying each cube root, I get:(sqrt[3]{8} = 2),(sqrt[3]{27} = 3),(sqrt[3]{64} = 4).So, the equation becomes: [(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = frac{1}{2}].I need to find the roots of this equation, which are u, v, and w, and then compute u³ + v³ + w³. I remember that for a cubic equation, if I can express it in the standard form (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0), I can use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. But wait, the given equation isn't set to zero; it's equal to 1/2. So, I need to rearrange it to get a standard cubic equation. Let me subtract 1/2 from both sides to set it to zero:[(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) - frac{1}{2} = 0].Let me expand the left-hand side. First, multiply (x - 2)(x - 3):[(x - 2)(x - 3) = x² - 3x - 2x + 6 = x² - 5x + 6].Now, multiply this result by (x - 4):[(x² - 5x + 6)(x - 4)].Let me expand this:First, multiply x² by (x - 4): x³ - 4x².Then, multiply -5x by (x - 4): -5x² + 20x.Finally, multiply 6 by (x - 4): 6x - 24.Now, add all these together:x³ - 4x² - 5x² + 20x + 6x - 24.Combine like terms:x³ - (4x² + 5x²) + (20x + 6x) - 24.Which simplifies to:x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.So, the expanded form of (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) is x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.Therefore, the equation becomes:x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24 - 1/2 = 0.Simplify the constants:-24 - 1/2 = -24.5, which is -49/2.So, the equation is:x³ - 9x² + 26x - 49/2 = 0.To make it easier, maybe I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:2x³ - 18x² + 52x - 49 = 0.So, now the equation is 2x³ - 18x² + 52x - 49 = 0.Let me denote this as:2x³ - 18x² + 52x - 49 = 0.So, the standard form is ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, where:a = 2,b = -18,c = 52,d = -49.Now, using Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation:If the roots are u, v, w, then:u + v + w = -b/a = -(-18)/2 = 9.uv + uw + vw = c/a = 52/2 = 26.uvw = -d/a = -(-49)/2 = 49/2.So, I have:u + v + w = 9,uv + uw + vw = 26,uvw = 49/2.Now, I need to find u³ + v³ + w³.I recall that there is a formula for the sum of cubes of roots:u³ + v³ + w³ = (u + v + w)³ - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw.Let me write that down:u³ + v³ + w³ = (u + v + w)³ - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw.Plugging in the values from Vieta's formulas:First, compute (u + v + w)³:(9)³ = 729.Then, compute 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw):3 * 9 * 26 = 3 * 234 = 702.Then, compute 3uvw:3 * (49/2) = 147/2 = 73.5.So, putting it all together:u³ + v³ + w³ = 729 - 702 + 73.5.Compute 729 - 702: that's 27.Then, 27 + 73.5 = 100.5.Wait, that's 100.5, which is 201/2.But wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.I think the formula is:u³ + v³ + w³ = (u + v + w)³ - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw.So, plugging in:729 - 3*9*26 + 3*(49/2).Compute each term:729 is correct.3*9*26: 3*9 is 27, 27*26: 27*20=540, 27*6=162, so 540+162=702. So, 702.3*(49/2)= 147/2=73.5.So, 729 - 702 + 73.5.729 - 702 is 27.27 + 73.5 is 100.5.Hmm, 100.5 is 201/2.But wait, the original equation was (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)=1/2.So, the roots u, v, w are close to 2, 3, 4, but shifted by 1/2.Wait, but 100.5 seems a bit high for u³ + v³ + w³. Let me think if there's another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that u, v, w are the roots of the equation (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)=1/2.Let me denote y = x. Then, the equation is (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) = 1/2.Let me expand the left side as before: y³ - 9y² + 26y - 24 = 1/2.So, y³ - 9y² + 26y - 24 - 1/2 = 0.Which is y³ - 9y² + 26y - 24.5 = 0.So, in standard form, it's y³ - 9y² + 26y - 49/2 = 0.So, the coefficients are a=1, b=-9, c=26, d=-49/2.Wait, earlier I multiplied by 2 to get rid of the fraction, but maybe I should have kept it as is.Wait, no, in the standard form, it's okay whether I have fractions or not.But when I applied Vieta's formulas, I considered the equation as 2x³ - 18x² + 52x - 49 = 0, which is correct because I multiplied both sides by 2.So, in that case, the coefficients are a=2, b=-18, c=52, d=-49.So, Vieta's formulas give:u + v + w = -b/a = 18/2 = 9,uv + uw + vw = c/a = 52/2 = 26,uvw = -d/a = 49/2.So, that seems correct.Therefore, plugging into the formula:u³ + v³ + w³ = (9)³ - 3*9*26 + 3*(49/2).Which is 729 - 702 + 73.5 = 100.5.Hmm, 100.5 is 201/2.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.Wait, another formula for u³ + v³ + w³ is:u³ + v³ + w³ = (u + v + w)^3 - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw.Yes, that's correct.So, 9³ - 3*9*26 + 3*(49/2).Compute 9³: 729.3*9*26: 3*9=27, 27*26=702.3*(49/2)= 147/2=73.5.So, 729 - 702 + 73.5.729 - 702 is 27.27 + 73.5 is 100.5.So, 100.5 is 201/2.Wait, but 201/2 is 100.5, which is correct.But let me think, is there another way to compute u³ + v³ + w³?Alternatively, since u, v, w are roots of the equation (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2, which is equivalent to x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.5 = 0.So, for each root, say u, we have u³ - 9u² + 26u - 24.5 = 0.Similarly for v and w.So, u³ = 9u² - 26u + 24.5,v³ = 9v² - 26v + 24.5,w³ = 9w² - 26w + 24.5.Therefore, adding them up:u³ + v³ + w³ = 9(u² + v² + w²) - 26(u + v + w) + 3*24.5.Compute each term:First, u + v + w = 9.Second, u² + v² + w²: I can compute this using the formula:u² + v² + w² = (u + v + w)² - 2(uv + uw + vw).So, (9)² - 2*26 = 81 - 52 = 29.Therefore, u² + v² + w² = 29.Third, 3*24.5 = 73.5.So, putting it all together:u³ + v³ + w³ = 9*29 - 26*9 + 73.5.Compute 9*29: 261.26*9: 234.So, 261 - 234 + 73.5.261 - 234 = 27.27 + 73.5 = 100.5.Same result as before.So, 100.5 is 201/2.But the problem asks for u³ + v³ + w³, so 201/2 is the answer.Wait, but 201/2 is 100.5, which is correct.But let me check if I can write it as a fraction: 201/2.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the original equation is (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.Let me denote y = x - something, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that u, v, w are the roots of the equation (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.So, if I let f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), then f(x) = 1/2.So, the roots u, v, w satisfy f(u) = f(v) = f(w) = 1/2.But how does that help me? Maybe not directly.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of u, v, w as being the roots of f(x) - 1/2 = 0, which is what I did earlier.So, f(x) - 1/2 = x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.5 = 0.So, the cubic equation is x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.5 = 0.Thus, the sum of the cubes of the roots is 100.5, which is 201/2.But let me check if that's correct.Wait, another way to compute u³ + v³ + w³ is to use Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums.Given that, for a cubic equation, the first few power sums can be computed.Let me recall that:p1 = u + v + w = 9,p2 = u² + v² + w² = (u + v + w)^2 - 2(uv + uw + vw) = 81 - 52 = 29,p3 = u³ + v³ + w³ = ?Newton's identities say that:p1 = s1,p2 = s1 p1 - 2 s2,p3 = s1 p2 - s2 p1 + 3 s3,where s1 = u + v + w,s2 = uv + uw + vw,s3 = uvw.So, in our case:s1 = 9,s2 = 26,s3 = 49/2.So, p3 = s1 p2 - s2 p1 + 3 s3.Compute each term:s1 p2 = 9 * 29 = 261,s2 p1 = 26 * 9 = 234,3 s3 = 3 * (49/2) = 147/2 = 73.5.So, p3 = 261 - 234 + 73.5 = 27 + 73.5 = 100.5.Same result.Therefore, u³ + v³ + w³ = 100.5 = 201/2.But wait, the original equation was (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.So, the roots u, v, w are close to 2, 3, 4, but shifted a bit.But 201/2 seems correct.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the equation is given as:[(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}].Which simplifies to (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.So, the roots are u, v, w, which are the solutions to this equation.Therefore, the sum of their cubes is 201/2.But let me check if I can write it as a mixed number or if it's better to leave it as an improper fraction.201 divided by 2 is 100 with a remainder of 1, so 100 1/2, which is 100.5.But in the box, I should write it as boxed{dfrac{201}{2}}.Alternatively, if the problem expects an integer, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me think again.Wait, in the initial step, I considered the equation (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.But perhaps I can think of it as f(x) = 1/2, where f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4).So, the roots u, v, w are the x-values where f(x) = 1/2.But f(x) is a cubic function, so it's symmetric in some way, but not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that u, v, w are close to 2, 3, 4, but slightly shifted.But regardless, the algebra shows that u³ + v³ + w³ = 201/2.Wait, but let me think if there's another approach.Suppose I let y = x - something, but I don't see an immediate substitution.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that u, v, w are the roots of f(x) = 1/2, so f(u) = 1/2, f(v)=1/2, f(w)=1/2.But f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4).So, f(u) = (u - 2)(u - 3)(u - 4) = 1/2.Similarly for v and w.But how does that help me find u³ + v³ + w³?Alternatively, maybe I can express u³ in terms of u², u, and constants.From f(u) = 1/2,(u - 2)(u - 3)(u - 4) = 1/2.Let me expand the left side:(u - 2)(u - 3)(u - 4) = u³ - 9u² + 26u - 24.So, u³ - 9u² + 26u - 24 = 1/2.Therefore, u³ = 9u² - 26u + 24 + 1/2 = 9u² - 26u + 24.5.Similarly, v³ = 9v² - 26v + 24.5,w³ = 9w² - 26w + 24.5.Therefore, u³ + v³ + w³ = 9(u² + v² + w²) - 26(u + v + w) + 3*24.5.We already know u + v + w = 9,and u² + v² + w² = (u + v + w)^2 - 2(uv + uw + vw) = 81 - 52 = 29.So, u³ + v³ + w³ = 9*29 - 26*9 + 73.5.Compute 9*29: 261,26*9: 234,73.5 is 3*24.5.So, 261 - 234 = 27,27 + 73.5 = 100.5.Same result.Therefore, I think 100.5 is correct, which is 201/2.But let me check if the problem expects an integer or a fraction.The problem says to put the answer in a box, so likely as a fraction.Therefore, 201/2 is the answer.But wait, in the initial problem, the equation is (x - cube roots) = 1/2.But cube roots of 8, 27, 64 are 2, 3, 4, so the equation is (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2.So, the roots u, v, w are near 2, 3, 4, but slightly shifted.But regardless, the algebra shows that u³ + v³ + w³ = 201/2.Therefore, the answer is 201/2.But wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"The equation[(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}]has three distinct solutions u, v, and w. Calculate the value of u³ + v³ + w³.\\"So, the answer is 201/2.But wait, in the initial assistant's answer, it was -42.Wait, that's conflicting.Wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"The equation[(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}]has three distinct solutions u, v, and w. Calculate the value of u³ + v³ + w³.\\"But in the assistant's answer, it was:Let the roots of (x - cube roots) = 0 be δ, ε, ζ.Then, using Vieta's, u + v + w = δ + ε + ζ,uv + uw + vw = δε + δζ + εζ,uvw = δεζ + 1/2.Then, using the identity u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = (u + v + w)((u + v + w)^2 - 3(uv + uw + vw)).So, u³ + v³ + w³ = (u + v + w)^3 - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw.But in the assistant's answer, they said:u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.But wait, that's not correct.Because u, v, w are roots of (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 1/2,so the equation is (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) - 1/2 = 0,which expands to x³ - (δ + ε + ζ)x² + (δε + δζ + εζ)x - δεζ - 1/2 = 0.Therefore, the coefficients are:a = 1,b = -(δ + ε + ζ),c = δε + δζ + εζ,d = -δεζ - 1/2.Therefore, using Vieta's formulas:u + v + w = δ + ε + ζ,uv + uw + vw = δε + δζ + εζ,uvw = δεζ + 1/2.So, the assistant correctly noted that uvw = δεζ + 1/2.Then, the assistant used the identity:u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = (u + v + w)((u + v + w)^2 - 3(uv + uw + vw)).Which is correct.But then, the assistant said:Thus, from the equations above:u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.Wait, that seems incorrect.Because u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw is equal to (u + v + w)((u + v + w)^2 - 3(uv + uw + vw)).But the assistant equated it to δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.But δ, ε, ζ are the roots of the equation (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 0, which is the original equation without the 1/2.So, for the equation (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 0,the sum of cubes of roots is δ³ + ε³ + ζ³.But in our case, u, v, w are roots of (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 1/2.Therefore, u³ + v³ + w³ is not equal to δ³ + ε³ + ζ³.So, the assistant's step was incorrect.Therefore, the assistant's answer of -42 is wrong.So, my initial approach was correct, leading to 201/2.But let me check again.Wait, in the assistant's answer, they said:u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.But that's not correct.Because u, v, w are not the roots of (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 0, but of (x - δ)(x - ε)(x - ζ) = 1/2.Therefore, the identity u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw is not equal to δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.Instead, we need to compute u³ + v³ + w³ using the correct Vieta's formulas for the shifted equation.Therefore, the correct answer is 201/2.But wait, let me think again.Wait, in the assistant's answer, they said:u³ + v³ + w³ - 3uvw = δ³ + ε³ + ζ³ - 3δεζ.But that's incorrect because u, v, w are not the roots of the original cubic, but of a shifted cubic.Therefore, the assistant made a mistake in that step.Therefore, the correct answer is 201/2.But wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"The equation[(x - sqrt[3]{8})(x - sqrt[3]{27})(x - sqrt[3]{64}) = frac{1}{2}]has three distinct solutions u, v, and w. Calculate the value of u³ + v³ + w³.\\"So, the correct answer is 201/2.But in the assistant's answer, they got -42, which is wrong.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 201/2.But wait, let me check the calculations again.Wait, in my initial calculation, I considered the equation as:(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 1/2,expanded it to x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24 = 1/2,then subtracted 1/2 to get x³ - 9x² + 26x - 24.5 = 0,then multiplied by 2 to get 2x³ - 18x² + 52x - 49 = 0,then used Vieta's formulas:u + v + w = 9,uv + uw + vw = 26,uvw = 49/2.Then, using the formula for u³ + v³ + w³,which is (u + v + w)^3 - 3(u + v + w)(uv + uw + vw) + 3uvw,which is 729 - 702 + 73.5 = 100.5 = 201/2.Therefore, the correct answer is 201/2.But wait, in the assistant's answer, they got -42, which is incorrect.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 201/2.But let me check if I can write it as a mixed number or if it's better to leave it as an improper fraction.201/2 is 100 1/2, but in the box, it's better to write it as boxed{dfrac{201}{2}}.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{dfrac{201}{2}}."},{"question":"Given the functions g(x)=x^{2}+(a-1)x+a-2a^{2} and h(x)=(x-1)^{2}, let set A be the solution set of the inequality g(x) > 0, and set B be the solution set of the inequality h(x) < 1.(1) If set A cap B neq emptyset, find the range of real number a.(2) Given log _{x}[f(x)]-log _{x}[g(x)]=1 and set C as the solution set of the inequality f(x) > 0, if set C cap B neq emptyset, find the range of real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with two parts. Let me try to figure out part (1) first.We have two functions: ( g(x) = x^2 + (a - 1)x + a - 2a^2 ) and ( h(x) = (x - 1)^2 ). Set ( A ) is the solution set of ( g(x) > 0 ), and set ( B ) is the solution set of ( h(x) < 1 ). I need to find the range of real number ( a ) such that ( A cap B neq emptyset ).First, let me understand what set ( B ) is. The inequality ( h(x) < 1 ) translates to ( (x - 1)^2 < 1 ). To solve this, I can take square roots on both sides, remembering that this will give me a range for ( x ).So, ( (x - 1)^2 < 1 ) implies ( -1 < x - 1 < 1 ). Adding 1 to all parts, I get ( 0 < x < 2 ). Therefore, set ( B ) is the interval ( (0, 2) ).Now, moving on to set ( A ), which is the solution set of ( g(x) > 0 ). The function ( g(x) ) is a quadratic, so I can analyze its roots to determine where it's positive.Let me write ( g(x) ) in standard quadratic form: ( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (a - 2a^2) ). To find the roots, I can factor or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first.Looking at the quadratic, I can try to factor it as ( (x - r_1)(x - r_2) ), where ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) are the roots. Expanding this, I get ( x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2 ). Comparing coefficients with ( g(x) ), I have:- Coefficient of ( x ): ( -(r_1 + r_2) = a - 1 ) ⇒ ( r_1 + r_2 = 1 - a )- Constant term: ( r_1 r_2 = a - 2a^2 )Hmm, factoring might be a bit tricky here. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula instead. The quadratic formula is ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where in this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = (a - 1) ), and ( c = (a - 2a^2) ).Plugging in, the discriminant ( D ) is:( D = (a - 1)^2 - 4 times 1 times (a - 2a^2) )= ( (a^2 - 2a + 1) - 4(a - 2a^2) )= ( a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4a + 8a^2 )= ( 9a^2 - 6a + 1 )So, the roots are:( x = frac{-(a - 1) pm sqrt{9a^2 - 6a + 1}}{2} )= ( frac{1 - a pm sqrt{9a^2 - 6a + 1}}{2} )Hmm, the discriminant ( D = 9a^2 - 6a + 1 ) can be factored as ( (3a - 1)^2 ). Let me check:( (3a - 1)^2 = 9a^2 - 6a + 1 ). Yes, that's correct.So, the roots simplify to:( x = frac{1 - a pm (3a - 1)}{2} )Let me compute both roots:First root with the plus sign:( x = frac{1 - a + 3a - 1}{2} = frac{2a}{2} = a )Second root with the minus sign:( x = frac{1 - a - 3a + 1}{2} = frac{2 - 4a}{2} = 1 - 2a )So, the roots are ( x = a ) and ( x = 1 - 2a ). Therefore, the quadratic can be factored as ( (x - a)(x - (1 - 2a)) ).So, ( g(x) = (x - a)(x - (1 - 2a)) ).Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x ) is less than the smaller root or greater than the larger root.Now, I need to determine which root is smaller: ( a ) or ( 1 - 2a ).Let me compare ( a ) and ( 1 - 2a ):Case 1: ( a < 1 - 2a )Solving for ( a ):( a < 1 - 2a )( 3a < 1 )( a < frac{1}{3} )Case 2: ( a geq 1 - 2a )Which would be when ( a geq frac{1}{3} )So, depending on the value of ( a ), the order of the roots changes.Therefore, the solution set ( A ) is:- If ( a < frac{1}{3} ), then ( x < a ) or ( x > 1 - 2a )- If ( a geq frac{1}{3} ), then ( x < 1 - 2a ) or ( x > a )But wait, when ( a = frac{1}{3} ), both roots coincide because ( 1 - 2a = 1 - 2*(1/3) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 ). So, in that case, the quadratic touches the x-axis at ( x = 1/3 ), so ( g(x) > 0 ) for all ( x neq 1/3 ). But since it's a double root, the quadratic is always non-negative, but strictly positive except at the root.But in our case, ( g(x) > 0 ), so when ( a = 1/3 ), ( g(x) ) is positive everywhere except at ( x = 1/3 ). So, set ( A ) would be ( mathbb{R} setminus {1/3} ). But since ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ), their intersection would be ( (0, 2) setminus {1/3} ), which is still non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable? Wait, but in the initial analysis, when ( a = 1/3 ), the quadratic is a perfect square, so ( g(x) = (x - 1/3)^2 ), which is always non-negative, but ( g(x) > 0 ) everywhere except at ( x = 1/3 ). So, set ( A ) is ( (-infty, 1/3) cup (1/3, infty) ). So, the intersection with ( B = (0, 2) ) is ( (0, 1/3) cup (1/3, 2) ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable.But wait, in the initial problem statement, part (1) says \\"If set ( A cap B neq emptyset ), find the range of real number ( a ).\\" So, ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable because ( A cap B ) is non-empty.But let me think again. If ( a = 1/3 ), then ( A ) is all real numbers except ( 1/3 ). So, ( A cap B ) is ( (0, 2) ) except ( 1/3 ), which is still an interval, so it's non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is allowed.But let me check the initial analysis where I considered two cases: ( a < 1/3 ) and ( a geq 1/3 ). So, in the case ( a = 1/3 ), the quadratic is a perfect square, so ( g(x) > 0 ) everywhere except at ( x = 1/3 ). So, set ( A ) is ( (-infty, 1/3) cup (1/3, infty) ). Therefore, ( A cap B = (0, 2) setminus {1/3} ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable.But wait, in the initial analysis, when I considered ( a = 1/3 ), I thought ( A ) would be empty, but that's not correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake there.Wait, no. When ( a = 1/3 ), the quadratic is ( (x - 1/3)^2 ), which is always non-negative, so ( g(x) > 0 ) is true for all ( x ) except ( x = 1/3 ). So, set ( A ) is ( mathbb{R} setminus {1/3} ), which is not empty. Therefore, ( A cap B ) is ( (0, 2) setminus {1/3} ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable.But in the initial analysis, I thought when ( a = 1/3 ), ( A ) is empty, which was incorrect. So, I need to correct that.So, moving forward, the solution set ( A ) is:- If ( a < 1/3 ), then ( x < a ) or ( x > 1 - 2a )- If ( a geq 1/3 ), then ( x < 1 - 2a ) or ( x > a )But wait, when ( a = 1/3 ), both roots are equal, so ( A ) is ( mathbb{R} setminus {1/3} ).Now, set ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ). So, we need ( A cap B ) to be non-empty.So, depending on the value of ( a ), we need to ensure that there is some overlap between ( A ) and ( B ).Let me consider the two cases:Case 1: ( a < 1/3 )In this case, ( A = (-infty, a) cup (1 - 2a, infty) )We need ( A cap B neq emptyset ). So, ( (-infty, a) cap (0, 2) ) or ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) must be non-empty.So, let's check:First, ( (-infty, a) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( a > 0 ). Because if ( a > 0 ), then ( (0, a) ) is part of ( A cap B ).Second, ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( 1 - 2a < 2 ). Because then, ( (1 - 2a, 2) ) is part of ( A cap B ).But since ( a < 1/3 ), let's see:First condition: ( a > 0 ). So, if ( a > 0 ), then ( A cap B ) is non-empty.Second condition: ( 1 - 2a < 2 ). Solving:( 1 - 2a < 2 )( -2a < 1 )( 2a > -1 )( a > -1/2 )But since ( a < 1/3 ), combining both conditions, we have ( -1/2 < a < 1/3 ).But wait, if ( a leq 0 ), then ( (-infty, a) cap (0, 2) ) is empty, but ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is ( a > -1/2 ). So, for ( a leq 0 ), as long as ( a > -1/2 ), ( A cap B ) is non-empty.Therefore, in Case 1 (( a < 1/3 )), ( A cap B neq emptyset ) if ( -1/2 < a < 1/3 ).Case 2: ( a geq 1/3 )In this case, ( A = (-infty, 1 - 2a) cup (a, infty) )We need ( A cap B neq emptyset ). So, ( (-infty, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) ) or ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) must be non-empty.First, ( (-infty, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( 1 - 2a > 0 ). Because then, ( (0, 1 - 2a) ) is part of ( A cap B ).Second, ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( a < 2 ). Because then, ( (a, 2) ) is part of ( A cap B ).So, let's analyze:First condition: ( 1 - 2a > 0 ) ⇒ ( a < 1/2 )Second condition: ( a < 2 )But since ( a geq 1/3 ), combining these:If ( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 ), then both conditions are satisfied, so ( A cap B ) is non-empty.If ( 1/2 leq a < 2 ), then ( 1 - 2a leq 0 ), so ( (-infty, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) ) is empty, but ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty as long as ( a < 2 ). So, for ( 1/2 leq a < 2 ), ( A cap B ) is non-empty.If ( a geq 2 ), then ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is empty, and ( 1 - 2a ) is negative, so ( (-infty, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) ) is also empty. Therefore, ( A cap B ) is empty.Therefore, in Case 2 (( a geq 1/3 )), ( A cap B neq emptyset ) if ( 1/3 leq a < 2 ).But wait, when ( a = 1/3 ), as we saw earlier, ( A cap B ) is non-empty because ( A ) is ( mathbb{R} setminus {1/3} ), so their intersection is ( (0, 2) setminus {1/3} ), which is non-empty.So, combining both cases:- For ( -1/2 < a < 1/3 ), ( A cap B neq emptyset )- For ( 1/3 leq a < 2 ), ( A cap B neq emptyset )Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ), excluding ( a = 2 ) because at ( a = 2 ), ( A cap B ) is empty.Wait, but when ( a = 2 ), let's check:( g(x) = x^2 + (2 - 1)x + 2 - 2*(2)^2 = x^2 + x + 2 - 8 = x^2 + x - 6 )Factoring, ( x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) ). So, roots at ( x = -3 ) and ( x = 2 ). Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x < -3 ) or ( x > 2 ). So, set ( A = (-infty, -3) cup (2, infty) ). Set ( B = (0, 2) ). So, ( A cap B = (2, infty) cap (0, 2) = emptyset ). Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is excluded.Similarly, when ( a = -1/2 ), let's check:( g(x) = x^2 + (-1/2 - 1)x + (-1/2) - 2*(-1/2)^2 = x^2 - (3/2)x - 1/2 - 2*(1/4) = x^2 - (3/2)x - 1/2 - 1/2 = x^2 - (3/2)x - 1 )Let me find the roots:Discriminant ( D = ( -3/2 )^2 - 4*1*(-1) = 9/4 + 4 = 25/4 ). So, roots are:( x = frac{3/2 pm 5/2}{2} )First root: ( (3/2 + 5/2)/2 = (8/2)/2 = 4/2 = 2 )Second root: ( (3/2 - 5/2)/2 = (-2/2)/2 = (-1)/2 = -1 )So, ( g(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1) ). Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 2 ). So, set ( A = (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty) ). Set ( B = (0, 2) ). So, ( A cap B = (2, infty) cap (0, 2) = emptyset ). Therefore, ( a = -1/2 ) is excluded.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).Wait, but in the initial analysis, I had two separate intervals: ( (-1/2, 1/3) ) and ( (1/3, 2) ). But since ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable, it's actually a single interval ( (-1/2, 2) ).But wait, when ( a = 1/3 ), as we saw, ( A cap B ) is non-empty. So, the range is ( (-1/2, 2) ).But let me double-check for ( a = 1/3 ):( g(x) = (x - 1/3)^2 ), so ( g(x) > 0 ) everywhere except ( x = 1/3 ). So, ( A = mathbb{R} setminus {1/3} ). Therefore, ( A cap B = (0, 2) setminus {1/3} ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 1/3 ) is included.Similarly, for ( a = -1/2 ), as we saw, ( A cap B ) is empty, so ( a = -1/2 ) is excluded.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).Wait, but in the initial analysis, I had two separate intervals: ( (-1/2, 1/3) ) and ( (1/3, 2) ). But since ( a = 1/3 ) is acceptable, it's actually a single interval ( (-1/2, 2) ).But let me think again. When ( a = 1/3 ), it's acceptable, so the interval is continuous from ( -1/2 ) to ( 2 ), excluding the endpoints.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).Wait, but in the initial problem statement, part (1) says \\"If set ( A cap B neq emptyset ), find the range of real number ( a ).\\" So, the answer should be ( a ) in ( (-1/2, 2) ).But let me check for ( a = 0 ), which is within ( (-1/2, 2) ):( g(x) = x^2 + (-1)x + 0 - 0 = x^2 - x ). So, roots at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ). Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x < 0 ) or ( x > 1 ). So, set ( A = (-infty, 0) cup (1, infty) ). Set ( B = (0, 2) ). So, ( A cap B = (1, 2) ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 0 ) is acceptable.Similarly, for ( a = 1 ), which is within ( (1/3, 2) ):( g(x) = x^2 + (1 - 1)x + 1 - 2*(1)^2 = x^2 + 0x + 1 - 2 = x^2 - 1 ). So, roots at ( x = 1 ) and ( x = -1 ). Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 1 ). So, set ( A = (-infty, -1) cup (1, infty) ). Set ( B = (0, 2) ). So, ( A cap B = (1, 2) ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = 1 ) is acceptable.For ( a = -1/4 ), which is within ( (-1/2, 1/3) ):( g(x) = x^2 + (-1/4 - 1)x + (-1/4) - 2*(-1/4)^2 = x^2 - (5/4)x - 1/4 - 2*(1/16) = x^2 - (5/4)x - 1/4 - 1/8 = x^2 - (5/4)x - 3/8 )Let me find the roots:Discriminant ( D = ( -5/4 )^2 - 4*1*(-3/8) = 25/16 + 12/8 = 25/16 + 24/16 = 49/16 ). So, roots are:( x = frac{5/4 pm 7/4}{2} )First root: ( (5/4 + 7/4)/2 = (12/4)/2 = 3/2 )Second root: ( (5/4 - 7/4)/2 = (-2/4)/2 = (-1/2)/2 = -1/4 )So, ( g(x) = (x - 3/2)(x + 1/4) ). Therefore, ( g(x) > 0 ) when ( x < -1/4 ) or ( x > 3/2 ). So, set ( A = (-infty, -1/4) cup (3/2, infty) ). Set ( B = (0, 2) ). So, ( A cap B = (3/2, 2) ), which is non-empty. So, ( a = -1/4 ) is acceptable.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).But wait, in the initial analysis, I thought it was two separate intervals, but it's actually a single interval because ( a = 1/3 ) is included.So, the final answer for part (1) is ( a ) in ( (-1/2, 2) ).Now, moving on to part (2):Given ( log_x [f(x)] - log_x [g(x)] = 1 ) and set ( C ) as the solution set of ( f(x) > 0 ), if ( C cap B neq emptyset ), find the range of real number ( a ).First, let's analyze the given equation:( log_x [f(x)] - log_x [g(x)] = 1 )Using logarithm properties, this can be rewritten as:( log_x left( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} right) = 1 )Which implies:( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = x^1 = x )Therefore, ( f(x) = x cdot g(x) )So, ( f(x) = x cdot g(x) = x(x - a)(x - (1 - 2a)) )We need to find the solution set ( C ) of ( f(x) > 0 ).So, ( f(x) = x(x - a)(x - (1 - 2a)) )We need to determine where this product is positive.First, note that ( x ) must be positive because the logarithm is defined only for positive real numbers. So, ( x > 0 ).Therefore, the domain of ( f(x) ) is ( x > 0 ).Now, let's find the roots of ( f(x) ):The roots are ( x = 0 ), ( x = a ), and ( x = 1 - 2a ).But since ( x > 0 ), we can ignore ( x = 0 ) because it's not in the domain.So, the critical points are ( x = a ) and ( x = 1 - 2a ).We need to analyze the sign of ( f(x) ) in the intervals determined by these critical points.But first, we need to determine the order of ( a ) and ( 1 - 2a ).So, let's compare ( a ) and ( 1 - 2a ):Case 1: ( a < 1 - 2a )Solving:( a < 1 - 2a )( 3a < 1 )( a < 1/3 )Case 2: ( a geq 1 - 2a )Which is when ( a geq 1/3 )So, depending on ( a ), the order of the roots changes.Therefore, the intervals to consider are:- If ( a < 1/3 ), then ( 0 < a < 1 - 2a ) (since ( a > 0 ) because ( x > 0 ))- If ( a geq 1/3 ), then ( 0 < 1 - 2a leq a ) (but we need to check if ( 1 - 2a > 0 ))Wait, if ( a geq 1/3 ), then ( 1 - 2a leq 1 - 2*(1/3) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 ). So, ( 1 - 2a ) could be positive or negative.Wait, let's see:If ( a < 1/2 ), then ( 1 - 2a > 0 ).If ( a = 1/2 ), ( 1 - 2a = 0 ).If ( a > 1/2 ), ( 1 - 2a < 0 ).So, combining with ( a geq 1/3 ):- If ( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 ), then ( 1 - 2a > 0 )- If ( a = 1/2 ), ( 1 - 2a = 0 )- If ( a > 1/2 ), ( 1 - 2a < 0 )Therefore, for ( a geq 1/3 ):- If ( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 ), the roots are ( x = a ) and ( x = 1 - 2a ), with ( 1 - 2a > 0 )- If ( a = 1/2 ), the root is ( x = 0 ) (but ( x > 0 ), so only ( x = a = 1/2 ))- If ( a > 1/2 ), the root ( x = 1 - 2a ) is negative, so only ( x = a ) is in the domain ( x > 0 )Therefore, let's analyze the sign of ( f(x) ) in each case.Case 1: ( a < 1/3 )In this case, ( 0 < a < 1 - 2a )So, the critical points are ( x = a ) and ( x = 1 - 2a ), both positive.We can test the intervals:- ( (0, a) )- ( (a, 1 - 2a) )- ( (1 - 2a, infty) )Let me pick test points in each interval.First interval: ( (0, a) ). Let me choose ( x = a/2 ).Compute ( f(a/2) = (a/2)(a/2 - a)(a/2 - (1 - 2a)) )Simplify:= ( (a/2)(-a/2)(a/2 - 1 + 2a) )= ( (a/2)(-a/2)(5a/2 - 1) )The sign depends on the product:- ( a/2 > 0 ) (since ( a > 0 ))- ( -a/2 < 0 )- ( 5a/2 - 1 ): depends on ( a ). If ( a < 2/5 ), then ( 5a/2 - 1 < 0 ). If ( a > 2/5 ), then ( 5a/2 - 1 > 0 ). At ( a = 2/5 ), it's zero.So, the sign of ( f(a/2) ):If ( a < 2/5 ):= ( (+) times (-) times (-) = (+) )If ( a > 2/5 ):= ( (+) times (-) times (+) = (-) )At ( a = 2/5 ), ( f(a/2) = 0 ), which is not in the solution set.But since ( a < 1/3 ) and ( 2/5 = 0.4 ), which is greater than 1/3 ≈ 0.333, so for ( a < 1/3 ), ( a < 2/5 ) is always true. Therefore, in this interval, ( f(x) > 0 ).Second interval: ( (a, 1 - 2a) ). Let me choose ( x = (a + 1 - 2a)/2 = (1 - a)/2 ).Compute ( f((1 - a)/2) = (1 - a)/2 * ((1 - a)/2 - a) * ((1 - a)/2 - (1 - 2a)) )Simplify:= ( (1 - a)/2 * ( (1 - a - 2a)/2 ) * ( (1 - a - 2 + 4a)/2 ) )= ( (1 - a)/2 * ( (1 - 3a)/2 ) * ( ( -1 + 3a )/2 ) )So, the product is:= ( (1 - a)(1 - 3a)(-1 + 3a) / 8 )Let me analyze the sign:- ( 1 - a > 0 ) since ( a < 1 )- ( 1 - 3a > 0 ) since ( a < 1/3 )- ( -1 + 3a < 0 ) since ( a < 1/3 )So, the product is ( (+) times (+) times (-) = (-) ). Therefore, ( f(x) < 0 ) in this interval.Third interval: ( (1 - 2a, infty) ). Let me choose ( x = 2(1 - 2a) ), assuming ( 2(1 - 2a) > 1 - 2a ), which is true since ( 1 - 2a > 0 ).Compute ( f(2(1 - 2a)) = 2(1 - 2a) * (2(1 - 2a) - a) * (2(1 - 2a) - (1 - 2a)) )Simplify:= ( 2(1 - 2a) * (2 - 4a - a) * (2(1 - 2a) - 1 + 2a) )= ( 2(1 - 2a) * (2 - 5a) * (2 - 4a - 1 + 2a) )= ( 2(1 - 2a) * (2 - 5a) * (1 - 2a) )So, the product is:= ( 2(1 - 2a)^2(2 - 5a) )Since ( a < 1/3 ), ( 2 - 5a > 2 - 5*(1/3) = 2 - 5/3 = 1/3 > 0 ). Also, ( (1 - 2a)^2 > 0 ). Therefore, the product is positive. So, ( f(x) > 0 ) in this interval.Therefore, in Case 1 (( a < 1/3 )), ( f(x) > 0 ) when ( x in (0, a) cup (1 - 2a, infty) ). So, set ( C = (0, a) cup (1 - 2a, infty) ).Case 2: ( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 )In this case, ( 0 < 1 - 2a < a )So, the critical points are ( x = 1 - 2a ) and ( x = a ), with ( 1 - 2a < a )Therefore, the intervals are:- ( (0, 1 - 2a) )- ( (1 - 2a, a) )- ( (a, infty) )Let me test each interval.First interval: ( (0, 1 - 2a) ). Let me choose ( x = (1 - 2a)/2 ).Compute ( f((1 - 2a)/2) = (1 - 2a)/2 * ((1 - 2a)/2 - a) * ((1 - 2a)/2 - (1 - 2a)) )Simplify:= ( (1 - 2a)/2 * ( (1 - 2a - 2a)/2 ) * ( (1 - 2a - 2 + 4a)/2 ) )= ( (1 - 2a)/2 * ( (1 - 4a)/2 ) * ( (-1 + 2a)/2 ) )So, the product is:= ( (1 - 2a)(1 - 4a)(-1 + 2a) / 8 )Analyzing the sign:- ( 1 - 2a > 0 ) since ( a < 1/2 )- ( 1 - 4a > 0 ) since ( a < 1/4 ). But since ( a geq 1/3 ), which is approximately 0.333, and ( 1/4 = 0.25 ), so for ( a geq 1/3 ), ( 1 - 4a leq 1 - 4*(1/3) = 1 - 4/3 = -1/3 < 0 )- ( -1 + 2a < 0 ) since ( a < 1/2 )So, the product is:= ( (+) times (-) times (-) = (+) )Therefore, ( f(x) > 0 ) in this interval.Second interval: ( (1 - 2a, a) ). Let me choose ( x = (1 - 2a + a)/2 = (1 - a)/2 ).Compute ( f((1 - a)/2) = (1 - a)/2 * ((1 - a)/2 - a) * ((1 - a)/2 - (1 - 2a)) )Simplify:= ( (1 - a)/2 * ( (1 - a - 2a)/2 ) * ( (1 - a - 2 + 4a)/2 ) )= ( (1 - a)/2 * ( (1 - 3a)/2 ) * ( (-1 + 3a)/2 ) )So, the product is:= ( (1 - a)(1 - 3a)(-1 + 3a) / 8 )Analyzing the sign:- ( 1 - a > 0 ) since ( a < 1 )- ( 1 - 3a > 0 ) since ( a < 1/3 ). But in this case, ( a geq 1/3 ), so ( 1 - 3a leq 0 )- ( -1 + 3a < 0 ) since ( a < 1/3 ). But ( a geq 1/3 ), so ( -1 + 3a geq 0 ) when ( a geq 1/3 )Wait, let's see:Since ( a geq 1/3 ), ( 1 - 3a leq 0 ) and ( -1 + 3a geq 0 ).Therefore, the product is:= ( (+) times (-) times (+) = (-) )Therefore, ( f(x) < 0 ) in this interval.Third interval: ( (a, infty) ). Let me choose ( x = 2a ).Compute ( f(2a) = 2a * (2a - a) * (2a - (1 - 2a)) )= ( 2a * a * (2a - 1 + 2a) )= ( 2a * a * (4a - 1) )So, the product is:= ( 2a^2(4a - 1) )Since ( a geq 1/3 ), ( 4a - 1 geq 4*(1/3) - 1 = 4/3 - 1 = 1/3 > 0 ). Also, ( 2a^2 > 0 ). Therefore, the product is positive. So, ( f(x) > 0 ) in this interval.Therefore, in Case 2 (( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 )), ( f(x) > 0 ) when ( x in (0, 1 - 2a) cup (a, infty) ). So, set ( C = (0, 1 - 2a) cup (a, infty) ).Case 3: ( a = 1/2 )In this case, ( 1 - 2a = 0 ), so the roots are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1/2 ). But ( x > 0 ), so the critical point is ( x = 1/2 ).Therefore, the intervals are:- ( (0, 1/2) )- ( (1/2, infty) )Testing ( x = 1/4 ):( f(1/4) = 1/4 * (1/4 - 1/2) * (1/4 - 0) = 1/4 * (-1/4) * 1/4 = -1/64 < 0 )Testing ( x = 1 ):( f(1) = 1 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 0) = 1 * 1/2 * 1 = 1/2 > 0 )Therefore, ( f(x) > 0 ) when ( x in (1/2, infty) ). So, set ( C = (1/2, infty) ).Case 4: ( a > 1/2 )In this case, ( 1 - 2a < 0 ), so the only critical point in ( x > 0 ) is ( x = a ).Therefore, the intervals are:- ( (0, a) )- ( (a, infty) )Testing ( x = a/2 ):( f(a/2) = a/2 * (a/2 - a) * (a/2 - (1 - 2a)) )= ( a/2 * (-a/2) * (a/2 - 1 + 2a) )= ( a/2 * (-a/2) * (5a/2 - 1) )Since ( a > 1/2 ), ( 5a/2 - 1 > 5*(1/2)/2 - 1 = 5/4 - 1 = 1/4 > 0 )So, the product is:= ( (+) times (-) times (+) = (-) )Therefore, ( f(x) < 0 ) in ( (0, a) )Testing ( x = 2a ):( f(2a) = 2a * (2a - a) * (2a - (1 - 2a)) )= ( 2a * a * (4a - 1) )Since ( a > 1/2 ), ( 4a - 1 > 4*(1/2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 > 0 ). Also, ( 2a^2 > 0 ). Therefore, the product is positive. So, ( f(x) > 0 ) in ( (a, infty) ).Therefore, in Case 4 (( a > 1/2 )), ( f(x) > 0 ) when ( x in (a, infty) ). So, set ( C = (a, infty) ).Now, we need to find the range of ( a ) such that ( C cap B neq emptyset ). Recall that ( B = (0, 2) ).So, depending on the case, let's analyze:Case 1: ( a < 1/3 )Set ( C = (0, a) cup (1 - 2a, infty) )We need ( C cap B neq emptyset ). So, either ( (0, a) cap (0, 2) ) or ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) must be non-empty.First, ( (0, a) cap (0, 2) = (0, a) ), which is non-empty as long as ( a > 0 ).Second, ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty if ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is always true since ( 1 - 2a < 2 ) ⇒ ( -2a < 1 ) ⇒ ( a > -1/2 ), which is always true since ( a < 1/3 ) and ( a ) is a real number.But since ( a < 1/3 ), and ( 1 - 2a > 0 ) when ( a < 1/2 ), which is always true here, so ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) = (1 - 2a, 2) ), which is non-empty as long as ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is always true.Therefore, in Case 1 (( a < 1/3 )), ( C cap B ) is non-empty as long as ( a > 0 ). Because if ( a leq 0 ), then ( (0, a) ) is empty, and ( (1 - 2a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) is non-empty only if ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is always true, but ( 1 - 2a > 0 ) when ( a < 1/2 ), which is true here. So, even if ( a leq 0 ), ( (1 - 2a, 2) ) is non-empty because ( 1 - 2a > 1 ) when ( a < 0 ), so ( (1 - 2a, 2) ) is non-empty as long as ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is always true.Wait, but if ( a leq 0 ), then ( 1 - 2a geq 1 ), so ( (1 - 2a, 2) ) is non-empty as long as ( 1 - 2a < 2 ), which is ( a > -1/2 ).Therefore, in Case 1 (( a < 1/3 )), ( C cap B neq emptyset ) if ( a > -1/2 ).But since ( a < 1/3 ), combining with ( a > -1/2 ), we have ( -1/2 < a < 1/3 ).Case 2: ( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 )Set ( C = (0, 1 - 2a) cup (a, infty) )We need ( C cap B neq emptyset ). So, either ( (0, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) ) or ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) ) must be non-empty.First, ( (0, 1 - 2a) cap (0, 2) = (0, 1 - 2a) ), which is non-empty as long as ( 1 - 2a > 0 ), which is true since ( a < 1/2 ).Second, ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) = (a, 2) ), which is non-empty as long as ( a < 2 ), which is true since ( a < 1/2 < 2 ).Therefore, in Case 2 (( 1/3 leq a < 1/2 )), ( C cap B neq emptyset ) is always true.Case 3: ( a = 1/2 )Set ( C = (1/2, infty) )We need ( C cap B neq emptyset ). So, ( (1/2, infty) cap (0, 2) = (1/2, 2) ), which is non-empty.Therefore, ( a = 1/2 ) is acceptable.Case 4: ( a > 1/2 )Set ( C = (a, infty) )We need ( C cap B neq emptyset ). So, ( (a, infty) cap (0, 2) = (a, 2) ), which is non-empty if ( a < 2 ).Therefore, in Case 4 (( a > 1/2 )), ( C cap B neq emptyset ) if ( a < 2 ).Putting it all together:- For ( -1/2 < a < 1/3 ), ( C cap B neq emptyset )- For ( 1/3 leq a < 2 ), ( C cap B neq emptyset )Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).But wait, in part (1), the range was also ( (-1/2, 2) ). Is that correct?Wait, in part (1), the range was ( (-1/2, 2) ), and in part (2), it's the same. That seems consistent because the conditions are related.But let me check for ( a = -1/2 ):In part (2), ( a = -1/2 ):( f(x) = x(x - (-1/2))(x - (1 - 2*(-1/2))) = x(x + 1/2)(x - (1 + 1)) = x(x + 1/2)(x - 2) )So, ( f(x) = x(x + 1/2)(x - 2) )We need ( f(x) > 0 ). The critical points are ( x = -1/2 ), ( x = 0 ), ( x = 2 ). Since ( x > 0 ), we consider ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2 ).Testing intervals:- ( (0, 2) ): Let me choose ( x = 1 ). ( f(1) = 1*(1 + 1/2)*(1 - 2) = 1*(3/2)*(-1) = -3/2 < 0 )- ( (2, infty) ): Let me choose ( x = 3 ). ( f(3) = 3*(3 + 1/2)*(3 - 2) = 3*(7/2)*(1) = 21/2 > 0 )Therefore, ( C = (2, infty) ). So, ( C cap B = (2, infty) cap (0, 2) = emptyset ). Therefore, ( a = -1/2 ) is excluded.Similarly, for ( a = 2 ):( f(x) = x(x - 2)(x - (1 - 4)) = x(x - 2)(x + 3) )So, ( f(x) = x(x - 2)(x + 3) )We need ( f(x) > 0 ). The critical points are ( x = -3 ), ( x = 0 ), ( x = 2 ). Since ( x > 0 ), we consider ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2 ).Testing intervals:- ( (0, 2) ): Let me choose ( x = 1 ). ( f(1) = 1*(1 - 2)*(1 + 3) = 1*(-1)*(4) = -4 < 0 )- ( (2, infty) ): Let me choose ( x = 3 ). ( f(3) = 3*(3 - 2)*(3 + 3) = 3*(1)*(6) = 18 > 0 )Therefore, ( C = (2, infty) ). So, ( C cap B = (2, infty) cap (0, 2) = emptyset ). Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is excluded.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( (-1/2, 2) ).But wait, in part (1), the range was also ( (-1/2, 2) ). That makes sense because the conditions are related through the quadratic ( g(x) ).Therefore, the final answer for part (2) is ( a ) in ( (-1/2, 2) )."},{"question":"Find the amount in 2 years, with the rate of interest being 4% for the first year and 5% for the second year, if the initial amount is Rs. 4368.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the original function is y = 3 sin(2x + π/4). I know that sine functions have certain properties, like amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift. In this case, the amplitude is 3, which means the graph goes up to 3 and down to -3. The period of a sine function is usually 2π, but when there's a coefficient inside the sine function, like 2x here, it affects the period. The formula for the period is 2π divided by the coefficient of x, so in this case, the period would be 2π/2 = π. That means the function completes one full cycle every π units along the x-axis.Next, there's a phase shift. The general form of a sine function is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B affects the period, C affects the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In our case, C is π/4, so the phase shift is calculated by -C/B. That would be -π/4 divided by 2, which is -π/8. So the graph is shifted π/8 units to the left.Now, the problem says we need to shift this graph to the right by π/6 units. Shifting to the right means adding π/6 to the x-value inside the function. So, if the original function is y = 3 sin(2x + π/4), shifting it to the right by π/6 would involve replacing x with (x - π/6). Let me write that out:y = 3 sin(2(x - π/6) + π/4)Let me simplify the inside of the sine function:2(x - π/6) + π/4 = 2x - 2*(π/6) + π/4 = 2x - π/3 + π/4Now, to combine the constants, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 3 and 4, so the least common denominator is 12.-π/3 is equal to -4π/12, and π/4 is equal to 3π/12. So:2x - 4π/12 + 3π/12 = 2x - π/12So the shifted function becomes:y = 3 sin(2x - π/12)Alright, so now the function is y = 3 sin(2x - π/12). I need to find the equation of the axis of symmetry closest to the y-axis in this shifted graph.I remember that the axis of symmetry for a sine function occurs at the maximum and minimum points. For a standard sine function y = sin(x), the maximum occurs at π/2 and the minimum at 3π/2, and these are points where the function reaches its peak and trough. The axis of symmetry would be the vertical lines passing through these points.But in our case, the function is y = 3 sin(2x - π/12). So, to find the axis of symmetry, I need to find the x-values where the function reaches its maximum and minimum.The general form for the maximum and minimum of a sine function y = A sin(Bx + C) + D is when the argument of the sine function is equal to π/2 + 2πk for maxima and 3π/2 + 2πk for minima, where k is any integer.So, for our function, we set the argument equal to π/2 + 2πk and 3π/2 + 2πk.Let me write that out:2x - π/12 = π/2 + 2πkand2x - π/12 = 3π/2 + 2πkSolving for x in both cases will give me the x-values where the function has maxima and minima, which are the axes of symmetry.Let's solve the first equation:2x - π/12 = π/2 + 2πkAdding π/12 to both sides:2x = π/2 + π/12 + 2πkTo combine π/2 and π/12, I need a common denominator, which is 12.π/2 = 6π/12, so:2x = 6π/12 + π/12 + 2πk = 7π/12 + 2πkDividing both sides by 2:x = 7π/24 + πkSimilarly, solving the second equation:2x - π/12 = 3π/2 + 2πkAdding π/12 to both sides:2x = 3π/2 + π/12 + 2πkConvert 3π/2 to 18π/12:2x = 18π/12 + π/12 + 2πk = 19π/12 + 2πkDividing both sides by 2:x = 19π/24 + πkSo, the axes of symmetry are at x = 7π/24 + πk and x = 19π/24 + πk for any integer k.Now, I need to find the axis of symmetry closest to the y-axis, which is x = 0. So, I need to find the x-values from the above expressions that are closest to 0.Let me list out some values for different k:For x = 7π/24 + πk:- When k = 0: x = 7π/24 ≈ 0.916- When k = -1: x = 7π/24 - π = 7π/24 - 24π/24 = -17π/24 ≈ -2.244- When k = 1: x = 7π/24 + π = 7π/24 + 24π/24 = 31π/24 ≈ 4.084For x = 19π/24 + πk:- When k = 0: x = 19π/24 ≈ 2.513- When k = -1: x = 19π/24 - π = 19π/24 - 24π/24 = -5π/24 ≈ -0.654- When k = 1: x = 19π/24 + π = 19π/24 + 24π/24 = 43π/24 ≈ 5.654Now, let's see which of these x-values are closest to 0.Looking at the negative k values:From x = 7π/24 + πk:- k = -1: x ≈ -2.244From x = 19π/24 + πk:- k = -1: x ≈ -0.654From x = 7π/24 + πk with k = 0: x ≈ 0.916From x = 19π/24 + πk with k = 0: x ≈ 2.513So, the closest x-values to 0 are approximately -0.654 and 0.916.Comparing these two, -0.654 is closer to 0 than 0.916 because 0.654 < 0.916.Therefore, the axis of symmetry closest to the y-axis is at x = -5π/24.Wait, let me check that.When k = -1 for x = 19π/24 + πk:x = 19π/24 - π = 19π/24 - 24π/24 = -5π/24 ≈ -0.654Yes, that's correct.So, the equation of the axis of symmetry closest to the y-axis is x = -5π/24.I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.Starting from the shifted function y = 3 sin(2x - π/12), setting the argument equal to π/2 + 2πk and 3π/2 + 2πk, solving for x, and then finding the closest x to 0.Yes, the calculations seem correct. So, the closest axis of symmetry is at x = -5π/24."},{"question":"What is the sum of the second largest and second smallest odd numbers from 1 to 15?","answer":"First, I need to identify all the odd numbers between 1 and 15.

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and AM is the median from A to BC, which means M is the midpoint of BC. So, BM equals MC. Now, on this median AM, there's a point K such that the ratio of AK to KM is 1:3. That means AK is one part, and KM is three parts. So, if I imagine the median AM, K is closer to A than to M.The question is asking about a line that passes through K and is parallel to side AC. This line will intersect side BC at some point, let's call it N. We need to find the ratio in which this point N divides BC, so essentially, we need to find BN:NC.Hmm, okay. So, since the line KN is parallel to AC, maybe I can use some properties of similar triangles here. I remember that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally. That's the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem.Let me recall the theorem: If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. So, in this case, if KN is parallel to AC, then it should divide AB and BC proportionally. Wait, but KN is drawn from K on the median AM, so it might not intersect AB. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to solve this problem. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). Then, the midpoint M of BC would be at ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d).Now, the median AM goes from A(0,0) to M(b + c, d). The point K divides AM in the ratio AK:KM = 1:3. So, using the section formula, the coordinates of K can be found. The section formula says that if a point divides a line segment joining (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates of the point are ((mx2 + nx1)/(m + n), (my2 + ny1)/(m + n)).Applying this, K divides AM in the ratio 1:3, so m = 1, n = 3. Therefore, the coordinates of K are ((1*(b + c) + 3*0)/(1 + 3), (1*d + 3*0)/(1 + 3)) = ((b + c)/4, d/4).Now, the line KN is parallel to AC. Let's find the equation of AC first. Point A is at (0,0) and point C is at (2c, 2d). The slope of AC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 0) = d/c. Since KN is parallel to AC, it will have the same slope, d/c.Point K is at ((b + c)/4, d/4). So, the equation of line KN is y - d/4 = (d/c)(x - (b + c)/4).This line intersects BC at point N. Let's find the coordinates of point N. First, let's find the equation of BC. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b).So, the equation of BC is y - 0 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b), which simplifies to y = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b).Now, to find point N, we need to solve the two equations: the equation of KN and the equation of BC.Equation of KN: y = (d/c)(x - (b + c)/4) + d/4.Let me simplify that:y = (d/c)x - (d/c)*(b + c)/4 + d/4= (d/c)x - (d(b + c))/(4c) + d/4= (d/c)x - (db + dc)/(4c) + d/4= (d/c)x - db/(4c) - dc/(4c) + d/4= (d/c)x - b/(4) - d/(4) + d/4= (d/c)x - b/4So, equation of KN is y = (d/c)x - b/4.Equation of BC is y = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b).Set them equal to find x-coordinate of N:(d/c)x - b/4 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b)Let me solve for x:Multiply both sides by 4c(c - b) to eliminate denominators:4c(c - b)*(d/c)x - 4c(c - b)*(b/4) = 4c(c - b)*(d/(c - b))(x - 2b)Simplify term by term:First term: 4c(c - b)*(d/c)x = 4d(c - b)xSecond term: -4c(c - b)*(b/4) = -c(c - b)bThird term: 4c(c - b)*(d/(c - b))(x - 2b) = 4c d (x - 2b)So, the equation becomes:4d(c - b)x - c(c - b)b = 4c d (x - 2b)Let me expand the right side:4c d x - 8c d bNow, bring all terms to the left side:4d(c - b)x - c(c - b)b - 4c d x + 8c d b = 0Factor terms:4d(c - b)x - 4c d x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0Factor x terms:4d(c - b - c)x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0Simplify inside the brackets:4d(-b)x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0So,-4d b x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0Let me rearrange:-4d b x = c(c - b)b - 8c d bFactor out c b on the right:-4d b x = c b [ (c - b) - 8d ]Wait, that might not be helpful. Let me instead solve for x:-4d b x = c(c - b)b - 8c d bDivide both sides by -4d b:x = [ -c(c - b)b + 8c d b ] / (4d b)Factor numerator:= [ -c b (c - b) + 8c d b ] / (4d b)Factor c b:= c b [ - (c - b) + 8d ] / (4d b)Cancel b:= c [ - (c - b) + 8d ] / (4d )Simplify inside the brackets:= c [ -c + b + 8d ] / (4d )Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra somewhere. Let me check my steps.Wait, perhaps using coordinate geometry is making this more complex. Maybe I should try a different approach, like mass point geometry or using similar triangles.Let me think about similar triangles. Since KN is parallel to AC, triangle KBN is similar to triangle ABC. Wait, is that correct? Let me see.Actually, since KN is parallel to AC, the triangles KBN and ABC are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem. So, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal.But wait, K is on the median AM, so maybe I need to find the ratio in which K divides AM and then use that to find the ratio in which N divides BC.Given that AK:KM = 1:3, so AK is 1 part and KM is 3 parts. Therefore, the total length of AM is 4 parts.Since M is the midpoint of BC, BM = MC. So, if I can find how KN divides BC, I can find the ratio BN:NC.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors. Let me try that.Let me assign vectors to the points. Let me take point A as the origin. So, vector A is (0,0). Let me denote vector AB as vector b and vector AC as vector c.Then, point B is at vector b, point C is at vector c, and point M, being the midpoint of BC, is at (b + c)/2.Point K is on AM such that AK:KM = 1:3. So, vector AK = (1/4) vector AM. Since vector AM is (b + c)/2, vector AK is (1/4)*(b + c)/2 = (b + c)/8.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, if AK:KM = 1:3, then AK is 1/4 of AM. So, vector AK = (1/4)*vector AM = (1/4)*(b + c)/2 = (b + c)/8.Wait, that seems too small. Maybe I'm miscalculating.Wait, vector AM is from A to M, which is (b + c)/2. So, if AK is 1/4 of AM, then vector AK = (1/4)*(b + c)/2 = (b + c)/8. So, point K is at (b + c)/8.Now, the line KN is parallel to AC. So, vector KN is parallel to vector AC, which is vector c. So, vector KN = k*c for some scalar k.Since point K is at (b + c)/8, and point N is on BC, which can be parametrized as point B + t*(C - B) = b + t*(c - b), where t is between 0 and 1.So, vector KN = N - K = [b + t*(c - b)] - [(b + c)/8] = b + t c - t b - b/8 - c/8 = (1 - t - 1/8)b + (t - 1/8)c.Since vector KN is parallel to vector c, the coefficient of b must be zero. So,1 - t - 1/8 = 0Solving for t:1 - 1/8 = tt = 7/8Therefore, point N is at b + (7/8)(c - b) = b + (7/8)c - (7/8)b = (1 - 7/8)b + (7/8)c = (1/8)b + (7/8)c.So, point N divides BC in the ratio BN:NC. Since N is closer to B, we can find the ratio.The coordinates of N are (1/8)b + (7/8)c. So, the ratio BN:NC is 7:1.Wait, that seems different from my earlier thought. Let me verify.If t = 7/8, then N divides BC such that BN = 7/8 of BC and NC = 1/8 of BC. Therefore, the ratio BN:NC is 7:1.But earlier, I thought it might be 1:7. Hmm, which one is correct?Wait, in the coordinate approach, I found that N is closer to B, so BN is longer than NC. So, BN:NC = 7:1.But in the initial problem, the line through K parallel to AC divides BC. So, if K is closer to A, the line should intersect BC closer to B, making BN longer than NC, so the ratio BN:NC is 7:1.Wait, but in the first approach, I thought it might be 1:7, but that was a mistake. The correct ratio is 7:1.Wait, but let me double-check using mass point geometry.Mass point assigns weights to the vertices based on the ratios. Since AK:KM = 1:3, the mass at A is 3 and at M is 1. Since M is the midpoint of BC, masses at B and C are equal, say 1 each. Therefore, mass at M is 1 + 1 = 2. But earlier, mass at M was 1, so we need to adjust.Wait, mass point might not be the best approach here because the ratios are not directly along the sides but along the median.Alternatively, using Menelaus' theorem. Let's apply Menelaus' theorem to triangle ABC with the transversal KN.Menelaus' theorem states that (BN/NC)*(CM/MA)*(AK/KB) = 1.Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formulation here. Maybe I need to adjust.Alternatively, since KN is parallel to AC, the ratio BN/NC should be equal to BK/KA.Wait, that's from the Basic Proportionality Theorem. So, if a line parallel to one side intersects the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally.But in this case, KN is parallel to AC and intersects BC at N and AM at K. So, the ratio BN/NC should be equal to BK/KA.Wait, but BK is along BM, which is the median. Hmm, maybe I need to express BK in terms of BM.Wait, since M is the midpoint of BC, BM = MC. So, if I can find the ratio BK/KA, that would give me BN/NC.Given that AK:KM = 1:3, so AK = 1 part, KM = 3 parts. Therefore, the total AM = 4 parts.Since M is the midpoint, BM = MC. So, if I can find the ratio of BK to KA, which is along BM and AM.Wait, maybe I need to use similar triangles.Since KN is parallel to AC, triangle KBN is similar to triangle ABC.Wait, no, because KN is not necessarily cutting AB, but cutting BC and AM.Wait, perhaps triangle KBN is similar to triangle ACM.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently.Since KN is parallel to AC, the ratio of BN to NC is equal to the ratio of BK to KA.Wait, that might be the case. So, BN/NC = BK/KA.Given that AK:KM = 1:3, so AK = 1, KM = 3. Therefore, the total AM = 4.Since M is the midpoint, BM = MC.Now, point K divides AM into AK:KM = 1:3. So, from A, K is 1/4 of the way to M.Therefore, the ratio BK/KA would be?Wait, BK is along BM, which is half of BC. But K is on AM, not on BM.Hmm, maybe I need to use coordinates again.Wait, earlier, using coordinates, I found that BN:NC = 7:1. So, that should be the correct ratio.But let me try to confirm using similar triangles.Since KN is parallel to AC, angle KBN is equal to angle BAC, and angle BKN is equal to angle BCA. Therefore, triangles KBN and ABC are similar.Wait, but that would mean that the ratio of sides is preserved. So, BN/BC = BK/AB.But I don't know BK or AB. Hmm.Alternatively, since KN is parallel to AC, the ratio of BN to NC is equal to the ratio of BK to KA.Wait, that seems to be the case from the Basic Proportionality Theorem.So, BN/NC = BK/KA.Given that AK:KM = 1:3, so AK = 1, KM = 3. Therefore, the total AM = 4.Now, BK is the segment from B to K. Since K is on AM, which is the median, we need to find the ratio BK/KA.Wait, but BK is not along the same line as KA. So, maybe I need to express BK in terms of BM and MK.Wait, since M is the midpoint, BM = MC. Let me denote BM = MC = m.Now, K is on AM such that AK:KM = 1:3. So, AK = (1/4)AM, and KM = (3/4)AM.But AM is the median, so its length can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle, but maybe that's complicating things.Alternatively, using vectors again, I found that BN:NC = 7:1.Wait, let me think about the area ratios. Since KN is parallel to AC, the area of triangle KBN is proportional to the square of the ratio of sides.But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles in terms of the medians.Since KN is parallel to AC, and K is on the median AM, the ratio in which N divides BC should be related to the ratio in which K divides AM.Given that AK:KM = 1:3, so K divides AM in the ratio 1:3.Therefore, the ratio BN:NC should be equal to the ratio of BK to KA.But BK is along BM, which is half of BC, and KA is along AM.Wait, maybe I need to use the concept of similar triangles in terms of the medians.Alternatively, let me consider the coordinates approach again.Earlier, I found that N divides BC in the ratio BN:NC = 7:1.So, perhaps that's the correct answer.Wait, but let me think about it differently. If K is closer to A, then the line KN parallel to AC should intersect BC closer to B, making BN longer than NC. So, the ratio BN:NC should be greater than 1.In the coordinate approach, I found it to be 7:1, which makes sense.Alternatively, using the section formula, since K divides AM in the ratio 1:3, and KN is parallel to AC, the ratio BN:NC should be 3:1. Wait, that contradicts the coordinate result.Wait, maybe I'm confusing the ratios.Wait, in the Basic Proportionality Theorem, if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.In this case, KN is parallel to AC, so it should divide AB and BC proportionally. But KN doesn't intersect AB, it intersects AM.Wait, so maybe the theorem doesn't apply directly here.Alternatively, maybe I can extend KN to intersect AB at some point, say P, and then apply the theorem.But that might complicate things.Wait, let me try to use the concept of similar triangles.Since KN is parallel to AC, triangle KBN is similar to triangle ABC.Wait, no, because KN is not cutting AB, but cutting BC and AM.Wait, maybe triangle KBN is similar to triangle ACM.Wait, let me see.Since KN is parallel to AC, angle KBN is equal to angle BAC, and angle BKN is equal to angle BCA.Therefore, triangle KBN is similar to triangle ABC.Wait, but that would mean that the ratio of sides is preserved.So, BN/BC = BK/AB.But I don't know BK or AB.Alternatively, since K is on AM, which is the median, maybe I can express BK in terms of BM and MK.Wait, BM is half of BC, so BM = BC/2.But K is on AM, so BK is not along BM, but from B to K.Hmm, this is getting complicated.Wait, going back to the coordinate approach, I think that was more straightforward and gave me BN:NC = 7:1.So, perhaps that's the correct answer.Alternatively, let me try to use the concept of ratios in medians.Since K divides AM in the ratio 1:3, so AK:KM = 1:3.Therefore, the ratio of AK to AM is 1:4.Now, since KN is parallel to AC, the ratio in which N divides BC should be equal to the ratio in which K divides AM.Wait, but that might not be directly applicable.Wait, in similar triangles, the ratio of division is preserved.So, if AK:AM = 1:4, then BN:BC should be 1:4, making BN = BC/4 and NC = 3BC/4, so BN:NC = 1:3.But that contradicts the coordinate result.Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the ratios.Wait, in the coordinate approach, I found that N divides BC such that BN = 7/8 BC and NC = 1/8 BC, so BN:NC = 7:1.But that seems too large.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate calculation.Let me go back to the coordinate approach.I set A at (0,0), B at (2b,0), C at (2c,2d), M at (b + c, d).Point K is on AM such that AK:KM = 1:3, so K is at ((b + c)/4, d/4).Equation of KN: y = (d/c)x - b/4.Equation of BC: y = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b).Setting them equal:(d/c)x - b/4 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2b)Multiply both sides by 4c(c - b):4d(c - b)x - c(c - b)b = 4c d (x - 2b)Expanding:4d(c - b)x - c(c - b)b = 4c d x - 8c d bBring all terms to left:4d(c - b)x - c(c - b)b - 4c d x + 8c d b = 0Factor x terms:4d(c - b - c)x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0Simplify:4d(-b)x - c(c - b)b + 8c d b = 0So,-4d b x = c(c - b)b - 8c d bDivide both sides by -4d b:x = [ -c(c - b)b + 8c d b ] / (4d b)Factor numerator:= [ -c b (c - b) + 8c d b ] / (4d b)Factor c b:= c b [ - (c - b) + 8d ] / (4d b)Cancel b:= c [ - (c - b) + 8d ] / (4d )Simplify inside the brackets:= c [ -c + b + 8d ] / (4d )Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the coordinates.Alternatively, let me choose specific coordinates to simplify the problem.Let me set A at (0,0), B at (4,0), and C at (0,4). Then, M, the midpoint of BC, is at ((4 + 0)/2, (0 + 4)/2) = (2,2).Now, point K divides AM in the ratio AK:KM = 1:3. So, from A(0,0) to M(2,2), K is 1/4 of the way.So, coordinates of K are ((1*2 + 3*0)/4, (1*2 + 3*0)/4) = (0.5, 0.5).Now, the line KN is parallel to AC. AC goes from (0,0) to (0,4), which is a vertical line. So, KN should also be vertical.Since K is at (0.5, 0.5), a vertical line through K would be x = 0.5.This line intersects BC at point N. Let's find the equation of BC.Points B(4,0) and C(0,4). The equation of BC is y = -x + 4.So, x = 0.5 intersects BC at y = -0.5 + 4 = 3.5.Therefore, point N is at (0.5, 3.5).Now, let's find the ratio BN:NC.Point B is at (4,0), N at (0.5, 3.5), and C at (0,4).Calculate the distance from B to N and from N to C.But since BC is a straight line, we can use the parameter t such that N divides BC in the ratio t:(1 - t).Alternatively, since BC is from (4,0) to (0,4), the vector from B to C is (-4,4). Point N is at (0.5, 3.5), which is 4 - 3.5 = 0.5 units from C in the x-direction, but that's not helpful.Wait, let's calculate the ratio using coordinates.The x-coordinate of N is 0.5, which is between 4 and 0. The distance from B to N in x-direction is 4 - 0.5 = 3.5, and from N to C is 0.5 - 0 = 0.5. So, the ratio BN:NC in x-direction is 3.5:0.5 = 7:1.Similarly, in y-direction, from B(0) to N(3.5) is 3.5, and from N(3.5) to C(4) is 0.5, so again 3.5:0.5 = 7:1.Therefore, the ratio BN:NC is 7:1.So, the line through K parallel to AC divides BC in the ratio 7:1.Wait, that's consistent with the coordinate approach earlier.So, the answer should be 7:1.But earlier, I thought it might be 1:7, but that was a mistake.So, the correct ratio is BN:NC = 7:1."},{"question":"Given ( n (n geq 4) ) distinct real numbers ( x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} ) that satisfy:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}=0, quad sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}=1 ]","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about some real numbers. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. The problem states that we have n distinct real numbers, where n is at least 4. These numbers are x₁, x₂, up to xₙ. They satisfy two conditions: the sum of all these numbers is zero, and the sum of their squares is one. So, mathematically, that's:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = 0]and[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} = 1]Got that. Now, the problem wants me to prove that among these numbers, there exist four distinct ones, let's call them a, b, c, d, such that:[a + b + c + nabc leq sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{3} leq a + b + d + nabd]Hmm, okay. So, I need to find four specific numbers in this set that bound the sum of the cubes of all the numbers. Interesting.First, I should probably recall some properties of sums and cubes. Maybe there's a way to relate the sum of cubes to the sum and the sum of squares. I remember that for any real numbers, the sum of cubes can be expressed in terms of the sum, the sum of squares, and the sum of products. But I'm not sure exactly how that applies here.Wait, the problem mentions a function involving a cubic polynomial. It says:[(x - u)(x - v)(x - w) = x^{3} - (u + v + w)x^{2} + (uv + vw + wu)x - uvw]Where u, v, w are three distinct numbers from the set. Then, it suggests substituting x with each x_i and summing over i. Let me try to unpack that.If I take each x_i and plug it into the cubic polynomial, I get:[(x_i - u)(x_i - v)(x_i - w) = x_i^{3} - (u + v + w)x_i^{2} + (uv + vw + wu)x_i - uvw]Then, if I sum this over all i from 1 to n, I get:[sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - u)(x_i - v)(x_i - w) = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} - (u + v + w)sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{2} + (uv + vw + wu)sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - nuvw]Oh, that's a bit involved. Let me break it down term by term.First, the sum of x_i³ is exactly what we're trying to relate, so that's good. Then, we have -(u + v + w) times the sum of x_i². We know that sum is 1, so that simplifies to -(u + v + w). Next, we have (uv + vw + wu) times the sum of x_i, which is zero, so that whole term drops out. Finally, we have -n times uvw.Putting it all together, we get:[sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - u)(x_i - v)(x_i - w) = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} - (u + v + w) - nuvw]So, rearranging this, we can express the sum of cubes as:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - u)(x_i - v)(x_i - w) + (u + v + w) + nuvw]Interesting. So, the sum of cubes can be written in terms of this cubic polynomial evaluated at each x_i, plus some terms involving u, v, w.Now, the problem suggests choosing specific values for u, v, w. It says to assume that the numbers are ordered, so x₁ < x₂ < ... < xₙ. Then, it selects a = x₁, b = xₙ, c = x_{n-1}, d = x₂. So, a is the smallest, b is the largest, c is the second largest, and d is the second smallest.Then, it says to apply the previous equation with (u, v, w) = (a, b, c) and (a, b, d). Let me see what that gives us.First, let's take (u, v, w) = (a, b, c). Then, plugging into the equation:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - c) + (a + b + c) + nabc]Similarly, for (u, v, w) = (a, b, d):[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - d) + (a + b + d) + nabd]Now, the problem states that these two expressions provide bounds for the sum of cubes. Specifically:[a + b + c + nabc leq sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} leq a + b + d + nabd]Wait, how does that follow? Let me think.Looking back at the expressions, we have:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - c) + (a + b + c) + nabc]and[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - d) + (a + b + d) + nabd]So, if I can show that the first expression is less than or equal to the sum of cubes, and the second expression is greater than or equal to the sum of cubes, then I get the desired inequality.But wait, actually, both expressions equal the sum of cubes. So, how does that give us the inequality? Maybe I'm missing something.Perhaps the key is to analyze the terms (sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - c)) and (sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - d)). Maybe one of these sums is non-positive and the other is non-negative, which would allow us to bound the sum of cubes.Let me think about the sign of these sums. Since a is the smallest and b is the largest, for each x_i, (x_i - a) is non-negative because x_i ≥ a. Similarly, (x_i - b) is non-positive because x_i ≤ b. So, (x_i - a)(x_i - b) is non-positive for all i.Now, when we multiply by (x_i - c), which is the third term, we need to consider the sign. c is the second largest, so for x_i ≤ c, (x_i - c) is non-positive, and for x_i > c, it's positive. But since c is the second largest, only x_{n} is greater than c, which is b. Wait, no, c is x_{n-1}, so x_n is greater than c.So, for i = n, x_n - c is positive, and for all other i, x_i - c is less than or equal to zero. So, the term (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - c) is positive only when x_i = x_n, because that's the only term where (x_i - c) is positive, and (x_i - a)(x_i - b) is negative, so overall, it's negative times positive, which is negative.Wait, no, let's see. For x_n, (x_n - a) is positive, (x_n - b) is zero because b = x_n, so actually, (x_n - b) = 0. So, the term for i = n is zero. For i = n-1, which is c, (x_{n-1} - a) is positive, (x_{n-1} - b) is negative, and (x_{n-1} - c) is zero. So, that term is also zero.For i < n-1, (x_i - a) is positive, (x_i - b) is negative, and (x_i - c) is negative. So, positive times negative times negative is positive. Therefore, the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - c)) is positive for i < n-1, zero for i = n-1 and i = n.Similarly, for (u, v, w) = (a, b, d), where d = x₂, which is the second smallest. Let's analyze the sign of (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - d).For x_i = a, which is x₁, (x₁ - a) = 0, so that term is zero. For x_i = d, which is x₂, (x₂ - d) = 0, so that term is zero. For x_i > d, which is all i ≥ 3, (x_i - a) is positive, (x_i - b) is negative, and (x_i - d) is positive. So, positive times negative times positive is negative. For x_i < d, which is x₁ and x₂, but x₁ is a, which we already considered, and x₂ is d, which is zero.So, the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)(x_i - b)(x_i - d)) is negative for i ≥ 3, zero for i = 1 and i = 2.Therefore, going back to the expressions:For (u, v, w) = (a, b, c):[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = text{Positive sum} + (a + b + c) + nabc]So, since the positive sum is added, we have:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} geq (a + b + c) + nabc]Similarly, for (u, v, w) = (a, b, d):[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} = text{Negative sum} + (a + b + d) + nabd]Since the negative sum is subtracted, we have:[sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} leq (a + b + d) + nabd]Putting these together, we get:[a + b + c + nabc leq sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{3} leq a + b + d + nabd]Which is exactly what we needed to prove. So, by choosing a, b, c, d as the smallest, largest, second largest, and second smallest numbers respectively, we can bound the sum of cubes.I think that makes sense. The key was to look at the cubic polynomial and how it behaves when evaluated at each x_i, especially considering the ordering of the numbers. By analyzing the signs of the terms, we could determine whether the sum would be positive or negative, which allowed us to establish the inequalities."},{"question":"Akeno spent 2985 to furnish his apartment. Lev spent one-third of that amount on his apartment and Ambrocio spent 177 less than Lev. How many dollars more did Akeno spend than the other 2 people combined?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where Akeno spent 2985 to furnish his apartment. Lev spent one-third of that amount on his apartment, and Ambrocio spent 177 less than Lev. I need to figure out how many dollars more Akeno spent than the other two people combined.Alright, let's start by understanding what each person spent. Akeno's expenditure is straightforward—it's 2985. Now, Lev spent one-third of that amount. So, I need to calculate one-third of 2985. To do that, I can divide 2985 by 3. Let me write that down:Lev's expenditure = 2985 ÷ 3Hmm, let's do the division. 3 goes into 29 eight times (since 3 × 9 is 27, which is less than 29), with a remainder of 2. Then, bring down the 8 to make 28. 3 goes into 28 nine times (3 × 9 = 27), with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 5 to make 15. 3 goes into 15 exactly 5 times. So, putting it all together, Lev spent 995.Okay, so Lev spent 995. Now, Ambrocio spent 177 less than Lev. So, I need to subtract 177 from Lev's expenditure to find out how much Ambrocio spent. Let's do that:Ambrocio's expenditure = Lev's expenditure - 177 = 995 - 177Let me calculate that. 995 minus 177. Starting from the units place: 5 minus 7, I can't do that, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The 9 in the tens place becomes 8, and the 5 becomes 15. 15 minus 7 is 8. Now, the tens place: 8 minus 7 is 1. The hundreds place: 9 minus 1 is 8. So, Ambrocio spent 818.Alright, so Lev spent 995 and Ambrocio spent 818. Now, I need to find out how much more Akeno spent than the combined total of Lev and Ambrocio. So, first, I'll add Lev's and Ambrocio's expenditures together:Total expenditure of Lev and Ambrocio = Lev's expenditure + Ambrocio's expenditure = 995 + 818Let's add those two amounts. 995 plus 818. Starting from the units place: 5 plus 8 is 13. I'll write down 3 and carry over 1. Next, the tens place: 9 plus 1 is 10, plus the carried over 1 makes 11. I'll write down 1 and carry over 1. Finally, the hundreds place: 9 plus 8 is 17, plus the carried over 1 makes 18. So, the total is 1813.Now, Akeno spent 2985, and the combined expenditure of Lev and Ambrocio is 1813. To find out how much more Akeno spent, I'll subtract the total of Lev and Ambrocio from Akeno's expenditure:Akeno's extra expenditure = Akeno's expenditure - Total expenditure of Lev and Ambrocio = 2985 - 1813Let's do that subtraction. 2985 minus 1813. Starting from the units place: 5 minus 3 is 2. Tens place: 8 minus 1 is 7. Hundreds place: 9 minus 8 is 1. Thousands place: 2 minus 1 is 1. So, the result is 1172.Therefore, Akeno spent 1172 more than Lev and Ambrocio combined."},{"question":"Given that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are both unit vectors, which of the following statements is true?A: overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{0}B: overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 1C: overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0D: |overrightarrow{a}| = |overrightarrow{b}|","answer":"Alright, so I've got this question here about vectors, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read it again:\\"Given that vector a and vector b are both unit vectors, which of the following statements is true?A: vector a minus vector b equals the zero vector.B: the dot product of vector a and vector b equals 1.C: the dot product of vector a and vector b equals 0.D: the magnitude of vector a equals the magnitude of vector b.\\"Okay, so both vectors are unit vectors. I remember that a unit vector has a magnitude of 1. So, |vector a| = 1 and |vector b| = 1. That seems straightforward.Let's look at each option one by one.Option A: vector a minus vector b equals the zero vector. Hmm, so that would mean vector a equals vector b, right? Because if you subtract them and get zero, they must be the same vector. But wait, are all unit vectors the same? No, unit vectors can point in different directions. For example, the unit vector along the x-axis is (1,0), and the unit vector along the y-axis is (0,1). If I subtract those, I get (1,0) - (0,1) = (1,-1), which is definitely not the zero vector. So, option A isn't necessarily true.Option B: the dot product of vector a and vector b equals 1. The dot product formula is |a||b|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. Since both are unit vectors, |a| and |b| are 1, so the dot product simplifies to cos(theta). For the dot product to be 1, cos(theta) must be 1, which means theta is 0 degrees. That would mean the vectors are pointing in the same direction. But vectors can be at any angle, not necessarily 0 degrees. So, unless they're in the same direction, the dot product won't be 1. So, option B isn't always true.Option C: the dot product of vector a and vector b equals 0. Using the same formula, cos(theta) would have to be 0, which means theta is 90 degrees. That would make them perpendicular. But again, vectors can be at any angle, not necessarily 90 degrees. So, the dot product isn't always 0. So, option C isn't necessarily true either.Option D: the magnitude of vector a equals the magnitude of vector b. Well, both are unit vectors, so by definition, their magnitudes are 1. Therefore, |vector a| = |vector b| = 1. This seems to be always true.So, putting it all together, options A, B, and C depend on the specific directions of the vectors, but since they're just given as unit vectors without any additional information, only option D is definitely true."},{"question":"Let mathbf{C} and mathbf{D} be matrices such that[mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} = mathbf{C} mathbf{D}.]If mathbf{C} mathbf{D} = begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}, find mathbf{D} mathbf{C}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two matrices, C and D. The equation provided is C + D = CD, and I know that CD is equal to the matrix (begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}). I need to find DC. Hmm, interesting. I remember that matrix multiplication isn't commutative, so DC might not be the same as CD. But let's see if I can figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what I know:1. C + D = CD2. CD = (begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix})I need to find DC. So, maybe I can manipulate the first equation to express DC in terms of CD or something else.Starting with the equation C + D = CD. Let me rearrange this equation to see if I can factor it or find a relationship between C and D.Subtracting C and D from both sides, I get:CD - C - D = 0Hmm, that looks a bit like something I can factor. Let me try adding the identity matrix I to both sides to see if that helps:CD - C - D + I = INow, can I factor the left side? Let me see. If I factor C from the first two terms and D from the next two terms, does that work?Wait, let's try:(C - I)(D - I) = IIs that correct? Let me check by expanding the left side:(C - I)(D - I) = CD - C - D + IYes, that's exactly what we have on the left side. So, indeed, (C - I)(D - I) = I.This means that (C - I) and (D - I) are inverses of each other because their product is the identity matrix. So, (C - I) is the inverse of (D - I), and vice versa.Therefore, (D - I)(C - I) should also equal the identity matrix I. Let me write that down:(D - I)(C - I) = INow, let's expand this product to see what we get:DC - D - C + I = ISubtracting I from both sides gives:DC - D - C = 0Which simplifies to:DC = D + CBut from the original equation, we know that C + D = CD. So, substituting that into the equation above:DC = CDWait, that's interesting. So, DC equals CD? But CD is given as (begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}). So, does that mean DC is also equal to that matrix?Let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in my reasoning. So, starting from (C - I)(D - I) = I, which implies that (D - I) is the inverse of (C - I). Therefore, (D - I)(C - I) should also equal I, which we expanded to DC - D - C + I = I, leading to DC = D + C.But from the original equation, C + D = CD, so DC = CD. Therefore, DC must equal CD, which is given. So, DC is equal to (begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}).Wait, but I thought matrix multiplication isn't commutative. Is there something special about these matrices that makes CD and DC equal? Maybe because of the specific relationship given by C + D = CD, it forces DC to be equal to CD.Let me double-check my steps:1. Started with C + D = CD.2. Subtracted C and D to get CD - C - D = 0.3. Added I to both sides: CD - C - D + I = I.4. Factored the left side as (C - I)(D - I) = I.5. Concluded that (C - I) and (D - I) are inverses.6. Therefore, (D - I)(C - I) = I.7. Expanded this to DC - D - C + I = I, simplifying to DC = D + C.8. Since C + D = CD, substituted to get DC = CD.So, all the steps seem to follow logically. Therefore, DC must indeed be equal to CD, which is given as (begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}).I think that makes sense. Even though in general matrix multiplication isn't commutative, in this specific case, due to the relationship C + D = CD, it turns out that DC equals CD. So, the answer should be the same matrix as CD.Just to make sure, let me consider if there's another approach. Maybe by assuming specific forms for C and D, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I could think about the properties of matrices that satisfy C + D = CD.Another thought: if (C - I) and (D - I) are inverses, then their product is I, so (C - I)(D - I) = I and (D - I)(C - I) = I. Therefore, both CD and DC are related through these inverses, leading to DC = CD.Yeah, I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that DC is equal to CD, which is the given matrix.**Final Answer**boxed{begin{pmatrix} 10 & 3  -2 & 5 end{pmatrix}}"},{"question":"Eduardo is a teacher.

How many gold coins did the old man have if the difference between the two numbers is 1?","answer":"First, I'll denote the number of gold coins given to the first son as ( x ) and to the second son as ( y ).According to the problem, the difference between the two numbers is 1, so I can write:[ x - y = 1 quad text{(1)} ]The problem also states that the difference between the squares of the two numbers is 25 times the difference between the two numbers. This can be written as:[ x^2 - y^2 = 25(x - y) quad text{(2)} ]I know that ( x^2 - y^2 ) can be factored into ( (x + y)(x - y) ), so I can rewrite equation (2) as:[ (x + y)(x - y) = 25(x - y) ]Since ( x - y = 1 ), I can substitute this into the equation:[ (x + y)(1) = 25(1) ][ x + y = 25 quad text{(3)} ]Now I have two equations:[ x - y = 1 quad text{(1)} ][ x + y = 25 quad text{(3)} ]I can solve these two equations simultaneously.

First he needs to raise the temperature of the candy mixture from 60 degrees to 240 degrees. Then he needs to cool it down to 170 degrees. If the candy heats at 5 degrees/minute and cools at 7 degrees/minute, how long will it take for the candy to be done (in minutes)?","answer":"Okay, so Andy is making fudge, and I need to figure out how long it will take him to finish the process. Let me read the problem again carefully to understand all the steps involved.First, Andy needs to heat the candy mixture from 60 degrees to 240 degrees. Then, after reaching 240 degrees, he needs to cool it down to 170 degrees. The candy heats up at a rate of 5 degrees per minute and cools down at a rate of 7 degrees per minute. I need to calculate the total time it takes for both heating and cooling processes.Alright, let's break this down into two parts: heating and cooling.**Heating Process:**1. **Determine the temperature increase needed:**   The candy starts at 60 degrees and needs to reach 240 degrees. So, the total temperature increase required is:   [   240, text{degrees} - 60, text{degrees} = 180, text{degrees}   ]   2. **Calculate the time to heat:**   The heating rate is 5 degrees per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to increase the temperature by 180 degrees, I'll divide the total temperature increase by the heating rate:   [   frac{180, text{degrees}}{5, text{degrees/minute}} = 36, text{minutes}   ]      So, it takes 36 minutes to heat the candy mixture from 60 degrees to 240 degrees.**Cooling Process:**1. **Determine the temperature decrease needed:**   After reaching 240 degrees, the candy needs to cool down to 170 degrees. The total temperature decrease required is:   [   240, text{degrees} - 170, text{degrees} = 70, text{degrees}   ]   2. **Calculate the time to cool:**   The cooling rate is 7 degrees per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to decrease the temperature by 70 degrees, I'll divide the total temperature decrease by the cooling rate:   [   frac{70, text{degrees}}{7, text{degrees/minute}} = 10, text{minutes}   ]      So, it takes 10 minutes to cool the candy mixture from 240 degrees to 170 degrees.**Total Time:**Now, to find the total time Andy spends on making the fudge, I'll add the time taken for heating and cooling:[36, text{minutes} + 10, text{minutes} = 46, text{minutes}]Therefore, the total time it takes for the candy to be done is 46 minutes.I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.- Heating: 180 degrees at 5 degrees per minute is indeed 36 minutes.- Cooling: 70 degrees at 7 degrees per minute is indeed 10 minutes.- Adding them together gives 46 minutes.Everything seems to add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the total time is 46 minutes."},{"question":"The set T = {1, 2, 3, ldots, 100} contains the first 100 positive integers. After removing all multiples of 3, multiples of 4, and multiples of 5, how many integers remain in the set T?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many integers remain in the set T = {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} after removing all multiples of 3, 4, and 5. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that the set T has 100 integers, right? So, initially, there are 100 numbers. Now, I need to remove all the multiples of 3, 4, and 5. That sounds like I need to count how many numbers are multiples of 3, how many are multiples of 4, and how many are multiples of 5. But wait, if I just add those up, I might be double-counting some numbers because some numbers are multiples of more than one of these numbers. For example, 12 is a multiple of both 3 and 4. So, I need to be careful not to count those twice.I remember something called the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle from math class. It helps in counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by including and excluding overlaps appropriately. Let me try to apply that here.Okay, so let's break it down step by step.First, let's find how many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 100. To find the number of multiples of 3, I can divide 100 by 3 and take the floor of that value. So, 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, and taking the floor gives me 33. So, there are 33 multiples of 3 in T.Next, let's find the number of multiples of 4. Similarly, I'll divide 100 by 4, which gives exactly 25. So, there are 25 multiples of 4 in T.Then, for multiples of 5, dividing 100 by 5 gives exactly 20. So, there are 20 multiples of 5 in T.Now, if I just add these up, 33 + 25 + 20, that gives me 78. But wait, as I thought earlier, some numbers are multiples of more than one of these, so I need to subtract the overlaps.So, the next step is to find the number of numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 4, both 3 and 5, and both 4 and 5. These are the overlaps that have been counted twice in the previous step.To find the number of multiples of both 3 and 4, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4. The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. So, I need to find how many multiples of 12 are there between 1 and 100. Dividing 100 by 12 gives approximately 8.333, and taking the floor gives me 8. So, there are 8 multiples of both 3 and 4.Similarly, for multiples of both 3 and 5, the LCM is 15. Dividing 100 by 15 gives approximately 6.666, and taking the floor gives me 6. So, there are 6 multiples of both 3 and 5.For multiples of both 4 and 5, the LCM is 20. Dividing 100 by 20 gives exactly 5. So, there are 5 multiples of both 4 and 5.Now, if I add these overlaps together, 8 + 6 + 5, that gives me 19. So, I need to subtract these 19 from the previous total of 78 to avoid double-counting. So, 78 - 19 equals 59.But wait, I think I might have gone too far because some numbers are multiples of all three, 3, 4, and 5. These numbers have been subtracted too many times. So, I need to add them back in once.To find the number of multiples of all three, 3, 4, and 5, I need to find the LCM of 3, 4, and 5. The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. Dividing 100 by 60 gives approximately 1.666, and taking the floor gives me 1. So, there is 1 multiple of 60 in T.Therefore, I need to add this 1 back to the previous total. So, 59 + 1 equals 60.So, according to the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the total number of integers that are multiples of 3, 4, or 5 is 60.But wait, the question asks how many integers remain after removing all multiples of 3, 4, and 5. So, I need to subtract this number from the total number of integers in T, which is 100.So, 100 - 60 equals 40.Therefore, the number of integers remaining in set T after removing all multiples of 3, 4, and 5 is 40.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, multiples of 3: 33, multiples of 4: 25, multiples of 5: 20. Total: 78.Subtracting overlaps: multiples of 12: 8, multiples of 15: 6, multiples of 20: 5. Total overlaps: 19. So, 78 - 19 = 59.Adding back multiples of 60: 1. So, 59 + 1 = 60.Subtracting from 100: 100 - 60 = 40.Yeah, that seems correct. I think I got it right."},{"question":"Given f(x)=begin{cases} (2-a)x+1, & x < 1  a^{x}, & xgeqslant 1 end{cases} (a > 0 and aneq 1) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}, then the range of a is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) that's defined piecewise. It's (2 - a)x + 1 when x is less than 1, and a^x when x is greater than or equal to 1. The problem says that f(x) is an increasing function on all real numbers, and I need to find the range of a, given that a is greater than 0 and not equal to 1.Hmm, okay. So, for f(x) to be increasing everywhere, each piece of the function needs to be increasing on its own interval, and also, the function needs to be continuous at the point where the pieces meet, which is at x = 1. Otherwise, there could be a jump discontinuity that might make the function not increasing overall.First, let me consider the left piece: (2 - a)x + 1 for x < 1. This is a linear function, so its slope is (2 - a). For this linear function to be increasing, the slope needs to be positive. That means 2 - a > 0. Solving that, I get a < 2.Next, the right piece: a^x for x >= 1. This is an exponential function. The exponential function a^x is increasing if a > 1 because the base is greater than 1, and it's decreasing if 0 < a < 1. Since the function needs to be increasing overall, a must be greater than 1.So, from the left piece, I have a < 2, and from the right piece, I have a > 1. So, combining these, a must be between 1 and 2. But I also need to make sure that the function is continuous at x = 1, or at least that the right-hand limit at x = 1 is greater than or equal to the left-hand limit. Because if the function jumps down at x = 1, it wouldn't be increasing overall.Let me calculate the left-hand limit as x approaches 1 from the left. That would be (2 - a)(1) + 1 = 2 - a + 1 = 3 - a.Now, the right-hand limit as x approaches 1 from the right is a^1 = a.For the function to be increasing, the right-hand value at x = 1 should be greater than or equal to the left-hand value. So, a >= 3 - a.Let me solve that inequality: a >= 3 - a. Adding a to both sides gives 2a >= 3, so a >= 3/2, which is 1.5.So, putting it all together, a must be greater than or equal to 1.5 and less than 2. That gives me the interval [1.5, 2).Wait, let me double-check that. If a is exactly 1.5, then the left-hand limit at x = 1 is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5, and the right-hand limit is 1.5^1 = 1.5. So, they are equal, which is fine because the function is still non-decreasing.If a is greater than 1.5 but less than 2, say 1.75, then the left-hand limit is 3 - 1.75 = 1.25, and the right-hand limit is 1.75, which is greater. So, that works.If a is exactly 2, the left-hand limit would be 3 - 2 = 1, and the right-hand limit would be 2^1 = 2, which is still greater. But wait, earlier I concluded that a must be less than 2 because the slope of the left piece is 2 - a, which needs to be positive. If a is exactly 2, then the slope would be 0, making the left piece a constant function, not increasing. So, a can't be equal to 2.Therefore, the range of a is from 1.5 to 2, including 1.5 but not including 2. So, in interval notation, that's [1.5, 2).I think that's it. Let me just recap:1. The left piece must have a positive slope: 2 - a > 0 => a < 2.2. The right piece must be increasing: a > 1.3. The function must not decrease at x = 1: a >= 3 - a => a >= 1.5.Combining these, a is in [1.5, 2).Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was ensuring both pieces are increasing and that there's no drop at x = 1.**Final Answer**The range of ( a ) is boxed{left[ dfrac{3}{2}, 2 right)}."},{"question":"The average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old, how many years old is the oldest child?","answer":"To determine the age of the oldest child, I'll start by understanding the information provided. The average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. This means that the total sum of their ages divided by 3 equals 7.Next, I'll calculate the total sum of the children's ages by multiplying the average age by the number of children: 7 years multiplied by 3 children equals 21 years.I know the ages of the two younger children: 4 years and 7 years. Adding these together gives a total of 11 years.To find the age of the oldest child, I'll subtract the combined age of the two younger children from the total sum of all three children's ages: 21 years minus 11 years equals 10 years.Therefore, the oldest child is 10 years old."},{"question":"In the following figure, the bigger wheel has circumference  12 m and the inscribed wheel has circumference  8  m.  P_{1}  denotes a point on the bigger wheel and  P_{2}  denotes a point on the smaller wheel. Initially  P_{1}  and  P_{2}  coincide as in the figure. Now we roll the wheels on a smooth surface and the smaller wheel also rolls in the bigger wheel smoothly. What distance does the bigger wheel have to roll so that the points will be together again?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a bigger wheel and a smaller wheel. The bigger wheel has a circumference of 12 meters, and the smaller one has a circumference of 8 meters. There are points P₁ on the bigger wheel and P₂ on the smaller wheel that start at the same position. I need to figure out how far the bigger wheel has to roll so that P₁ and P₂ meet again.Hmm, let's see. When a wheel rolls without slipping, the distance it rolls is equal to the number of rotations times its circumference. So, if the bigger wheel rolls a certain distance, it will have made that distance divided by 12 rotations. Similarly, the smaller wheel will have made that distance divided by 8 rotations.But wait, the smaller wheel is also rolling inside the bigger wheel. So, does that affect the number of rotations? I think when a wheel rolls inside another wheel, the number of rotations it makes is different. I remember something about the number of rotations being related to the ratio of their circumferences.Let me think. If the smaller wheel is rolling inside the bigger one, the total distance it travels is the same as the distance the bigger wheel rolls, right? So, if the bigger wheel rolls 12 meters, it makes one full rotation. The smaller wheel, having a circumference of 8 meters, would make 12/8 = 1.5 rotations. But since we want the points to meet again, we need both wheels to have made an integer number of rotations.So, I guess I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their circumferences. The LCM of 12 and 8 will give me the smallest distance where both wheels have completed whole numbers of rotations, bringing the points back to their starting positions.To find the LCM, I can break down both numbers into their prime factors. 12 factors into 2^2 * 3, and 8 factors into 2^3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. So, that would be 2^3 * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24.So, the LCM of 12 and 8 is 24. That means after rolling 24 meters, the bigger wheel will have made 24/12 = 2 full rotations, and the smaller wheel will have made 24/8 = 3 full rotations. Both points P₁ and P₂ will be back at their starting positions, so they'll coincide again.Wait, let me double-check. If the bigger wheel rolls 24 meters, it makes 2 rotations. The smaller wheel, rolling inside, would make 24/8 = 3 rotations. Since both numbers are integers, the points should align again. Yeah, that makes sense.I think that's the answer. The distance the bigger wheel needs to roll is 24 meters."},{"question":"If y is some percentage greater than x, then x is 37.5% less than y.

This assumption doesn't affect the final percentage result.Next, I set up the equation based on the given information that ( x ) is 37.5% less than ( y ). This means:[x = y - 0.375y]Substituting ( x = 100 ) into the equation:[100 = 0.625y]Solving for ( y ):[y = frac{100}{0.625} = 160]Now that I have the value of ( y ), I calculate the difference between ( y ) and ( x ):[160 - 100 = 60]To find the percentage increase from ( x ) to ( y ), I divide the difference by the original value ( x ) and multiply by 100:[left( frac{60}{100} right) times 100 = 60%]Therefore, ( y ) is 60% greater than ( x )."},{"question":"Let f(x) = 4x^2 + 6 and assume g(f(5)) = 8 and h(x) = g(x) + 2.

Given that a_{7}+a_{8}+...+a_{11}=35, find the value of S_{17} (  ).A: 117B: 118C: 119D: 120","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to understand what it's asking. It says that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n. Then it gives me that the sum from a_7 to a_11 is 35, and I need to find S_17. The options are A:117, B:118, C:119, D:120.Hmm, arithmetic sequences. I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference. So, the nth term can be written as a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d) or sometimes written as S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2. Yeah, that's right.Now, the problem gives me the sum from a_7 to a_11. That's five terms, right? From term 7 to term 11. So, that's a total of 5 terms. I need to find the sum of these five terms, which is 35.Wait, so a_7 + a_8 + a_9 + a_10 + a_11 = 35. Since it's an arithmetic sequence, these terms are equally spaced. So, maybe I can use the property that the sum of consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence can be expressed in terms of the average term multiplied by the number of terms.Since there are 5 terms, the average term would be the middle one, which is a_9. So, the sum would be 5*a_9 = 35. That means a_9 = 7. Okay, that makes sense.So, a_9 is 7. Now, I need to find S_17, the sum of the first 17 terms. Using the formula for the sum, S_17 = 17/2 * (a_1 + a_17). But I don't know a_1 or a_17 yet.Wait, but in an arithmetic sequence, the terms are equally spaced, so a_17 is the term 8 places after a_9. Let me see: a_9 is the 9th term, so a_17 is the 17th term. So, the difference between a_17 and a_9 is (17 - 9) = 8 terms apart. Since each term increases by d, a_17 = a_9 + 8d.Similarly, a_1 is the first term, which is 8 terms before a_9. So, a_1 = a_9 - 8d.So, if I plug these into the sum formula, S_17 = 17/2 * (a_1 + a_17) = 17/2 * (a_9 - 8d + a_9 + 8d) = 17/2 * (2a_9) = 17*a_9.Oh, that's nice! The d terms cancel out. So, S_17 = 17*a_9.Since we found earlier that a_9 = 7, then S_17 = 17*7 = 119.Let me double-check that. So, the sum from a_7 to a_11 is 35, which is 5*a_9, so a_9 is 7. Then, the sum of the first 17 terms is 17*a_9, which is 119. That seems right.I think that's the answer.

The side edge length is equal to the base edge length, and I need to find the sine of the angle formed by AB₁ and the side face ACC₁A₁. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, a right triangular prism means that the bases are right triangles, and the sides are rectangles. So, ABC is a right triangle, and A₁B₁C₁ is another right triangle directly above it, connected by edges AA₁, BB₁, and CC₁. Since it's a right prism, these side edges are perpendicular to the base.Now, the side edge length is equal to the base edge length. Let me assume that all the edges are of equal length, say, length 'a'. So, each side edge like AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ is length 'a', and each base edge like AB, BC, CA is also length 'a'. Wait, but in a right triangle, the sides can't all be equal unless it's a specific type of triangle. Maybe it's an isosceles right triangle? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. Maybe I need to clarify.Wait, perhaps the base is a right triangle with legs of length 'a', and the hypotenuse would then be a√2. But the side edges are also length 'a'. So, the prism has a right triangle base with legs 'a' and 'a', and height 'a'. That makes sense.So, let me sketch this in my mind. The base triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C, so AC and BC are the legs, each of length 'a', and AB is the hypotenuse of length a√2. Then, the top triangle A₁B₁C₁ is directly above ABC, with each vertex connected by edges of length 'a'.Now, I need to find the sine of the angle formed by AB₁ and the side face ACC₁A₁. Let me parse that. The side face ACC₁A₁ is one of the rectangular faces of the prism. It's the face that includes the edge AC and the corresponding top edge A₁C₁, connected by the vertical edges AA₁ and CC₁.So, the angle formed by the line AB₁ and the face ACC₁A₁. Hmm, how do we define the angle between a line and a plane? I remember that the angle between a line and a plane is the complement of the angle between the line and the normal to the plane. Alternatively, it's the smallest angle between the line and any line on the plane.Wait, actually, the angle between a line and a plane is defined as the angle between the line and its orthogonal projection onto the plane. So, it's the angle between AB₁ and its projection onto the face ACC₁A₁.Alternatively, another method is to find the angle between AB₁ and the normal to the face ACC₁A₁, and then subtract that from 90 degrees to get the angle between AB₁ and the face itself.Maybe both methods can work, but perhaps using vectors would be more straightforward.Let me assign coordinates to the prism to make this easier. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Since ABC is a right triangle with legs AC and BC, let me place point C at (a,0,0) and point B at (0,a,0). Then, the top points would be A₁ at (0,0,a), B₁ at (0,a,a), and C₁ at (a,0,a).So, coordinates:A: (0,0,0)B: (0,a,0)C: (a,0,0)A₁: (0,0,a)B₁: (0,a,a)C₁: (a,0,a)Now, the line AB₁ goes from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a). So, the vector AB₁ is (0,a,a). The side face ACC₁A₁ is the rectangle formed by points A, C, C₁, A₁. So, this face lies in the plane defined by points A(0,0,0), C(a,0,0), and A₁(0,0,a).Wait, actually, points A, C, and A₁ are all in the y=0 plane. So, the face ACC₁A₁ lies in the y=0 plane. Therefore, the normal vector to this face is in the y-direction, since the face is perpendicular to the y-axis.But wait, the face ACC₁A₁ is actually a rectangle in the y=0 plane? Wait, no. Let me think again. Point A is at (0,0,0), C is at (a,0,0), C₁ is at (a,0,a), and A₁ is at (0,0,a). So, yes, all these points have y=0. So, the face ACC₁A₁ is indeed in the y=0 plane, which is the x-z plane.Therefore, the normal vector to this face is along the y-axis, either positive or negative y-direction. So, the normal vector is (0,1,0) or (0,-1,0).Now, to find the angle between the line AB₁ and the face ACC₁A₁, which is in the y=0 plane. The angle between a line and a plane is equal to the complement of the angle between the line and the normal to the plane.So, if θ is the angle between AB₁ and the normal, then the angle φ between AB₁ and the plane is 90° - θ.Alternatively, since the angle between the line and the plane is the smallest angle between the line and any line on the plane, which would be the same as 90° - θ.So, let's compute θ first, the angle between AB₁ and the normal vector.The vector AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a), so it's (0,a,a). The normal vector to the face is (0,1,0).The angle θ between AB₁ and the normal can be found using the dot product formula:cosθ = (AB₁ · n) / (|AB₁| |n|)Where AB₁ · n = (0)(0) + (a)(1) + (a)(0) = a|AB₁| = sqrt(0² + a² + a²) = sqrt(2a²) = a√2|n| = sqrt(0² + 1² + 0²) = 1So, cosθ = a / (a√2 * 1) = 1/√2Therefore, θ = 45°Thus, the angle φ between AB₁ and the plane is 90° - 45° = 45°Wait, but the problem asks for the sine of the angle. So, sinφ = sin(45°) = √2/2But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.Alternatively, maybe I should compute the angle between AB₁ and its projection onto the plane. Since the plane is y=0, projecting AB₁ onto the plane would set the y-component to zero.So, the projection of AB₁ onto the y=0 plane is from A(0,0,0) to (0,0,a), which is the vector (0,0,a). Wait, no, that's not right.Wait, AB₁ is from (0,0,0) to (0,a,a). Its projection onto the y=0 plane would be from (0,0,0) to (0,0,a), because we're setting the y-coordinate to zero. So, the projection vector is (0,0,a).Wait, but that seems incorrect because the projection should lie on the plane. The plane is y=0, so the projection of any point (x,y,z) is (x,0,z). So, the projection of B₁(0,a,a) is (0,0,a). So, the projection of AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to (0,0,a), which is vector (0,0,a).So, the length of AB₁ is sqrt(0 + a² + a²) = a√2The length of its projection is sqrt(0 + 0 + a²) = aTherefore, the angle φ between AB₁ and its projection is such that cosφ = (length of projection) / (length of AB₁) = a / (a√2) = 1/√2Therefore, φ = 45°, so sinφ = √2/2Wait, so both methods give the same result. So, the sine of the angle is √2/2.But wait, the problem states \\"the sine value of the angle formed by AB₁ and the side face ACC₁A₁.\\" So, is it 45°, whose sine is √2/2?But in the initial problem statement, the user provided a solution that resulted in √6/4. So, am I missing something here?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning coordinates. Let me double-check.Wait, in my coordinate system, the base ABC is a right triangle with legs AC and BC, each of length 'a', and AB as hypotenuse a√2. The side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are also length 'a'.But in the user's initial solution, they mentioned D₁ as the midpoint of A₁C₁, and then drawing B₁D₁ and AD₁. Then, they concluded that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁, making angle B₁AD₁ the angle in question.Wait, perhaps my coordinate system is different. Let me try to see.In my coordinate system, the face ACC₁A₁ is the y=0 plane, and the normal is along y-axis. But in the user's solution, they considered D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, which in my coordinates would be at (a/2,0,a). Then, B₁ is at (0,a,a). So, vector B₁D₁ would be from (0,a,a) to (a/2,0,a), which is (a/2, -a, 0). Hmm, is this vector perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁?Wait, the face ACC₁A₁ is in the y=0 plane, so its normal is along y-axis. For a vector to be perpendicular to the face, it should be parallel to the normal, i.e., along y-axis. But vector B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which is not along y-axis. So, perhaps my coordinate system is different.Wait, maybe I assigned the coordinates incorrectly. Let me try a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps the base triangle is not with legs AC and BC, but AB and AC? Wait, no, in a right triangular prism, the right angle is typically at the base. So, if ABC is the base, and it's a right triangle, the right angle is at C, so AC and BC are legs.Wait, maybe the user's solution is considering a different orientation. Let me try to see.In the user's solution, they mention D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, then draw B₁D₁ and AD₁. They say that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. So, in their coordinate system, perhaps the face ACC₁A₁ is not aligned with the y=0 plane, but is a different face.Wait, maybe I should assign the coordinates differently. Let me try to assign the base ABC with right angle at A instead of C. So, point A is at (0,0,0), point B at (a,0,0), point C at (0,a,0). Then, the top points would be A₁ at (0,0,a), B₁ at (a,0,a), C₁ at (0,a,a).In this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is the face connecting A(0,0,0), C(0,a,0), C₁(0,a,a), and A₁(0,0,a). So, this face is in the x=0 plane, with normal vector along x-axis.So, vector AB₁ goes from A(0,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a), which is vector (a,0,a). The face ACC₁A₁ is in the x=0 plane, with normal vector (1,0,0).So, the angle between AB₁ and the normal vector is θ, and the angle between AB₁ and the plane is 90° - θ.Compute cosθ: AB₁ · n / (|AB₁||n|) = (a)(1) + 0 + (a)(0) = a / (sqrt(a² + 0 + a²) * 1) = a / (a√2) = 1/√2Thus, θ = 45°, so angle with plane is 45°, sinφ = √2/2But again, this contradicts the user's solution of √6/4.Wait, perhaps the base triangle is not with legs 'a' and 'a', but one leg 'a' and the other something else. Wait, the problem says \\"side edge length is equal to the base edge length.\\" So, the side edges (AA₁, BB₁, CC₁) are equal to the base edges (AB, BC, CA). So, if the base is a right triangle, then the base edges are AB, BC, CA, with AB being the hypotenuse.So, if AB is the hypotenuse, then AB = sqrt(AC² + BC²). If the side edges are equal to the base edges, then AA₁ = AB. So, AA₁ = AB = sqrt(AC² + BC²). But if AC and BC are the legs, then AB is longer than AC or BC. So, unless AC = BC = a, then AB = a√2, and AA₁ = a√2.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \\"side edge length is equal to the base edge length.\\" So, perhaps all side edges are equal to all base edges. So, if the base edges are AC, BC, AB, then AA₁ = AB = AC = BC.But in a right triangle, AB is the hypotenuse, so AB > AC and AB > BC. Therefore, if AA₁ = AB, then AA₁ is longer than AC and BC. But the problem says \\"side edge length is equal to the base edge length,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that each side edge is equal to the corresponding base edge, or that all side edges are equal to all base edges.Wait, perhaps it means that each side edge is equal to the corresponding base edge. So, AA₁ = AB, BB₁ = BC, CC₁ = CA. But in a right triangle, AB is the hypotenuse, so AA₁ would be longer than AC or BC.Alternatively, perhaps all side edges are equal to the base edges, meaning AA₁ = AB = BC = CA. But in a right triangle, AB is longer than AC and BC, so this would require AB = AC = BC, which would make the triangle equilateral, but it's a right triangle, so that's impossible.Therefore, perhaps the base edges are all equal, making the base an equilateral triangle, but it's a right triangle, so that's not possible either.Wait, maybe the base is a right triangle with legs equal to the side edges. So, if the side edges are length 'a', then the legs AC and BC are also length 'a', making AB = a√2. Then, the side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are also length 'a'.So, in this case, the base triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs AC = BC = a, hypotenuse AB = a√2, and side edges AA₁ = BB₁ = CC₁ = a.So, in this case, the prism has base edges AC = BC = a, AB = a√2, and side edges AA₁ = BB₁ = CC₁ = a.So, in this case, let's assign coordinates accordingly.Let me place point A at (0,0,0), point C at (a,0,0), point B at (0,a,0). Then, the top points would be A₁ at (0,0,a), B₁ at (0,a,a), C₁ at (a,0,a).So, vector AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a), which is (0,a,a). The face ACC₁A₁ is the rectangle connecting A(0,0,0), C(a,0,0), C₁(a,0,a), and A₁(0,0,a). So, this face is in the y=0 plane.So, the normal vector to this face is along the y-axis, (0,1,0).So, the angle between AB₁ and the normal is θ, with cosθ = (AB₁ · n)/(|AB₁||n|) = (0*0 + a*1 + a*0)/(sqrt(0 + a² + a²)*1) = a/(a√2) = 1/√2, so θ = 45°, and the angle between AB₁ and the plane is 45°, so sinφ = √2/2.But again, this contradicts the user's solution of √6/4.Wait, perhaps the user considered a different face. Wait, the user mentioned side face ACC₁A₁, which in my coordinate system is the y=0 plane. But in their solution, they considered D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, and then drew B₁D₁ and AD₁, and concluded that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁.Wait, in my coordinate system, A₁C₁ is from (0,0,a) to (a,0,a), so midpoint D₁ is at (a/2,0,a). Then, B₁ is at (0,a,a). So, vector B₁D₁ is from (0,a,a) to (a/2,0,a), which is (a/2, -a, 0).Is this vector perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁? The face is in the y=0 plane, so its normal is along y-axis. For a vector to be perpendicular to the face, it must be parallel to the normal, i.e., along y-axis. But vector B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which is not along y-axis. Therefore, it's not perpendicular.Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their solution. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Wait, let me try to approach it differently. Maybe instead of using coordinates, I can use geometric reasoning.Given a right triangular prism with base ABC, right angle at C, and side edges equal to base edges. So, AC = BC = AA₁ = a, and AB = a√2.We need to find the sine of the angle between AB₁ and the face ACC₁A₁.The angle between a line and a plane is the angle between the line and its projection onto the plane. So, let's find the projection of AB₁ onto the face ACC₁A₁.Point A is on the face, so projection of A is itself. The projection of B₁ onto the face ACC₁A₁ would be the point on the face closest to B₁. Since the face is ACC₁A₁, which is a rectangle, the projection of B₁ would be the point where a perpendicular from B₁ meets the face.Wait, but how do we find that? Alternatively, since the face is a rectangle, we can find the projection by dropping a perpendicular from B₁ to the face.But in this case, the face is in the y=0 plane, so the projection of B₁(0,a,a) onto the y=0 plane is (0,0,a). So, the projection of AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to (0,0,a).Wait, but that's the same as before. So, the projection is vector (0,0,a), length a, while AB₁ has length a√2. So, the angle φ between AB₁ and its projection is such that cosφ = a/(a√2) = 1/√2, so φ = 45°, sinφ = √2/2.But again, this contradicts the user's solution.Wait, perhaps the user considered a different angle. They mentioned angle B₁AD₁, where D₁ is midpoint of A₁C₁. So, in my coordinate system, D₁ is (a/2,0,a). So, point A is (0,0,0), D₁ is (a/2,0,a), and B₁ is (0,a,a).So, triangle B₁AD₁ has points B₁(0,a,a), A(0,0,0), D₁(a/2,0,a).So, vector AB₁ is (0,a,a), vector AD₁ is (a/2,0,a).Wait, the user says that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. But in my coordinates, vector B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which is not perpendicular to the face, as discussed earlier.Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their solution. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.Wait, let me try to compute the angle using vectors.Vector AB₁ is (0,a,a). The face ACC₁A₁ has normal vector (0,1,0). The angle between AB₁ and the normal is θ, with cosθ = (AB₁ · n)/(|AB₁||n|) = a/(a√2 *1) = 1/√2, so θ = 45°, so angle with plane is 45°, sinφ = √2/2.Alternatively, if I consider the angle between AB₁ and the face as the angle between AB₁ and its projection onto the face, which is vector (0,0,a). So, the angle between (0,a,a) and (0,0,a).The dot product is (0)(0) + (a)(0) + (a)(a) = a²|AB₁| = a√2, |projection| = aSo, cosφ = a²/(a√2 * a) = 1/√2, so φ = 45°, sinφ = √2/2.So, both methods give the same result.But the user's solution got √6/4. So, perhaps the user considered a different configuration.Wait, maybe the base triangle is not with legs AC and BC, but AB and AC, making AB a leg instead of the hypotenuse. Let me try that.So, suppose the base triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A, so AB and AC are legs, each of length 'a', and BC is the hypotenuse of length a√2. Then, the side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are also length 'a'.So, in this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is the rectangle connecting A(0,0,0), C(a,0,0), C₁(a,0,a), and A₁(0,0,a). So, the normal vector is along y-axis.Vector AB₁ goes from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a), which is (0,a,a).So, same as before, the angle between AB₁ and the normal is 45°, so angle with plane is 45°, sinφ = √2/2.Wait, same result.Alternatively, maybe the base triangle is not right-angled at C or A, but at B. Let me try that.So, base triangle ABC with right angle at B. So, AB and BC are legs, each of length 'a', and AC is hypotenuse of length a√2. Then, side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are length 'a'.So, coordinates:A: (0,0,0)B: (a,0,0)C: (a,a,0)A₁: (0,0,a)B₁: (a,0,a)C₁: (a,a,a)So, vector AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a), which is (a,0,a).The face ACC₁A₁ is the rectangle connecting A(0,0,0), C(a,a,0), C₁(a,a,a), and A₁(0,0,a). Wait, no, ACC₁A₁ would be connecting A(0,0,0), C(a,a,0), C₁(a,a,a), and A₁(0,0,a). So, this face is not aligned with any axis, making it more complex.So, to find the normal vector to this face, we can take two vectors on the face and compute their cross product.Vectors AC and AA₁:AC = C - A = (a,a,0)AA₁ = A₁ - A = (0,0,a)So, cross product AC × AA₁ = |i  j  k|                              |a  a  0|                              |0  0  a|= i(a*a - 0*0) - j(a*a - 0*0) + k(a*0 - a*0)= i(a²) - j(a²) + k(0)= (a², -a², 0)So, normal vector is (a², -a², 0), which can be simplified to (1, -1, 0) direction.So, the normal vector is (1, -1, 0). Let's normalize it, but for the dot product, we can use it as is.Vector AB₁ is (a,0,a). The normal vector is (1, -1, 0).Compute the angle θ between AB₁ and the normal:cosθ = (AB₁ · n)/(|AB₁||n|)AB₁ · n = a*1 + 0*(-1) + a*0 = a|AB₁| = sqrt(a² + 0 + a²) = a√2|n| = sqrt(1 + 1 + 0) = √2So, cosθ = a / (a√2 * √2) = a / (a*2) = 1/2Thus, θ = 60°, so the angle between AB₁ and the plane is 90° - 60° = 30°, so sinφ = sin(30°) = 1/2Wait, that's different. So, in this configuration, the sine of the angle is 1/2.But this contradicts the previous results. So, which configuration is correct?Wait, the problem says \\"right triangular prism ABC-A₁B₁C₁ whose side edge length is equal to the base edge length.\\" So, the base edges are AB, BC, CA, and the side edges are AA₁, BB₁, CC₁.If the base is a right triangle with right angle at B, then AB and BC are legs, each of length 'a', and AC is hypotenuse a√2. Then, side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are also length 'a'.So, in this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is not aligned with any axis, and the normal vector is (1, -1, 0). So, the angle between AB₁ and the plane is 30°, sinφ = 1/2.But this is different from the previous results. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't specify where the right angle is, so it's ambiguous. But in the user's solution, they considered the right angle at C, leading to a different result.Wait, let me check the user's solution again.They said: Let D₁ be the midpoint of A₁C₁, and draw line segments B₁D₁ and AD₁. In the right triangular prism ABC-A₁B₁C₁, B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. Thus, angle B₁AD₁ is the angle formed by AB₁ and the side face ACC₁A₁.Then, they computed sin(angle B₁AD₁) = (B₁D₁)/AB₁ = (√3/2 AB)/(√2 AB) = √6/4.Wait, so in their solution, they have B₁D₁ = (√3/2)AB, and AB₁ = √2 AB.But in my coordinate system where the right angle is at C, B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which has length sqrt((a/2)^2 + a² + 0) = sqrt(a²/4 + a²) = sqrt(5a²/4) = (a√5)/2, which is not √3/2 AB.Wait, so perhaps their coordinate system is different.Alternatively, maybe the base triangle is equilateral? But it's a right triangle, so that's not possible.Wait, perhaps the base triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 'a' and hypotenuse of length 'a√2', and the side edges are also length 'a'. So, in this case, the prism has base edges AC = BC = a, AB = a√2, and side edges AA₁ = BB₁ = CC₁ = a.So, in this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is a rectangle with sides AC = a and AA₁ = a, so it's a square? Wait, no, because AC is a base edge, and AA₁ is a side edge, both length 'a', so the face ACC₁A₁ is a square.Wait, but in reality, the face ACC₁A₁ is a rectangle, not necessarily a square, unless AC = AA₁, which they are both 'a', so yes, it's a square.So, in this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is a square, and D₁ is the midpoint of A₁C₁, so D₁ is at (a/2,0,a).Then, vector B₁D₁ is from B₁(0,a,a) to D₁(a/2,0,a), which is (a/2, -a, 0).The user claims that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. But in this coordinate system, the face ACC₁A₁ is a square in the y=0 plane, so its normal vector is along y-axis. For B₁D₁ to be perpendicular to the face, it must be parallel to the normal vector, i.e., along y-axis. But vector B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which is not along y-axis. Therefore, their claim seems incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their solution.Wait, but if B₁D₁ is not perpendicular to the face, then angle B₁AD₁ is not the angle between AB₁ and the face. Therefore, their approach might be flawed.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered a different face. Wait, the face ACC₁A₁ is a square, so its diagonal is A₁C₁, and D₁ is the midpoint. So, perhaps B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face in some other way.Wait, let me compute the dot product of B₁D₁ and the normal vector of the face. The normal vector is (0,1,0). So, B₁D₁ · n = (a/2)(0) + (-a)(1) + (0)(0) = -a ≠ 0. Therefore, B₁D₁ is not perpendicular to the face.So, the user's solution seems incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the face ACC₁A₁ as a different face. Wait, in their solution, they mentioned drawing B₁D₁ and AD₁, and then angle B₁AD₁. So, point D₁ is midpoint of A₁C₁, so in my coordinate system, D₁ is (a/2,0,a). Then, AD₁ is from A(0,0,0) to D₁(a/2,0,a), which is vector (a/2,0,a). Similarly, B₁D₁ is from B₁(0,a,a) to D₁(a/2,0,a), which is vector (a/2, -a, 0).So, in triangle B₁AD₁, we have points B₁(0,a,a), A(0,0,0), D₁(a/2,0,a).So, vector AB₁ is (0,a,a), vector AD₁ is (a/2,0,a).Wait, the user says that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁, but as we saw, it's not. Therefore, their conclusion that angle B₁AD₁ is the angle between AB₁ and the face is incorrect.Therefore, their solution is flawed, and the correct answer should be √2/2.But wait, in the initial problem, the user's solution got √6/4, which is approximately 0.612, while √2/2 is approximately 0.707. So, which one is correct?Wait, let me try to compute the angle using another method.The angle between AB₁ and the face ACC₁A₁ can be found by considering the projection of AB₁ onto the face.So, vector AB₁ is (0,a,a). The face ACC₁A₁ is in the y=0 plane, so to project AB₁ onto this face, we set the y-component to zero, resulting in vector (0,0,a).So, the projection is (0,0,a), length a.The original vector AB₁ has length a√2.So, the angle φ between AB₁ and its projection is such that cosφ = a/(a√2) = 1/√2, so φ = 45°, sinφ = √2/2.Alternatively, the angle between AB₁ and the face is 45°, so sinφ = √2/2.Therefore, the correct answer should be √2/2.But the user's solution got √6/4, which is different. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in their approach.Alternatively, maybe the problem was intended to have the base triangle with legs of length 'a' and side edges of length 'a', but the face ACC₁A₁ is not the y=0 plane, but a different face.Wait, in the user's solution, they considered D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, and then drew B₁D₁ and AD₁, claiming that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. But as we saw, in my coordinate system, this is not the case.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered a different coordinate system where the face ACC₁A₁ is not aligned with any axis, making B₁D₁ perpendicular to it.Wait, let me try to compute the normal vector to the face ACC₁A₁ in the user's coordinate system.If the face ACC₁A₁ is a rectangle, then vectors AC and AA₁ lie on the face. So, vector AC = C - A, and vector AA₁ = A₁ - A.In the user's solution, they have D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, so A₁C₁ is a diagonal of the face ACC₁A₁.Wait, perhaps in their coordinate system, the face ACC₁A₁ is not aligned with any axis, making the normal vector different.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the face ACC₁A₁ as a different face, not the one I'm considering.Wait, perhaps the face ACC₁A₁ is not the one with right angle at C, but at A. So, in that case, the face would be a different rectangle.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.Let me consider the general case.Given a right triangular prism with base ABC, right angle at C, and side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ equal to the base edges.So, AC = BC = AA₁ = a, AB = a√2.We need to find the sine of the angle between AB₁ and the face ACC₁A₁.The face ACC₁A₁ is a rectangle with sides AC = a and AA₁ = a, so it's a square.To find the angle between AB₁ and this face, we can use the formula:sinφ = |(AB₁ · n)| / |AB₁|Where n is the unit normal vector to the face.The normal vector to the face can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors on the face.Vectors AC and AA₁:AC = (a,0,0)AA₁ = (0,0,a)Cross product AC × AA₁ = (0, a², 0) - (a², 0, 0) = (0, a², 0) - (a², 0, 0) = (-a², a², 0)Wait, no, cross product is:|i  j  k||a  0  0||0  0  a|= i(0*a - 0*0) - j(a*a - 0*0) + k(a*0 - 0*0)= i(0) - j(a²) + k(0)= (0, -a², 0)So, normal vector is (0, -a², 0), which is along negative y-axis.So, unit normal vector is (0, -1, 0).Vector AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a), which is (0,a,a).So, AB₁ · n = (0)(0) + (a)(-1) + (a)(0) = -a|AB₁| = sqrt(0 + a² + a²) = a√2So, sinφ = |AB₁ · n| / |AB₁| = | -a | / (a√2) = a / (a√2) = 1/√2Therefore, sinφ = √2/2So, the sine of the angle is √2/2.Therefore, the user's solution of √6/4 is incorrect.But wait, in the user's solution, they considered D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, and then computed B₁D₁ as (√3/2)AB, but in my coordinate system, B₁D₁ is (a/2, -a, 0), which has length sqrt((a/2)^2 + a²) = sqrt(a²/4 + a²) = sqrt(5a²/4) = (a√5)/2, which is not √3/2 AB.Therefore, their approach is flawed.So, the correct answer should be √2/2.But wait, in the initial problem, the user's solution got √6/4, which is approximately 0.612, while √2/2 is approximately 0.707.Wait, perhaps the user considered the angle between AB₁ and the face as the angle between AB₁ and the normal, which is 45°, and then took sine of that, which is √2/2. But in their solution, they took the ratio of B₁D₁ to AB₁, which is (√3/2 AB)/(√2 AB) = √6/4.But in my coordinate system, B₁D₁ is not perpendicular to the face, so their approach is incorrect.Therefore, the correct answer is √2/2.But wait, let me double-check.Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the angle between AB₁ and the face as the angle between AB₁ and the line of greatest slope on the face, which would be different.Wait, the angle between a line and a plane is defined as the angle between the line and its projection onto the plane, which is the smallest angle between the line and any line on the plane.So, in this case, the projection of AB₁ onto the face ACC₁A₁ is from A(0,0,0) to (0,0,a), which is vector (0,0,a). So, the angle between AB₁ and its projection is 45°, as we saw.Therefore, sinφ = √2/2.So, the correct answer is √2/2.But the user's solution got √6/4, which is incorrect.Therefore, the final answer should be √2/2.But wait, let me check again.Wait, in the user's solution, they considered D₁ as midpoint of A₁C₁, and then drew B₁D₁ and AD₁, claiming that B₁D₁ is perpendicular to the face ACC₁A₁. Then, they computed sin(angle B₁AD₁) = B₁D₁ / AB₁ = (√3/2 AB) / (√2 AB) = √6/4.But in my coordinate system, B₁D₁ is not perpendicular to the face, so their approach is wrong.Therefore, the correct answer is √2/2.But wait, in the initial problem, the user's solution got √6/4, which is approximately 0.612, while √2/2 is approximately 0.707.Wait, perhaps the user considered a different configuration where the base triangle is not right-angled at C, but at A, making the face ACC₁A₁ a different face.Wait, if the base triangle is right-angled at A, then AC and AB are legs, each of length 'a', and BC is hypotenuse a√2. Then, the side edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are also length 'a'.So, in this case, the face ACC₁A₁ is a rectangle connecting A(0,0,0), C(a,0,0), C₁(a,0,a), and A₁(0,0,a). So, the normal vector is along y-axis.Vector AB₁ is from A(0,0,0) to B₁(0,a,a), which is (0,a,a).So, same as before, the angle between AB₁ and the normal is 45°, so angle with plane is 45°, sinφ = √2/2.Therefore, regardless of where the right angle is, the result is the same.Therefore, the correct answer is √2/2.But the user's solution got √6/4, which is incorrect.Therefore, the final answer is √2/2."},{"question":"Calculate 0.5 cdot 0.3.","answer":"To calculate the product of 0.5 and 0.3, I first express each decimal as a fraction of 10. 0.5 is equivalent to 5 multiplied by 10 to the power of -1, and 0.3 is equivalent to 3 multiplied by 10 to the power of -1.Next, I multiply these two expressions together.

Note: If multiple conditions are chosen for answering separately, the first answer will be scored.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about two sets, P and Q, defined by quadratic inequalities. It's divided into two parts, and I need to solve both. Let me take it step by step.Starting with part (1): They give me sets P and Q, and when a=1, I need to find the complement of P intersected with Q. Okay, let's break this down.First, let's figure out what set P is. The inequality defining P is 2x² - 3x + 1 ≤ 0. Hmm, quadratic inequalities can be tricky, but I remember that to solve them, I should factor the quadratic if possible.Let me try factoring 2x² - 3x + 1. I need two numbers that multiply to 2*1=2 and add up to -3. Hmm, -1 and -2? Let me check: (2x - 1)(x - 1) = 2x² - 2x - x + 1 = 2x² - 3x + 1. Perfect, that factors correctly.So, the inequality becomes (2x - 1)(x - 1) ≤ 0. To find the solution set, I'll determine the critical points where each factor is zero: x = 1/2 and x = 1.Now, I'll test the intervals determined by these critical points: (-∞, 1/2), (1/2, 1), and (1, ∞). - For x < 1/2, say x=0: (2*0 -1)(0 -1) = (-1)(-1) = 1 > 0.- For 1/2 < x < 1, say x=3/4: (2*(3/4) -1)(3/4 -1) = (1.5 -1)(-0.25) = (0.5)(-0.25) = -0.125 < 0.- For x > 1, say x=2: (4 -1)(2 -1) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0.Since the inequality is ≤ 0, the solution includes the intervals where the product is negative or zero. So, P is [1/2, 1].Next, set Q is defined by (x - a)(x - a - 1) ≤ 0. When a=1, this becomes (x - 1)(x - 2) ≤ 0. Let's solve this.Again, find the critical points: x=1 and x=2. Test the intervals:- For x < 1, say x=0: (0 -1)(0 -2) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0.- For 1 < x < 2, say x=1.5: (1.5 -1)(1.5 -2) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0.- For x > 2, say x=3: (3 -1)(3 -2) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0.Since the inequality is ≤ 0, the solution is [1, 2]. So, Q is [1, 2].Now, I need to find the complement of P intersected with Q. The complement of P, denoted as ∁U P, is all real numbers not in P. Since P is [1/2, 1], the complement is (-∞, 1/2) ∪ (1, ∞).So, ∁U P is (-∞, 1/2) ∪ (1, ∞). Now, intersecting this with Q, which is [1, 2], we look for the overlap between (-∞, 1/2) ∪ (1, ∞) and [1, 2].The overlap is (1, ∞) intersected with [1, 2], which is (1, 2]. So, the intersection is (1, 2].Alright, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to part (2). It says \\"If _____ (please choose from ① P∩Q=P, ② x∈P is a sufficient condition for x∈Q, ③ P∪Q=Q), find the range of real number a.\\"Hmm, the note says if multiple conditions are chosen, the first answer will be scored. So, I think I need to choose one of these conditions and solve for a. Let me see what each condition implies.Condition ①: P∩Q=P. That means every element of P is also in Q, so P is a subset of Q. That makes sense because if the intersection is P, then P must be entirely within Q.Condition ②: x∈P is a sufficient condition for x∈Q. In logical terms, this means if x is in P, then x is in Q. Which is the same as P being a subset of Q. So, this is equivalent to condition ①.Condition ③: P∪Q=Q. This means that adding P to Q doesn't change Q, which implies that P is a subset of Q. So, again, same as conditions ① and ②.Wait, so all three conditions are equivalent? They all imply that P is a subset of Q. So, regardless of which one I choose, I need to find the range of a such that P is a subset of Q.Alright, so let's proceed with that understanding. I'll choose condition ① for simplicity.So, I need to find all real numbers a such that P is a subset of Q.Given that P is [1/2, 1], and Q is [a, a+1], since Q is defined by (x - a)(x - a -1) ≤ 0, which we've already solved as [a, a+1].So, for P to be a subset of Q, the entire interval [1/2, 1] must lie within [a, a+1].This means that the lower bound of Q must be less than or equal to the lower bound of P, and the upper bound of Q must be greater than or equal to the upper bound of P.In mathematical terms:a ≤ 1/2 and a + 1 ≥ 1.Let's solve these inequalities.First inequality: a ≤ 1/2.Second inequality: a + 1 ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≥ 0.So, combining both inequalities, we have 0 ≤ a ≤ 1/2.Therefore, the range of a is [0, 1/2].Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.If a=0, then Q is [0,1]. P is [1/2,1]. So, P is entirely within Q. Good.If a=1/2, then Q is [1/2, 3/2]. P is [1/2,1], which is entirely within Q. Good.If a is between 0 and 1/2, say a=1/4, then Q is [1/4, 5/4]. P is [1/2,1], which is within [1/4,5/4]. Perfect.If a is less than 0, say a=-1, then Q is [-1,0]. P is [1/2,1], which doesn't overlap with Q. So, P is not a subset of Q. Hence, a must be at least 0.Similarly, if a is greater than 1/2, say a=3/4, then Q is [3/4, 7/4]. P is [1/2,1]. Since 1/2 < 3/4, the lower bound of P is less than the lower bound of Q, so P is not entirely within Q. Hence, a must be at most 1/2.So, my conclusion is that a must be between 0 and 1/2, inclusive.Therefore, the range of a is [0, 1/2].**Final Answer**(1) boxed{{x mid 1 < x leqslant 2}}(2) boxed{[0, frac{1}{2}]}"},{"question":"The test has 5 sections, each containing the same number of questions.

Let me try to tackle each part step by step.Starting with part (1): Find the equation of the tangent line to g(x) at x = -1.Hmm, g(x) is defined as (1/2)x|x|. I remember that |x| is equal to x when x is positive and -x when x is negative. So, for x = -1, which is negative, |x| would be -x. Therefore, g(x) when x is negative becomes (1/2)x*(-x) = - (1/2)x². So, g(-1) would be - (1/2)*(-1)² = - (1/2)*1 = -1/2.Now, to find the tangent line, I need the derivative of g(x) at x = -1. Since for x < 0, g(x) = - (1/2)x², the derivative g’(x) would be the derivative of - (1/2)x², which is -x. So, g’(-1) = -(-1) = 1.So, the slope of the tangent line at x = -1 is 1, and the point is (-1, -1/2). Using the point-slope form of a line, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), plugging in the values: y - (-1/2) = 1*(x - (-1)), which simplifies to y + 1/2 = x + 1. Subtracting 1/2 from both sides gives y = x + 1 - 1/2, which is y = x + 1/2. Wait, but the original point was (-1, -1/2). Let me check if that's correct.Wait, if I plug x = -1 into y = x + 1/2, I get y = -1 + 1/2 = -1/2, which matches the point. So, the equation of the tangent line is y = x + 1/2. Alternatively, I can write it as x - y = 1/2 by rearranging terms. So, that should be the equation.Moving on to part (2): Let F(x) = x f(x) - g(x). Determine the intervals of monotonicity for F(x).First, let's write out F(x). Since f(x) = ln x and g(x) = (1/2)x|x|, we have F(x) = x ln x - (1/2)x|x|. Now, since x is in the domain of ln x, which is x > 0, we can consider x > 0. For x > 0, |x| = x, so g(x) = (1/2)x². Therefore, F(x) = x ln x - (1/2)x².To find the intervals of monotonicity, I need to find the derivative F’(x) and determine where it's positive or negative.Calculating F’(x): The derivative of x ln x is ln x + 1 (using the product rule: derivative of x is 1 times ln x plus x times derivative of ln x, which is 1/x). The derivative of (1/2)x² is x. So, F’(x) = (ln x + 1) - x.So, F’(x) = ln x + 1 - x.To find where F’(x) is positive or negative, we can analyze this function. Let's consider F’(x) = ln x + 1 - x.I can analyze this function by looking at its derivative, which is F''(x). The second derivative will tell me about the concavity and can help in understanding the behavior of F’(x).Calculating F''(x): The derivative of ln x is 1/x, and the derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of -x is -1. So, F''(x) = 1/x - 1.Now, let's find where F''(x) is positive or negative. F''(x) = 1/x - 1.Setting F''(x) = 0: 1/x - 1 = 0 => 1/x = 1 => x = 1.So, at x = 1, F''(x) = 0. For x < 1, say x = 0.5, F''(0.5) = 1/0.5 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 > 0. For x > 1, say x = 2, F''(2) = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2 < 0.Therefore, F''(x) is positive for x < 1 and negative for x > 1. This means that F’(x) is increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, ∞).Since F’(x) is increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, ∞), and since F’(1) = ln 1 + 1 - 1 = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0.So, at x = 1, F’(x) = 0. Let's check the behavior around x = 1.For x approaching 0 from the right, ln x approaches -∞, so F’(x) = ln x + 1 - x approaches -∞. At x = 1, F’(x) = 0. For x > 1, since F’(x) is decreasing and F’(1) = 0, F’(x) becomes negative as x increases beyond 1.Therefore, F’(x) is positive on (0,1) and negative on (1, ∞). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion because if F’(x) is increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, ∞), and F’(1) = 0, then F’(x) must be increasing from -∞ up to 0 at x = 1, and then decreasing from 0 to negative values beyond x = 1.Wait, that would mean F’(x) is negative for all x except at x = 1 where it's zero. But that can't be because when x approaches 0 from the right, F’(x) approaches -∞, and at x = 1, it's 0, so it must be increasing from -∞ to 0 on (0,1). Then, for x > 1, it's decreasing from 0 to negative infinity. So, F’(x) is positive only at x = 1, but actually, no, because at x = 1, it's zero. So, F’(x) is negative on (0,1) and continues to be negative on (1, ∞). Wait, that can't be because if F’(x) is increasing on (0,1), starting from -∞ and reaching 0 at x = 1, then it's negative on (0,1) and zero at x = 1. Then, for x > 1, since F’(x) is decreasing from 0, it becomes negative. So, overall, F’(x) is negative on (0, ∞), except at x = 1 where it's zero.Wait, that would mean F(x) is decreasing on (0, ∞). But let me check at x = 2, F’(2) = ln 2 + 1 - 2 ≈ 0.693 + 1 - 2 ≈ -0.307 < 0. At x = 0.5, F’(0.5) = ln 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 ≈ -0.693 + 1 - 0.5 ≈ -0.193 < 0. So, indeed, F’(x) is negative everywhere except at x = 1 where it's zero. Therefore, F(x) is decreasing on (0, ∞).Wait, but I thought F’(x) was increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, ∞). So, if F’(x) is increasing on (0,1), starting from -∞ and reaching 0 at x = 1, and then decreasing from 0 to negative values beyond x = 1, that means F’(x) is negative on (0,1) and becomes more negative beyond x = 1. So, overall, F’(x) is negative on (0, ∞), meaning F(x) is decreasing on (0, ∞).Therefore, the function F(x) is monotonically decreasing on its entire domain, which is x > 0.Now, part (3): If for all x1, x2 ∈ [1, ∞) with x1 > x2, it always holds that m[g(x1) - g(x2)] > x1 f(x1) - x2 f(x2), find the range of values for the real number m.So, we have m[g(x1) - g(x2)] > x1 f(x1) - x2 f(x2) for all x1 > x2 ≥ 1.Let me rewrite this inequality: m[g(x1) - g(x2)] > x1 f(x1) - x2 f(x2).Dividing both sides by (x1 - x2) (since x1 > x2, x1 - x2 > 0), we get:m * [g(x1) - g(x2)] / (x1 - x2) > [x1 f(x1) - x2 f(x2)] / (x1 - x2).As x1 approaches x2, the left side becomes m * g’(x) and the right side becomes the derivative of x f(x). So, in the limit as x1 approaches x2, we have:m * g’(x) ≥ (x f(x))’.But since the inequality must hold for all x1 > x2 ≥ 1, it must hold in the limit as well, so we can consider the derivative condition.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the function h(x) = m g(x) - x f(x). Then, the given inequality can be written as h(x1) - h(x2) > 0 for x1 > x2 ≥ 1. This implies that h(x) is increasing on [1, ∞).Therefore, h’(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1.Let me compute h’(x). h(x) = m g(x) - x f(x). So, h’(x) = m g’(x) - [f(x) + x f’(x)].Given that f(x) = ln x, f’(x) = 1/x. And g(x) = (1/2)x|x|. For x ≥ 1, |x| = x, so g(x) = (1/2)x², and g’(x) = x.Therefore, h’(x) = m * x - [ln x + x * (1/x)] = m x - (ln x + 1).So, h’(x) = m x - ln x - 1.We need h’(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1.Therefore, m x - ln x - 1 ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1.We can rearrange this as m ≥ (ln x + 1)/x for all x ≥ 1.So, m must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of (ln x + 1)/x on [1, ∞).Let me define k(x) = (ln x + 1)/x. We need to find the maximum of k(x) on [1, ∞).To find the maximum, let's compute the derivative of k(x):k’(x) = [ (1/x) * x - (ln x + 1) * 1 ] / x² = [1 - ln x - 1]/x² = (- ln x)/x².So, k’(x) = - (ln x)/x².Now, let's analyze the sign of k’(x):- For x > 1, ln x > 0, so k’(x) = - (positive)/x² < 0.- At x = 1, ln 1 = 0, so k’(1) = 0.Therefore, k(x) is decreasing on [1, ∞) because its derivative is negative for x > 1.Since k(x) is decreasing on [1, ∞), its maximum occurs at x = 1.Calculating k(1) = (ln 1 + 1)/1 = (0 + 1)/1 = 1.Therefore, the maximum value of k(x) on [1, ∞) is 1, and since k(x) is decreasing, for all x ≥ 1, k(x) ≤ 1.Thus, to satisfy m ≥ k(x) for all x ≥ 1, m must be at least 1.Therefore, the range of m is m ≥ 1.Let me double-check this reasoning.We have h’(x) = m x - ln x - 1 ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1.We need m ≥ (ln x + 1)/x for all x ≥ 1.Since (ln x + 1)/x is maximized at x = 1 with value 1, and it decreases thereafter, m must be at least 1 to satisfy the inequality for all x ≥ 1.Yes, that makes sense.So, summarizing:1. The tangent line at x = -1 is y = x + 1/2, or x - y = 1/2.2. F(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, ∞).3. The range of m is m ≥ 1.I think that's it."},{"question":"John took a test with 80 questions.  For the first 40 questions, she got 90% right.  For the next 40 questions, she gets 95% right.

How many miles does he walk after walking for 2 hours? Express your answer as a decimal.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Henry walks at a constant rate of 4 miles per hour. How many miles does he walk after walking for 2 hours? And I need to express the answer as a decimal. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that when dealing with constant rates, especially rates of speed, the basic formula that comes to mind is distance equals rate multiplied by time. So, in mathematical terms, that's:[ text{Distance} = text{Rate} times text{Time} ]In this problem, the rate is given as 4 miles per hour. That means Henry walks 4 miles every hour. The time he spends walking is 2 hours. So, plugging these values into the formula should give me the distance he covers.Let me write that out:[ text{Distance} = 4 , text{miles/hour} times 2 , text{hours} ]Now, when I multiply these two, the units are important. The \\"hours\\" unit in the denominator and the \\"hours\\" unit in the numerator will cancel each other out, leaving me with just miles, which is what I want for the distance.So, calculating that:[ 4 times 2 = 8 ]Therefore, the distance Henry walks is 8 miles. Since the problem asks for the answer as a decimal, I need to make sure that 8 is expressed in decimal form. But 8 is already a whole number, so in decimal form, it's just 8.0.Wait, let me double-check that. If I convert 8 into a decimal, it's indeed 8.0. There's no fractional part here, so it's straightforward.Is there anything else I need to consider? Hmm, the problem mentions that Henry walks at a constant rate. That means his speed doesn't change during the 2 hours. So, I don't need to worry about any acceleration or deceleration; it's a steady pace.Also, the units are consistent. The rate is in miles per hour, and the time is in hours, so multiplying them directly gives me the distance in miles without any need for conversion.Let me visualize this. If Henry walks 4 miles in one hour, then in two hours, he would cover twice that distance. So, 4 miles plus another 4 miles equals 8 miles. That makes sense.Another way to think about it is by using the concept of speed. Speed is essentially the rate at which someone or something moves. Here, Henry's speed is 4 miles per hour, meaning every hour, he covers 4 miles. So, over the span of 2 hours, it's just 4 multiplied by 2.I could also break it down into smaller intervals to verify. For example, in the first hour, he walks 4 miles. In the second hour, he walks another 4 miles. Adding those together gives 8 miles. This step-by-step approach confirms the initial calculation.Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? Maybe if the rate wasn't constant, but the problem explicitly states that it is. So, I don't need to adjust for any changes in speed.Also, considering the time frame is exactly 2 hours, there's no partial hour or fraction to deal with, which simplifies the calculation.In summary, using the basic formula for distance, ensuring the units are consistent, and verifying through multiple methods like interval breakdown all lead me to the same conclusion: Henry walks 8 miles in 2 hours at a constant rate of 4 miles per hour.Just to be thorough, I'll write out the calculation again:[ text{Distance} = 4 , text{mph} times 2 , text{hours} = 8 , text{miles} ]Expressed as a decimal, it's 8.0 miles. However, since 8 is a whole number, it's common to just write it as 8 miles. But since the problem specifies a decimal, I'll include the .0 to make it clear it's in decimal form.So, after carefully considering all aspects of the problem and verifying my calculations through different methods, I'm confident that the answer is 8.0 miles."},{"question":"Marcia's hair is 24\\" long at the beginning of the school year.

I need to find two things: first, the value of 1/sin α + 1/cos α, and second, the value of tan α. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.Starting with part (I): I need to find 1/sin α + 1/cos α. I remember that 1/sin α is csc α and 1/cos α is sec α, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can combine these two fractions. Let's see:1/sin α + 1/cos α = (cos α + sin α) / (sin α cos α). Oh, that's right! So it's the sum of sin and cos over the product of sin and cos. Wait, I already know that sin α + cos α is 1/5, so that part is given. But I don't know sin α cos α yet. Maybe I can find that.I recall that (sin α + cos α)^2 equals sin² α + 2 sin α cos α + cos² α. Since sin² α + cos² α is 1, that means (1/5)^2 = 1 + 2 sin α cos α. Let me write that down:(1/5)^2 = 1 + 2 sin α cos α  1/25 = 1 + 2 sin α cos α  So, 2 sin α cos α = 1/25 - 1  2 sin α cos α = 1/25 - 25/25  2 sin α cos α = -24/25  Therefore, sin α cos α = -12/25.Okay, so now I can plug that back into the expression for 1/sin α + 1/cos α:(cos α + sin α) / (sin α cos α) = (1/5) / (-12/25)  Let me compute that: (1/5) divided by (-12/25) is the same as (1/5) * (-25/12)  Which is (-25/60) simplifying to (-5/12).So, for part (I), the value is -5/12. That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to part (II): finding tan α. I know that tan α is sin α / cos α. I have sin α + cos α = 1/5, and I found sin α cos α = -12/25. Maybe I can find sin α and cos α individually.Let me denote sin α = s and cos α = c for simplicity. So, I have:s + c = 1/5  s * c = -12/25I also know that s² + c² = 1. Maybe I can use these equations to solve for s and c.From the first equation, s + c = 1/5. If I square both sides, I get:(s + c)^2 = s² + 2sc + c² = (1/5)^2  Which is 1 + 2sc = 1/25  Wait, that's the same as before. So, 2sc = 1/25 - 1 = -24/25, so sc = -12/25, which I already have.Hmm, maybe I can find s - c. Let me think. If I can find (s - c)^2, that would be s² - 2sc + c². Since s² + c² is 1, then:(s - c)^2 = 1 - 2sc  Plugging in sc = -12/25:(s - c)^2 = 1 - 2*(-12/25) = 1 + 24/25 = 49/25  So, s - c = sqrt(49/25) = 7/5 or -7/5.But since α is between 0 and π, and sin α is positive in this interval. Also, since sin α + cos α is positive (1/5), and sin α is positive, cos α could be positive or negative. But looking at sin α cos α = -12/25, which is negative, so one of them is positive and the other is negative. Since sin α is positive (because 0 < α < π), cos α must be negative. Therefore, cos α is negative, so s - c = sin α - cos α would be positive because sin α is positive and cos α is negative. So, s - c = 7/5.Now, I have two equations:1. s + c = 1/5  2. s - c = 7/5I can solve these simultaneously. Let's add the two equations:(s + c) + (s - c) = 1/5 + 7/5  2s = 8/5  s = 4/5Now, substitute s = 4/5 into the first equation:4/5 + c = 1/5  c = 1/5 - 4/5  c = -3/5So, sin α = 4/5 and cos α = -3/5. Therefore, tan α = sin α / cos α = (4/5) / (-3/5) = -4/3.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from sin α + cos α = 1/5, I squared it to find sin α cos α = -12/25. Then, for part (I), I used the expression (sin α + cos α)/(sin α cos α) to get -5/12. For part (II), I found sin α and cos α by solving the system of equations, which gave me sin α = 4/5 and cos α = -3/5, leading to tan α = -4/3. Everything seems to check out.I think I'm confident with these answers. So, part (I) is -5/12 and part (II) is -4/3.**Final Answer**(I) boxed{-dfrac{5}{12}}  (II) boxed{-dfrac{4}{3}}"},{"question":"Find the value of ( n ) for which the following system of equations does not have a solution:[ nx + y = 2 ][ ny + z = 2 ][ x + n^2z = 2 ]**A)** ( -1 )  **B)** ( 0 )  **C)** ( 1 )  **D)** ( 0 text{ or } 1 )  **E)** ( frac{1}{2} )","answer":"Okay, so I have this system of equations:1. ( nx + y = 2 )2. ( ny + z = 2 )3. ( x + n^2 z = 2 )And I need to find the value of ( n ) for which this system doesn't have a solution. The options are A) -1, B) 0, C) 1, D) 0 or 1, E) 1/2.Hmm, let's see. I remember that a system of linear equations doesn't have a solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, and the system is inconsistent. So maybe I should write this system in matrix form and compute the determinant.First, let me write the coefficient matrix:[begin{bmatrix}n & 1 & 0 0 & n & 1 1 & 0 & n^2 end{bmatrix}]And the determinant of this matrix should be calculated. If the determinant is zero, the system might not have a unique solution, but it could still have infinitely many solutions or no solution depending on the constants on the right-hand side.So, let's compute the determinant:[text{det} = n cdot begin{vmatrix} n & 1  0 & n^2 end{vmatrix} - 1 cdot begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & n^2 end{vmatrix} + 0 cdot begin{vmatrix} 0 & n  1 & 0 end{vmatrix}]Calculating each minor:First minor: ( n cdot (n cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 0) = n cdot n^3 = n^4 )Second minor: ( -1 cdot (0 cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 1) = -1 cdot (-1) = 1 )Third minor: 0, so it doesn't contribute.So, determinant = ( n^4 + 1 )Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check.Wait, the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:[a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)]So, applying that:First element: ( n cdot (n cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 0) = n cdot n^3 = n^4 )Second element: ( -1 cdot (0 cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 1) = -1 cdot (-1) = 1 )Third element: ( 0 cdot (0 cdot 0 - n cdot 1) = 0 )So, determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ). Hmm, that seems correct.Wait, but ( n^4 + 1 ) is always positive for real numbers, right? Because any real number to the fourth power is non-negative, and adding 1 makes it at least 1. So the determinant is never zero. That means the system always has a unique solution, regardless of ( n ). But that contradicts the question, which says there is a value of ( n ) where the system doesn't have a solution.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant. Let me try again.Wait, let me write the matrix again:Row 1: ( n, 1, 0 )Row 2: ( 0, n, 1 )Row 3: ( 1, 0, n^2 )So, using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me use cofactor expansion along the first row.So, determinant = ( n cdot text{det} begin{bmatrix} n & 1  0 & n^2 end{bmatrix} - 1 cdot text{det} begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & n^2 end{bmatrix} + 0 cdot text{det} begin{bmatrix} 0 & n  1 & 0 end{bmatrix} )Calculating each minor:First minor: ( n cdot (n cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 0) = n cdot n^3 = n^4 )Second minor: ( -1 cdot (0 cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 1) = -1 cdot (-1) = 1 )Third minor: 0, so it's 0.So determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ). Hmm, same result.Wait, but if the determinant is never zero, then the system always has a unique solution, which contradicts the question. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.Alternatively, maybe the system can be inconsistent even if the determinant is non-zero? No, if the determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution. So perhaps the determinant is zero for some ( n ), but my calculation is wrong.Wait, let me check the determinant again. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.Wait, the cofactor expansion is:( a_{11} cdot M_{11} - a_{12} cdot M_{12} + a_{13} cdot M_{13} )So, ( n cdot M_{11} - 1 cdot M_{12} + 0 cdot M_{13} )Where ( M_{11} ) is the minor for element (1,1):[begin{vmatrix}n & 1 0 & n^2 end{vmatrix}= n cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 0 = n^3]So, ( n cdot n^3 = n^4 )( M_{12} ) is the minor for (1,2):[begin{vmatrix}0 & 1 1 & n^2 end{vmatrix}= 0 cdot n^2 - 1 cdot 1 = -1]So, ( -1 cdot (-1) = 1 )( M_{13} ) is the minor for (1,3):[begin{vmatrix}0 & n 1 & 0 end{vmatrix}= 0 cdot 0 - n cdot 1 = -n]But since the coefficient is 0, it doesn't matter.So, determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ), which is always positive, as I thought.Wait, but then the system always has a unique solution, so it should never be inconsistent. But the question says there is a value of ( n ) where it doesn't have a solution. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.Alternatively, perhaps the determinant is zero for some ( n ), but my calculation is wrong. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, maybe instead of using the determinant, I can try to solve the system step by step and see when it becomes inconsistent.Let me try substitution.From the first equation: ( y = 2 - nx )From the second equation: ( z = 2 - ny )From the third equation: ( x + n^2 z = 2 )So, substitute ( y ) from the first equation into the second equation:( z = 2 - n(2 - nx) = 2 - 2n + n^2 x )Now, substitute ( z ) into the third equation:( x + n^2 (2 - 2n + n^2 x) = 2 )Expand this:( x + 2n^2 - 2n^3 + n^4 x = 2 )Combine like terms:( x + n^4 x + 2n^2 - 2n^3 = 2 )Factor ( x ):( x(1 + n^4) + 2n^2 - 2n^3 = 2 )Now, solve for ( x ):( x(1 + n^4) = 2 - 2n^2 + 2n^3 )So,( x = frac{2 - 2n^2 + 2n^3}{1 + n^4} )Hmm, so as long as ( 1 + n^4 neq 0 ), which it never is for real ( n ), since ( n^4 ) is always non-negative, so ( 1 + n^4 ) is always at least 1. So, ( x ) is always defined.Then, we can find ( y ) and ( z ) from the earlier expressions.So, this suggests that the system always has a unique solution, regardless of ( n ). But the question says there is a value of ( n ) where the system doesn't have a solution. So, perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, maybe when ( n = -1 ), something happens? Let me try substituting ( n = -1 ) into the equations.First equation: ( -x + y = 2 )Second equation: ( -y + z = 2 )Third equation: ( x + (-1)^2 z = x + z = 2 )So, let's write them:1. ( -x + y = 2 )2. ( -y + z = 2 )3. ( x + z = 2 )Let me try to solve this system.From equation 1: ( y = x + 2 )From equation 2: ( z = y + 2 = (x + 2) + 2 = x + 4 )From equation 3: ( x + z = x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 = 2 )So, ( 2x + 4 = 2 ) => ( 2x = -2 ) => ( x = -1 )Then, ( y = -1 + 2 = 1 )And ( z = -1 + 4 = 3 )So, the solution is ( x = -1 ), ( y = 1 ), ( z = 3 ). So, even for ( n = -1 ), the system has a solution.Wait, but earlier, when I calculated the determinant, it was ( n^4 + 1 ), which for ( n = -1 ) is ( (-1)^4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ), which is non-zero, so the system has a unique solution.Hmm, so why does the question say there is a value of ( n ) where the system doesn't have a solution? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.Wait, perhaps the system is overdetermined or something? No, it's three equations with three variables, so it's a square system.Wait, maybe if ( n = 0 ), let's see.If ( n = 0 ), the equations become:1. ( 0x + y = 2 ) => ( y = 2 )2. ( 0y + z = 2 ) => ( z = 2 )3. ( x + 0^2 z = x = 2 )So, ( x = 2 ), ( y = 2 ), ( z = 2 ). So, it's consistent.Wait, maybe ( n = 1 )?Let me try ( n = 1 ):1. ( x + y = 2 )2. ( y + z = 2 )3. ( x + z = 2 )Let me solve this system.From equation 1: ( y = 2 - x )From equation 2: ( z = 2 - y = 2 - (2 - x) = x )From equation 3: ( x + z = x + x = 2x = 2 ) => ( x = 1 )Then, ( y = 2 - 1 = 1 ), ( z = 1 ). So, solution is ( x = 1 ), ( y = 1 ), ( z = 1 ). So, it's consistent.Wait, so for ( n = -1, 0, 1 ), the system has solutions. So, why does the question say there is a value of ( n ) where it doesn't have a solution?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant. Let me double-check.Wait, the determinant was ( n^4 + 1 ), which is always positive, so the system always has a unique solution. So, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.Wait, looking back at the options, A is -1, B is 0, C is 1, D is 0 or 1, E is 1/2.But according to my calculations, all these values of ( n ) result in a system with a unique solution.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \\"does not have a solution\\". Maybe it means no solution, not infinitely many or unique.But if the determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution, so it always has a solution. So, perhaps the answer is that there is no such ( n ), but that's not an option.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me try again.Wait, the determinant is:[begin{vmatrix}n & 1 & 0 0 & n & 1 1 & 0 & n^2 end{vmatrix}]Using the rule of Sarrus:First, write the matrix twice:n 1 0 | n 1 00 n 1 | 0 n 11 0 n^2 | 1 0 n^2Now, sum the diagonals from top left:n * n * n^2 + 1 * 1 * 1 + 0 * 0 * 0 = n^4 + 1 + 0 = n^4 + 1Subtract the diagonals from top right:0 * n * 1 + 1 * 0 * n^2 + n * 1 * 1 = 0 + 0 + n = nSo, determinant = (n^4 + 1) - nWait, that's different from before. So, determinant is ( n^4 - n + 1 )Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the rule of Sarrus is for 3x3 matrices, and it's a shortcut, but maybe I'm applying it incorrectly.Wait, actually, the rule of Sarrus is:For a 3x3 matrix:a b cd e fg h iThe determinant is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)So, applying that:a = n, b = 1, c = 0d = 0, e = n, f = 1g = 1, h = 0, i = n^2So,det = n*(n*n^2 - 1*0) - 1*(0*n^2 - 1*1) + 0*(0*0 - n*1)= n*(n^3) - 1*(-1) + 0= n^4 + 1So, same as before. So, determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ), which is always positive, so the system always has a unique solution.Wait, but the question says \\"does not have a solution\\". So, maybe the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.Wait, maybe the system is inconsistent for some ( n ). But if the determinant is non-zero, the system is consistent and has a unique solution. So, perhaps the answer is that there is no such ( n ), but that's not an option.Wait, looking back at the options, maybe the answer is A) -1, but earlier when I tried ( n = -1 ), the system had a solution. So, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me try solving the system again for ( n = -1 ):1. ( -x + y = 2 )2. ( -y + z = 2 )3. ( x + z = 2 )From equation 1: ( y = x + 2 )From equation 2: ( z = y + 2 = x + 4 )From equation 3: ( x + z = x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 = 2 ) => ( 2x = -2 ) => ( x = -1 )Then, ( y = -1 + 2 = 1 ), ( z = -1 + 4 = 3 ). So, solution exists.Wait, maybe the question is about the system being inconsistent, but in that case, the determinant would have to be zero, which it's not. So, perhaps the answer is that there is no such ( n ), but that's not an option.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's write the system as:1. ( nx + y = 2 )2. ( ny + z = 2 )3. ( x + n^2 z = 2 )Let me express ( y ) from equation 1: ( y = 2 - nx )Substitute into equation 2: ( n(2 - nx) + z = 2 ) => ( 2n - n^2 x + z = 2 ) => ( z = 2 - 2n + n^2 x )Substitute ( z ) into equation 3: ( x + n^2 (2 - 2n + n^2 x) = 2 )Expand: ( x + 2n^2 - 2n^3 + n^4 x = 2 )Combine like terms: ( x(1 + n^4) + 2n^2 - 2n^3 = 2 )So, ( x = frac{2 - 2n^2 + 2n^3}{1 + n^4} )Now, let's see if this expression is valid for all ( n ). Since ( 1 + n^4 ) is always positive, ( x ) is defined for all real ( n ). Therefore, the system always has a solution.Wait, but the question says \\"does not have a solution\\". So, perhaps the answer is that there is no such ( n ), but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong.Wait, looking back at the options, maybe the answer is A) -1, but when I tried ( n = -1 ), the system had a solution. So, perhaps the answer is A) -1, but I'm not sure why.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try solving the system again for ( n = -1 ):1. ( -x + y = 2 )2. ( -y + z = 2 )3. ( x + z = 2 )From equation 1: ( y = x + 2 )From equation 2: ( z = y + 2 = x + 4 )From equation 3: ( x + z = x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 = 2 ) => ( 2x = -2 ) => ( x = -1 )Then, ( y = -1 + 2 = 1 ), ( z = -1 + 4 = 3 ). So, solution exists.Wait, maybe the answer is A) -1, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for when the system has infinitely many solutions, but that's not what it says.Wait, maybe I should check the determinant again. If determinant is zero, the system might be inconsistent or have infinitely many solutions. But since determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ), which is never zero, the system always has a unique solution.So, perhaps the answer is that there is no such ( n ), but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is A) -1, but I'm not sure why.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me try again.Wait, the determinant is:[begin{vmatrix}n & 1 & 0 0 & n & 1 1 & 0 & n^2 end{vmatrix}]Using cofactor expansion along the third row:( 1 cdot begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0  n & 1 end{vmatrix} - 0 cdot begin{vmatrix} n & 0  0 & 1 end{vmatrix} + n^2 cdot begin{vmatrix} n & 1  0 & n end{vmatrix} )Calculating each minor:First minor: ( 1 cdot (1 cdot 1 - 0 cdot n) = 1 cdot 1 = 1 )Second minor: 0, so it's 0Third minor: ( n^2 cdot (n cdot n - 1 cdot 0) = n^2 cdot n^2 = n^4 )So, determinant = ( 1 + n^4 ), same as before.So, determinant is ( n^4 + 1 ), which is always positive, so the system always has a unique solution.Therefore, the answer should be that there is no such ( n ), but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is A) -1, but I don't see why.Wait, maybe the question is about the system being inconsistent when ( n = -1 ), but when I solved it, it was consistent.

( (1/2)x + y = 2 )2. ( (1/2)y + z = 2 )3. ( x + (1/2)^2 z = x + (1/4)z = 2 )Let me solve this system.From equation 1: ( y = 2 - (1/2)x )From equation 2: ( z = 2 - (1/2)y = 2 - (1/2)(2 - (1/2)x) = 2 - 1 + (1/4)x = 1 + (1/4)x )From equation 3: ( x + (1/4)z = x + (1/4)(1 + (1/4)x) = x + 1/4 + (1/16)x = (17/16)x + 1/4 = 2 )So, ( (17/16)x = 2 - 1/4 = 7/4 ) => ( x = (7/4) * (16/17) = 28/17 )Then, ( y = 2 - (1/2)(28/17) = 2 - 14/17 = 20/17 )And ( z = 1 + (1/4)(28/17) = 1 + 7/17 = 24/17 )So, solution exists.Wait, so for ( n = 1/2 ), the system also has a solution.Hmm, I'm confused. According to my calculations, for all values of ( n ), the system has a unique solution. So, the answer should be that there is no such ( n ), but that's not an option.Wait, maybe the question is about the system being inconsistent when ( n = -1 ), but when I solved it, it was consistent. So, perhaps the answer is A) -1, but I don't see why.Alternatively, maybe the answer is A) -1 because when ( n = -1 ), the determinant is 2, which is non-zero, but the system is consistent. So, I don't know why the answer would be A) -1.Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. The options are A) -1, B) 0, C) 1, D) 0 or 1, E) 1/2.Since all these values of ( n ) result in a system with a unique solution, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.

The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of frac{1}{2}. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square EFGH that is closest to the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a square EFGH. The center of the square is at (5, 3), and the area is 16 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. Then, the square is dilated with the center of dilation at (0,0) and a scale factor of 1/2. I need to find the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square EFGH that is closest to the origin after the dilation. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, since the area of the square is 16, the side length must be the square root of 16, which is 4 units. That makes sense because area of a square is side squared, so side length is 4. Now, the square is centered at (5, 3), and the top side is horizontal. So, I need to figure out the coordinates of the four vertices of the square.Since the center is at (5, 3), and the side length is 4, each side extends 2 units from the center in all directions. Because the top side is horizontal, the square is aligned with the coordinate axes, meaning its sides are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.So, starting from the center (5, 3), moving 2 units to the right, left, up, and down will give me the vertices. Let me visualize this: the center is (5, 3). Moving 2 units up would take me to (5, 5), 2 units down to (5, 1), 2 units right to (7, 3), and 2 units left to (3, 3). But wait, these are just the midpoints of the sides, not the vertices.Since each side is 4 units long, the vertices should be at the corners. So, from the center, moving 2 units in both x and y directions. Let me think: the top right vertex would be 2 units right and 2 units up from the center, so that's (5+2, 3+2) = (7,5). Similarly, the top left would be (5-2, 3+2) = (3,5). The bottom right would be (5+2, 3-2) = (7,1), and the bottom left would be (5-2, 3-2) = (3,1). Okay, so the four vertices are (7,5), (3,5), (7,1), and (3,1).Now, the square is going to be dilated with the center of dilation at (0,0) and a scale factor of 1/2. Dilation means that each point is moved along the line connecting it to the center of dilation, scaled by the factor. So, for each vertex, I need to apply the dilation.The formula for dilation is: if you have a point (x, y) and you dilate it with center (0,0) and scale factor k, the new point is (k*x, k*y). So, in this case, k is 1/2. Therefore, each coordinate of the vertices will be multiplied by 1/2.Let me compute the new coordinates after dilation:1. For (7,5): new x = 7*(1/2) = 3.5, new y = 5*(1/2) = 2.5. So, (3.5, 2.5).2. For (3,5): new x = 3*(1/2) = 1.5, new y = 5*(1/2) = 2.5. So, (1.5, 2.5).3. For (7,1): new x = 7*(1/2) = 3.5, new y = 1*(1/2) = 0.5. So, (3.5, 0.5).4. For (3,1): new x = 3*(1/2) = 1.5, new y = 1*(1/2) = 0.5. So, (1.5, 0.5).So, after dilation, the four vertices are (3.5, 2.5), (1.5, 2.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (1.5, 0.5).Now, I need to find which of these four points is closest to the origin (0,0). To do that, I can calculate the distance from each point to the origin using the distance formula: distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The point with the smallest distance is the closest one.Let me compute the distances:1. For (3.5, 2.5):   Distance = sqrt((3.5)^2 + (2.5)^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 6.25) = sqrt(18.5) ≈ 4.301.2. For (1.5, 2.5):   Distance = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (2.5)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 6.25) = sqrt(8.5) ≈ 2.915.3. For (3.5, 0.5):   Distance = sqrt((3.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(12.5) ≈ 3.536.4. For (1.5, 0.5):   Distance = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5) ≈ 1.581.Comparing these distances: approximately 4.301, 2.915, 3.536, and 1.581. The smallest distance is approximately 1.581, which corresponds to the point (1.5, 0.5).Therefore, the vertex of the image of square EFGH that is closest to the origin after the dilation is (1.5, 0.5).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the original square: center at (5,3), area 16, so side 4. The vertices are correctly calculated as (7,5), (3,5), (7,1), and (3,1). Then, applying dilation with scale factor 1/2 from (0,0), each coordinate is halved, resulting in (3.5,2.5), (1.5,2.5), (3.5,0.5), and (1.5,0.5). Calculating distances:- (3.5,2.5): sqrt(12.25 + 6.25) = sqrt(18.5) ≈ 4.301- (1.5,2.5): sqrt(2.25 + 6.25) = sqrt(8.5) ≈ 2.915- (3.5,0.5): sqrt(12.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(12.5) ≈ 3.536- (1.5,0.5): sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5) ≈ 1.581Yes, that seems correct. So, (1.5,0.5) is indeed the closest point to the origin after dilation.I think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my calculations. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that (1.5, 0.5) is the correct answer."},{"question":"Cole drove from home to work at an average speed of 75 km/h. He then returned home at an average speed of 105 km/h.

Then find f_{2014}(x) = A: sin{x} + e^x  B: cos{x} + e^x  C: -sin{x} + e^x  D: -cos{x} + e^x","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a function f(x) = sin(x) + e^x + x^2013. Then, they define f1(x) as the first derivative of f(x), f2(x) as the second derivative, and so on, up to f2014(x). I need to find what f2014(x) is, and the options are given as A: sin(x) + e^x, B: cos(x) + e^x, C: -sin(x) + e^x, and D: -cos(x) + e^x.Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what taking the derivative multiple times does to each part of the function. The function has three parts: sin(x), e^x, and x^2013. I know that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). The derivative of e^x is always e^x, which is interesting because it doesn't change. For the polynomial part, x^2013, each derivative will reduce the exponent by one and multiply by the current exponent. So the first derivative would be 2013x^2012, the second derivative would be 2013*2012x^2011, and so on.Now, since we're taking the derivative 2014 times, I need to see what happens to each part after that many derivatives. Starting with sin(x): every time I take the derivative, it alternates between cos(x) and -sin(x). So, the first derivative is cos(x), the second is -sin(x), the third is -cos(x), the fourth is sin(x), and then it repeats every four derivatives. So, if I take the derivative 2014 times, I need to see where 2014 falls in this cycle.Similarly, for e^x, since its derivative is always e^x, no matter how many times I take the derivative, it will still be e^x.For the polynomial part, x^2013: each derivative reduces the exponent by one and multiplies by the current exponent. So, after 2013 derivatives, the polynomial part would become zero because we'd have taken the derivative 2013 times, reducing the exponent to zero, which is a constant, and then the next derivative would make it zero. Therefore, after 2014 derivatives, the polynomial part would be zero.So, focusing on the trigonometric part, sin(x), after 2014 derivatives, I need to determine what it becomes. Since the cycle repeats every four derivatives, I can divide 2014 by 4 to see the remainder. 2014 divided by 4 is 503 with a remainder of 2. So, the first derivative is cos(x), the second is -sin(x). Therefore, after 2014 derivatives, the trigonometric part would be -sin(x).Putting it all together, the 2014th derivative of f(x) would be -sin(x) + e^x. Looking at the options, that's option C.Wait, let me double-check. The first derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), second is -sin(x), third is -cos(x), fourth is sin(x). So, every four derivatives, it cycles back. 2014 divided by 4 is 503 with a remainder of 2, so it's like taking two derivatives. First derivative: cos(x), second derivative: -sin(x). So yes, after 2014 derivatives, it's -sin(x). And e^x remains e^x. The polynomial part is gone because we've taken enough derivatives to reduce it to zero. So, f2014(x) should be -sin(x) + e^x, which is option C."},{"question":"Calculate: -20m^{6}div 5m^{2}=______.","answer":"First, I need to divide the coefficients of the terms.

When dividing like bases with exponents, I subtract the exponents: ( 6 - 2 = 4 ). This means ( m^6 div m^2 = m^4 ).Finally, I combine the results from the coefficients and the variable part. Multiplying -4 by ( m^4 ) gives me the final simplified expression: ( -4m^4 )."},{"question":"Among the following functions, the one that increases the fastest as x increases is (　　)A: y=0.001e^xB: y=1000ln xC: y=x^{1000}D: y=1000cdot 2^x","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which function increases the fastest as x increases. The options are A: y = 0.001e^x, B: y = 1000 ln x, C: y = x^1000, and D: y = 1000·2^x. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that different types of functions grow at different rates. I think logarithmic functions, like option B, grow the slowest. Then, power functions, like option C, grow faster than logarithmic functions. And exponential functions, which are options A and D, grow the fastest. So, I can probably eliminate options B and C because they're not exponential.Now, between A and D, both are exponential functions, but they have different bases. Option A has a base of e (approximately 2.718) and a coefficient of 0.001, while option D has a base of 2 and a coefficient of 1000. I know that the base of an exponential function affects its growth rate. The larger the base, the faster it grows, right? So, e is about 2.718, which is bigger than 2, so e^x should grow faster than 2^x. But wait, option A has a smaller coefficient, 0.001, compared to D's 1000. Does that matter?Let me think. The coefficient affects the initial value of the function but not the growth rate itself. For example, 0.001e^x starts off much smaller than 1000·2^x, but as x increases, the exponential term dominates. So, even though 0.001 is small, e^x grows faster than 2^x, so eventually, A should overtake D. But is that true?Wait, maybe I should compare their derivatives to see which one is increasing faster. The derivative of A is 0.001e^x, and the derivative of D is 1000·ln(2)·2^x. Let me compute the ratio of their derivatives to see which one grows faster.So, the derivative of A over derivative of D is (0.001e^x) / (1000·ln(2)·2^x) = (0.001 / (1000·ln(2))) * (e/2)^x. Simplifying, 0.001 / 1000 is 0.000001, and ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So, the coefficient becomes roughly 0.000001 / 0.693 ≈ 1.443e-6. Then, (e/2)^x is approximately (1.359)^x. So, the ratio is 1.443e-6 * (1.359)^x.Now, as x increases, (1.359)^x grows exponentially, which means that the ratio will eventually become greater than 1, meaning that the derivative of A will surpass the derivative of D. But how quickly does that happen? For small x, the coefficient 1.443e-6 is very small, so the derivative of D is much larger. But as x increases, the exponential term will dominate, and A's derivative will eventually be larger.But does this mean that A increases faster than D for all sufficiently large x? Yes, because exponential functions with larger bases will eventually outpace those with smaller bases, regardless of the coefficients. So, even though D starts off growing much faster due to the larger coefficient, A will eventually surpass it because e > 2.Wait, but in the original functions, A is 0.001e^x and D is 1000·2^x. So, at x=0, A is 0.001 and D is 1000. At x=1, A is 0.001e ≈ 0.002718 and D is 1000·2 = 2000. At x=10, A is 0.001e^10 ≈ 0.001·22026 ≈ 22.026 and D is 1000·2^10 = 1000·1024 = 1,024,000. So, D is still way bigger.But as x increases further, say x=20, A is 0.001e^20 ≈ 0.001·4.85165195e8 ≈ 485,165.195 and D is 1000·2^20 = 1000·1,048,576 = 1,048,576,000. So, D is still bigger.Wait, but e^x grows faster than 2^x, so at some point, A should overtake D. Let me solve for x when 0.001e^x = 1000·2^x.Taking natural logs: ln(0.001) + x = ln(1000) + x ln(2).So, ln(0.001) is -6.907755, ln(1000) is 6.907755, and ln(2) is 0.693147.So, -6.907755 + x = 6.907755 + 0.693147x.Subtract 0.693147x from both sides: -6.907755 + x - 0.693147x = 6.907755.Simplify: -6.907755 + 0.306853x = 6.907755.Add 6.907755 to both sides: 0.306853x = 13.81551.So, x ≈ 13.81551 / 0.306853 ≈ 45.So, at x≈45, A and D are equal. After that, A will be larger. But before that, D is larger.But the question is about which function increases the fastest as x increases. So, even though D is larger for x < 45, its growth rate is slower than A's because e > 2. So, the derivative of A will eventually be larger than the derivative of D, meaning A is increasing faster for large x.But does that mean A is the answer? Or is D still the answer because it's larger for most practical x?Wait, the question is about the function that increases the fastest as x increases. So, it's about the growth rate, not the actual value. So, even though D is larger for smaller x, A's growth rate is higher because e > 2. So, A increases faster than D for sufficiently large x.But let me check the derivatives again. The derivative of A is 0.001e^x, and the derivative of D is 1000·ln(2)·2^x. So, which derivative is larger?We can compare 0.001e^x and 1000·ln(2)·2^x.Let me take the ratio: (0.001e^x) / (1000·ln(2)·2^x) = (0.001 / (1000·ln(2))) * (e/2)^x.As x increases, (e/2)^x grows exponentially, so eventually, this ratio will exceed 1, meaning that the derivative of A will surpass the derivative of D. So, for large enough x, A's derivative is larger, meaning A is increasing faster.Therefore, even though D is larger for smaller x, A's growth rate is higher, so A increases faster as x increases.Wait, but in the initial analysis, the assistant said that among exponential functions, the larger the base, the faster the growth rate, so A is correct. But in my calculation, I found that D is larger until x≈45, but after that, A overtakes.But the question is about which function increases the fastest as x increases, not which one is larger. So, it's about the growth rate, not the actual value. So, even though D is larger for smaller x, A's growth rate is higher because e > 2. So, A is increasing faster for large x.But let me think again. The coefficient in A is 0.001, which is much smaller than D's 1000. So, does that affect the growth rate? I think the coefficient affects the initial value but not the growth rate itself. The growth rate is determined by the base of the exponential function.So, for exponential functions, the growth rate is proportional to the base. So, e^x grows faster than 2^x because e > 2. The coefficients just scale the function up or down but don't change the growth rate.Therefore, even though D starts off much larger, A's growth rate is higher, so A will eventually overtake D and continue to grow faster.So, putting it all together, the functions that are not exponential can be eliminated first. Then, between the exponential functions, the one with the larger base grows faster. So, A is the answer.Wait, but in the initial analysis, the assistant said A is correct, but I thought D might be because of the larger coefficient. But now, after analyzing, I think A is correct because the base e is larger than 2, so e^x grows faster than 2^x, despite the smaller coefficient.So, I think the correct answer is A."},{"question":"Two trains are moving in opposite directions with speeds of 110 km/hr and 90 km/hr respectively.

The relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.Next, I'll calculate the combined length of both trains, as this is the total distance that needs to be covered for one train to completely pass the other.After obtaining the relative speed and the combined length, I'll use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, to find out how long it takes for the slower train to cross the faster train.Finally, I'll ensure that the units are consistent and present the final answer in the required format."},{"question":"Find the number of x-intercepts on the graph of y = sin frac{2}{x} (evaluated in terms of radians) in the interval (0.0002, 0.002).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(2/x) in the interval (0.0002, 0.002). Hmm, x-intercepts occur where y = 0, so that means I need to solve sin(2/x) = 0.I remember that sin(θ) = 0 when θ is an integer multiple of π. So, 2/x must equal kπ, where k is an integer. That gives me x = 2/(kπ). Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0002, 0.002). So, I can set up inequalities:0.0002 < 2/(kπ) < 0.002I need to solve for k. Let me rearrange the inequalities. Starting with the left side:0.0002 < 2/(kπ)Multiply both sides by kπ (assuming k is positive, which it should be because x is positive in the interval):0.0002 * kπ < 2Divide both sides by 0.0002:kπ < 2 / 0.0002Calculate 2 / 0.0002. Well, 2 divided by 0.0002 is the same as 2 * 5000, which is 10,000. So:kπ < 10,000Divide both sides by π:k < 10,000 / πSimilarly, for the right side of the inequality:2/(kπ) < 0.002Multiply both sides by kπ:2 < 0.002 * kπDivide both sides by 0.002:2 / 0.002 < kπCalculate 2 / 0.002, which is 1000. So:1000 < kπDivide both sides by π:1000 / π < kSo, putting it all together, k must satisfy:1000 / π < k < 10,000 / πNow, I need to find the integer values of k in this range. Let me compute these bounds numerically.First, calculate 1000 / π. I know π is approximately 3.1415926535, so:1000 / 3.1415926535 ≈ 318.309886184Similarly, 10,000 / π ≈ 3183.09886184So, k must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.Since k must be an integer, the smallest integer k can be is 319, and the largest integer k can be is 3183.Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I subtract 318 from 3183 because 319 is the first integer after 318.309886184.So, 3183 - 318 = 2865.Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of k that satisfy the inequality, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Calculating 1000 / π: 1000 divided by 3.1415926535 is indeed approximately 318.309886184.Similarly, 10,000 / π is 10 times that, so approximately 3183.09886184.So, k starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.If I subtract 318 from 3183, I get 2865, but actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, it should be 3183 - 319 + 1.Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, my initial calculation was correct.Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865."},{"question":"A proposed new 5 coin is called the \\"foonie\\".

Okay, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it means to simplify an expression like this. Simplifying usually involves expanding the terms and then combining like terms if possible.So, starting with the first part: 3a multiplied by (3a cubed plus 2a squared). I remember that when you have something like this, you need to distribute the 3a to both terms inside the parentheses. That means I'll multiply 3a by 3a cubed and then 3a by 2a squared.Let me write that out:3a * 3a³ = ?Hmm, multiplying 3a by 3a³. I think when you multiply variables with exponents, you add the exponents. So, a times a³ is a^(1+3) = a⁴. And 3 times 3 is 9. So, that should be 9a⁴.Next, 3a * 2a². Again, multiplying the coefficients first: 3 times 2 is 6. Then, a times a² is a^(1+2) = a³. So, that gives me 6a³.Okay, so after expanding the first part, I have 9a⁴ plus 6a³.Now, moving on to the second part of the expression: minus 2a squared times (b squared plus 1). I need to distribute the -2a² to both terms inside the parentheses.So, -2a² * b² = ?Multiplying -2a² by b². The coefficients: -2 times 1 is -2. Then, a² times b² is a²b². So, that gives me -2a²b².Next, -2a² * 1. That's straightforward: -2a² times 1 is just -2a².So, after expanding the second part, I have -2a²b² minus 2a².Now, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:9a⁴ + 6a³ - 2a²b² - 2a².Now, I need to see if there are any like terms that I can combine. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers.Looking at the terms:- 9a⁴: This is the only term with a⁴.- 6a³: This is the only term with a³.- -2a²b²: This term has both a² and b².- -2a²: This is the only term with just a².Hmm, I don't see any like terms that can be combined here. The term with a²b² is unique because it has both a and b, and the other a² term doesn't have a b. So, I can't combine those. Similarly, the a⁴ and a³ terms are distinct.Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:9a⁴ + 6a³ - 2a²b² - 2a².I think that's as simplified as it gets because there are no like terms left to combine. I should double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in distributing or combining like terms.Let me go back through each step:1. Expanded 3a(3a³ + 2a²):   - 3a * 3a³ = 9a⁴   - 3a * 2a² = 6a³   - So, 9a⁴ + 6a³. That looks correct.2. Expanded -2a²(b² + 1):   - -2a² * b² = -2a²b²   - -2a² * 1 = -2a²   - So, -2a²b² - 2a². That also looks correct.3. Combined all terms:   - 9a⁴ + 6a³ - 2a²b² - 2a²   - Checked for like terms and found none to combine.Everything seems to add up. I don't think I missed anything. So, I'm confident that this is the simplified form of the original expression."},{"question":"Find the larger of the two distinct solutions to the equation x^2 - 19x - 48 = 0.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: x squared minus 19x minus 48 equals zero. I need to find the larger of the two distinct solutions. Hmm, quadratic equations, right? I remember there are a few ways to solve them: factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. I think factoring is usually the quickest if the numbers work out nicely, but sometimes it's not so straightforward. Let me try factoring first.Alright, the equation is x² - 19x - 48 = 0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -48 and add up to -19. Let me think about the factors of 48. 48 can be broken down into 1 and 48, 2 and 24, 3 and 16, 4 and 12, 6 and 8. Since the product is negative, one number has to be positive and the other negative.Let me try 24 and 3. If I take -24 and +3, their product is -72, which is not -48. Hmm, that's not right. Maybe I need to adjust. What if I try 16 and 3? If I take -16 and +3, their product is -48, and their sum is -13. That's not -19 either. Okay, maybe 12 and 4? If I take -12 and +4, their product is -48, and their sum is -8. Still not -19.Wait, maybe I need to go higher. Let me try 24 and 2. If I take -24 and +2, their product is -48, and their sum is -22. That's too low. Hmm, what about 16 and 3? Wait, I already tried that. Maybe 8 and 6? If I take -8 and +6, their product is -48, and their sum is -2. Not close enough.This is getting frustrating. Maybe factoring isn't the best approach here. Let me try the quadratic formula instead. The quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. In this equation, a is 1, b is -19, and c is -48.So plugging in the values: x equals negative (-19) plus or minus the square root of (-19) squared minus four times 1 times (-48), all over 2 times 1. Simplifying that, x equals 19 plus or minus the square root of 361 plus 192, over 2. Wait, because negative times negative is positive, so four times a times c is 4*1*(-48) which is -192, but since it's minus that, it becomes plus 192.So the discriminant is 361 plus 192, which is 553. So x equals 19 plus or minus the square root of 553 over 2. Hmm, square root of 553 is approximately... let me see, 23 squared is 529 and 24 squared is 576, so it's somewhere between 23 and 24. Maybe around 23.5.So, x equals (19 + 23.5)/2 and (19 - 23.5)/2. Calculating the first one: 19 + 23.5 is 42.5, divided by 2 is 21.25. The second one: 19 - 23.5 is -4.5, divided by 2 is -2.25. So the two solutions are approximately 21.25 and -2.25. Therefore, the larger solution is 21.25.Wait, but the problem asks for the exact value, not an approximate. So I need to express it in terms of square roots. So x equals (19 + sqrt(553))/2 and (19 - sqrt(553))/2. Since sqrt(553) is positive, the larger solution is (19 + sqrt(553))/2.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the quadratic formula: x = [19 ± sqrt(361 + 192)] / 2. 361 plus 192 is indeed 553. So that part is correct. And since sqrt(553) is approximately 23.5, adding that to 19 gives about 42.5, divided by 2 is 21.25. Subtracting gives a negative number, so the larger solution is definitely the positive one.I think that's it. So the exact larger solution is (19 + sqrt(553))/2, which is approximately 21.25."},{"question":"Consider the equation y = mx + 3 on an xy-coordinate system, where each point (x, y) has integer coordinates.

The options given are A) 1/3, B) 17/51, C) 1/2, D) 18/53, and E) 16/47.First, I need to understand what it means for the line y = mx + 3 to pass through a lattice point. A lattice point is a point (x, y) where both x and y are integers. So, for the line to pass through such a point, when x is an integer between 1 and 50, y must also be an integer.Given the equation y = mx + 3, if x is an integer, then y will be an integer if and only if mx is an integer because 3 is already an integer. So, mx must be an integer. That means m must be a rational number such that when multiplied by some integer x (from 1 to 50), it results in an integer.Let me express m as a fraction in its simplest form. Let m = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is reduced). Then, for mx to be an integer, q must divide x. So, for each x from 1 to 50, if q divides x, then y will be an integer.Therefore, to ensure that the line doesn't pass through any lattice points for x from 1 to 50, m must be such that q does not divide any x in that range. In other words, q must be greater than 50 because if q were less than or equal to 50, there would be some x (specifically, x = q) where q divides x, making y an integer.So, m must be a fraction where the denominator q is greater than 50. But m also has to be greater than 1/3. So, I need to find the smallest fraction greater than 1/3 where the denominator is greater than 50. The maximum value of 'a' would then be just before the next fraction that could potentially cause y to be an integer for some x between 1 and 50.Let me think about how to find such fractions. The fractions just above 1/3 with denominators greater than 50. One way to approach this is to consider fractions of the form (n + 1)/(3n + 1). Let me test this.For example, if n = 16, then the fraction is (16 + 1)/(3*16 + 1) = 17/49. Wait, 49 is less than 50, so that's not good because 49 divides x = 49, which is within our range. So, maybe n = 17? Then, (17 + 1)/(3*17 + 1) = 18/52, which simplifies to 9/26. But 26 is less than 50, so that's still a problem because x = 26 would make y an integer.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about continued fractions or Farey sequences. The Farey sequence of order n is the set of reduced fractions between 0 and 1 with denominators less than or equal to n. The mediant of two fractions a/b and c/d is (a + c)/(b + d). The mediant lies between the two fractions.Since I'm looking for the fraction just above 1/3 with denominator greater than 50, I can use the Farey sequence approach. The fraction just above 1/3 would be the one with the smallest numerator and denominator such that the denominator is greater than 50 and the fraction is just above 1/3.Let me set up the inequality: 1/3 < p/q < a, where q > 50. I need to find the smallest p/q greater than 1/3 with q > 50.To find such a fraction, I can use the concept of continued fractions or the floor function. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the next fraction in the Farey sequence.Let me try to find the smallest p/q greater than 1/3 with q > 50.Starting with 1/3, I can look for the next fraction by incrementing the numerator and denominator appropriately.Let me consider q = 51. What's the smallest p such that p/51 > 1/3?Solving for p: p > 51/3 = 17. So, p = 18. Therefore, 18/51 simplifies to 6/17, which is approximately 0.3529. But 6/17 is less than 1/2, which is 0.5. Wait, but 18/51 is the same as 6/17, which is approximately 0.3529. But 17/51 is 1/3, which is exactly 0.3333. So, 18/51 is the next fraction after 17/51 (which is 1/3) with denominator 51.But 18/51 simplifies to 6/17, which is approximately 0.3529. However, 6/17 is still less than 1/2, so it's a valid candidate. But I need to check if there's a fraction between 1/3 and 18/51 with a denominator greater than 50.Wait, 18/51 is the first fraction after 1/3 with denominator 51. Is there a fraction between 1/3 and 18/51 with a denominator greater than 50? Let me check.For example, let's consider q = 52. What's the smallest p such that p/52 > 1/3?p > 52/3 ≈ 17.333, so p = 18. Therefore, 18/52 simplifies to 9/26 ≈ 0.3462, which is still greater than 1/3 and less than 18/51 ≈ 0.3529.Wait, so 9/26 is between 1/3 and 18/51. But 9/26 has a denominator of 26, which is less than 50. So, that's not acceptable because q needs to be greater than 50.So, maybe I need to look for fractions with denominators greater than 50 that are just above 1/3.Let me try q = 53. What's the smallest p such that p/53 > 1/3?p > 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so p = 18. Therefore, 18/53 ≈ 0.3396. That's just above 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.Is 18/53 in its simplest form? Let's check if 18 and 53 have any common factors. 53 is a prime number, and 18 is 2*3^2, so no common factors. So, 18/53 is in simplest terms.Now, is there a fraction between 1/3 and 18/53 with a denominator greater than 50? Let's check q = 54.p > 54/3 = 18, so p = 19. 19/54 ≈ 0.3519. That's greater than 18/53 ≈ 0.3396, so it's not between 1/3 and 18/53.Wait, actually, 19/54 is greater than 18/53 because 19*53 = 1007 and 18*54 = 972, so 1007 > 972, meaning 19/54 > 18/53.So, 18/53 is the next fraction after 1/3 with denominator 53.But wait, let's check q = 51 again. 18/51 = 6/17 ≈ 0.3529. Is there a fraction between 1/3 and 6/17 with denominator greater than 50?For q = 52, we have 18/52 = 9/26 ≈ 0.3462, which is between 1/3 and 6/17. But 9/26 has a denominator of 26, which is less than 50, so it's not acceptable.Similarly, for q = 53, we have 18/53 ≈ 0.3396, which is just above 1/3.Wait, so 18/53 is the first fraction after 1/3 with denominator greater than 50. Therefore, the maximum value of 'a' would be just before 18/53, but since we need 'a' such that for all m between 1/3 and a, the line doesn't pass through any lattice points, 'a' would be 18/53.But wait, let me check the options given. The options are A) 1/3, B) 17/51, C) 1/2, D) 18/53, E) 16/47.So, D is 18/53, which seems to be the answer based on my previous reasoning.But let me double-check. If m is just less than 18/53, say m = 18/53 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number, then for x = 53, y would be just less than 18 + 3 = 21, which is not an integer. Wait, but x only goes up to 50, so x = 53 is beyond our range. Therefore, for x from 1 to 50, m = 18/53 would not cause y to be an integer because 18/53 * x would not be an integer for any x from 1 to 50, since 53 is a prime number and doesn't divide any x in that range.Wait, but 18/53 is approximately 0.3396, which is just above 1/3. So, if we set a = 18/53, then for any m between 1/3 and 18/53, the line y = mx + 3 won't pass through any lattice points for x from 1 to 50.But let me check if there's a fraction between 1/3 and 18/53 with a denominator less than or equal to 50 that could cause y to be an integer. For example, 17/51 is 1/3, so that's exactly 1/3. The next fraction would be 18/51, which simplifies to 6/17 ≈ 0.3529, but 6/17 has a denominator of 17, which is less than 50, so x = 17 would make y = 6 + 3 = 9, which is an integer. Therefore, m = 6/17 would cause the line to pass through (17, 9), which is a lattice point. So, we need to avoid m = 6/17.Wait, but 6/17 is approximately 0.3529, which is greater than 18/53 ≈ 0.3396. So, if we set a = 18/53, then m would be less than 18/53, which is less than 6/17. Therefore, m would not reach 6/17, so the line wouldn't pass through (17, 9).But wait, let me think again. If a is 18/53, then m can be up to just below 18/53. But 18/53 is approximately 0.3396, which is less than 6/17 ≈ 0.3529. So, m would never reach 6/17, so the line wouldn't pass through (17, 9). Therefore, setting a = 18/53 would ensure that for all m between 1/3 and 18/53, the line doesn't pass through any lattice points for x from 1 to 50.But let me check another fraction. For example, 16/47 ≈ 0.3404, which is just above 1/3. Is 16/47 in simplest terms? 16 and 47 have no common factors, so yes. So, 16/47 is another candidate.Wait, 16/47 ≈ 0.3404, which is slightly larger than 18/53 ≈ 0.3396. So, 16/47 is actually larger than 18/53. Therefore, if I set a = 16/47, then m can go up to just below 16/47, which is higher than 18/53. But does 16/47 cause any issues?For m = 16/47, let's see if y = (16/47)x + 3 is an integer for any x from 1 to 50. For y to be integer, (16/47)x must be integer, so 47 must divide x. But x is up to 50, so x = 47 would make y = 16 + 3 = 19, which is an integer. Therefore, m = 16/47 would cause the line to pass through (47, 19), which is a lattice point. Therefore, a cannot be as high as 16/47 because m = 16/47 would cause a lattice point at x = 47.Therefore, 16/47 is too high because it would intersect a lattice point at x = 47. So, the maximum a must be less than 16/47.Wait, but 18/53 is approximately 0.3396, which is less than 16/47 ≈ 0.3404. So, 18/53 is less than 16/47. Therefore, if we set a = 18/53, then m would be less than 18/53, which is less than 16/47, so m wouldn't reach 16/47, and thus, the line wouldn't pass through (47, 19).But wait, is there a fraction between 1/3 and 18/53 with a denominator less than or equal to 50 that would cause y to be integer? For example, let's check q = 50. What's the smallest p such that p/50 > 1/3?p > 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so p = 17. Therefore, 17/50 = 0.34, which is just above 1/3. Is 17/50 in simplest terms? 17 and 50 have no common factors, so yes. So, 17/50 ≈ 0.34.Now, if m = 17/50, then for x = 50, y = (17/50)*50 + 3 = 17 + 3 = 20, which is an integer. Therefore, m = 17/50 would cause the line to pass through (50, 20), which is a lattice point. Therefore, a cannot be as high as 17/50 because m = 17/50 would intersect a lattice point at x = 50.But 17/50 is approximately 0.34, which is greater than 18/53 ≈ 0.3396. So, if we set a = 18/53, then m would be less than 18/53, which is less than 17/50, so m wouldn't reach 17/50, and thus, the line wouldn't pass through (50, 20).Wait, but 18/53 is approximately 0.3396, which is very close to 17/50 ≈ 0.34. So, is there a fraction between 18/53 and 17/50 with a denominator less than or equal to 50 that would cause y to be integer?Let me check q = 51. The smallest p such that p/51 > 1/3 is p = 17, because 17/51 = 1/3. So, the next fraction is 18/51 = 6/17 ≈ 0.3529, which we already discussed.Wait, but 18/51 is 6/17, which is greater than 17/50. So, between 1/3 and 18/53, the next fraction with denominator greater than 50 is 18/53 itself.Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list the fractions just above 1/3 with denominators greater than 50.- 18/53 ≈ 0.3396- 19/57 ≈ 0.3333 (but 57 > 50, but 19/57 simplifies to 1/3, so it's not greater)- 20/60 = 1/3, same issue- 17/51 = 1/3- 18/51 = 6/17 ≈ 0.3529- 19/54 ≈ 0.3519- 20/57 ≈ 0.3509- 21/60 = 7/20 = 0.35Wait, but all these fractions either simplify to 1/3 or have denominators less than 50 when reduced. So, the next fraction after 1/3 with denominator greater than 50 is 18/53.Therefore, the maximum value of 'a' is 18/53 because beyond that, the next possible m would be 18/53, which is the first fraction after 1/3 with a denominator greater than 50 that doesn't cause y to be integer for x from 1 to 50.Wait, but earlier I thought that 16/47 is another candidate, but it's actually higher than 18/53 and causes a lattice point at x = 47. So, 16/47 is too high.Similarly, 17/51 is exactly 1/3, so it's the lower bound. 18/51 is 6/17, which is higher than 18/53 and causes a lattice point at x = 17.Therefore, the correct answer should be D) 18/53."},{"question":"Evaluate the integral int_{0}^{1} x^2 , dx.","answer":"Okay, so I have this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to 1 of x squared dx. Hmm, I remember that integrals are about finding the area under a curve, right? So, in this case, I need to find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x² between x = 0 and x = 1.First, I think I need to recall how to compute definite integrals. I remember that for polynomials, it's pretty straightforward. You find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the upper and lower limits of integration.So, what's the antiderivative of x squared? I think the general rule is that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), as long as n isn't -1. In this case, n is 2, so applying the rule, the antiderivative should be (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x³/3.Okay, so now I have the antiderivative, which is x³/3. The next step is to evaluate this from 0 to 1. That means I plug in the upper limit, which is 1, into the antiderivative and then subtract the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit, which is 0.Let's do that. Plugging in 1: (1)³/3 = 1/3. Plugging in 0: (0)³/3 = 0. So, subtracting these, I get 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.Wait, that seems too simple. Did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The function x² is continuous on the interval [0,1], so the integral should exist. Also, the antiderivative I found seems correct. Yeah, I think that's right.Just to make sure, maybe I can visualize the area under the curve. From x = 0 to x = 1, the graph of x² starts at (0,0) and goes up to (1,1). The area under this curve should be a smooth shape, and the integral gives the exact area, which we calculated as 1/3.Alternatively, I could approximate the integral using Riemann sums to see if it approaches 1/3. For example, if I divide the interval [0,1] into n equal parts, each of width 1/n. Then, the Riemann sum would be the sum from i=1 to n of (i/n)² * (1/n). That simplifies to (1/n³) times the sum of i² from i=1 to n.I remember that the sum of squares formula is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. So plugging that in, the Riemann sum becomes (1/n³) * n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = (n+1)(2n+1)/(6n²).As n approaches infinity, the terms (n+1)/n² approach 1/n, which goes to 0, and (2n+1)/n² approaches 2/n, which also goes to 0. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying.Let me try again. The Riemann sum is (1/n³) * [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6]. Let's expand that numerator:n(n+1)(2n+1) = n*(n+1)*(2n+1) = n*(2n² + 3n + 1) = 2n³ + 3n² + n.So, the Riemann sum becomes (2n³ + 3n² + n)/(6n³) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6.As n approaches infinity, the terms 3/n and 1/n² go to zero, leaving us with 2/6 = 1/3. Okay, that matches our earlier result. So, the Riemann sum approach also gives us 1/3, confirming that our integral calculation is correct.Another way to think about it is using geometry. The area under x² from 0 to 1 is a region bounded by the curve, the x-axis, and the lines x=0 and x=1. Since x² is a parabola opening upwards, the area should be less than the area of the square it's inscribed in, which is 1. And 1/3 is indeed less than 1, so that makes sense.I could also use the fundamental theorem of calculus, which connects differentiation and integration. It states that if F is an antiderivative of f, then the definite integral from a to b of f(x) dx is F(b) - F(a). In this case, F(x) = x³/3, so F(1) - F(0) = 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.Just to explore further, what if I changed the limits of integration? For example, if I integrated from 0 to 2, the antiderivative would still be x³/3, and evaluating at 2 would give 8/3, minus 0, so 8/3. That seems logical since the area would be larger.But in our original problem, the limits are from 0 to 1, so the result is 1/3. I think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem and each time I get the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.One last check: differentiation. If I take the derivative of x³/3, I should get back x². The derivative of x³/3 is (3x²)/3 = x², which matches the original function. So, that confirms that my antiderivative was correct.Alright, I think I've thought this through thoroughly. The integral from 0 to 1 of x squared dx is indeed 1/3."},{"question":"two employees x and y are paid a total of rs . 800 per week by their employer . if x is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to y , how much is y paid per week ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the weekly payment for employee Y.

They're all different digits, and when I add up the three numbers, I get 479. The problem looks like this:\`\`\`  J K L  J L L+ J K L-------  4 7 9\`\`\`Okay, let's break this down step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to look at each column separately, starting from the rightmost digit (the units place) and moving to the left. That usually helps with these kinds of addition puzzles.**Units Column:**First, let's look at the units column. We have L + L + L, which is 3L. The result in the units place of the sum is 9. So, 3L must equal 9 or 19 because if there's a carryover from the tens column, it could add 10 to the units place. But since 3L can't be more than 27 (because L is a single digit), the only possibility is 3L = 9. So, L must be 3.**Tens Column:**Now, moving to the tens column. We have K + L + K, which simplifies to 2K + L. We already know that L is 3, so this becomes 2K + 3. The result in the tens place of the sum is 7. So, 2K + 3 must equal 7 or 17 (again, considering a possible carryover from the hundreds column). But 2K + 3 = 17 would mean K is 7, which seems too high because 2*7 + 3 = 17, but let's check if that's possible.If K were 7, then 2*7 + 3 = 17, which would mean we have a carryover of 1 to the hundreds column. But let's see if that works with the hundreds column.**Hundreds Column:**In the hundreds column, we have J + J + J, which is 3J. If there's a carryover from the tens column, it would add 1 to this sum. The result in the hundreds place of the sum is 4. So, 3J + 1 must equal 4. That would mean 3J = 3, so J = 1.But wait, if J is 1, then let's check if that works with the tens column. If K is 7, then 2*7 + 3 = 17, which would mean we have a 7 in the tens place and a carryover of 1 to the hundreds column. But in the hundreds column, we have 3*1 + 1 = 4, which matches the given sum. So, that seems to work.But hold on, earlier I thought L was 3, K was 7, and J was 1. Let's check if all digits are different. Yes, 1, 3, and 7 are all different. So, that seems to fit.But wait, let's double-check the addition:\`\`\`  1 7 3  1 3 3+ 1 7 3-------  4 7 9\`\`\`Adding the units column: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. Good.Adding the tens column: 7 + 3 + 7 = 17. We write down 7 and carry over 1.Adding the hundreds column: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 4. Perfect.So, it seems like J = 1, K = 7, and L = 3. Therefore, J + K + L = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11.But wait, the options given are A) 6, B) 8, C) 9, D) 10, E) 11. So, 11 is an option, E.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere because the initial assumption was that 3L = 9, so L = 3. But what if there's a carryover from the tens column to the units column? That would mean 3L could be 9 or 19. If 3L = 19, then L would be approximately 6.333, which isn't a whole number, so that's not possible. So, L must be 3.Then, moving to the tens column: 2K + 3 = 7 or 17. If 2K + 3 = 7, then 2K = 4, so K = 2. If 2K + 3 = 17, then 2K = 14, so K = 7. We already saw that K = 7 works, but let's check K = 2.If K = 2, then in the tens column: 2*2 + 3 = 7, which matches the tens place. So, no carryover from the tens column. Then, in the hundreds column: 3J = 4. But 3J = 4 doesn't make sense because J would have to be 4/3, which isn't a whole number. So, K can't be 2. Therefore, K must be 7, and there is a carryover of 1 to the hundreds column.So, J = 1, K = 7, L = 3, and J + K + L = 11.Wait, but the options include 11, so that must be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I initially thought L was 3, but let me make sure.Let me try plugging in J = 1, K = 7, L = 3 into the original problem:\`\`\`  1 7 3  1 3 3+ 1 7 3-------  4 7 9\`\`\`Adding the units: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.Adding the tens: 7 + 3 + 7 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.Adding the hundreds: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 4.Yes, that works perfectly. So, J = 1, K = 7, L = 3, and their sum is 11.But wait, the options are A) 6, B) 8, C) 9, D) 10, E) 11. So, 11 is an option, E.But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes these puzzles can have multiple solutions, but in this case, it seems like this is the only solution where all digits are different and the addition works out.So, I think the answer is E) 11."},{"question":"Let r be the speed in miles per hour at which a wheel, 15 feet in circumference, travels. If the time for a complete rotation of the wheel is shortened by frac{1}{4} of a second, the speed r increases by 6 miles per hour. What is r?A) 11B) 12C) 12.5D) 13","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a wheel with a circumference of 15 feet, and it's traveling at a speed of r miles per hour. The problem says that if the time for a complete rotation of the wheel is shortened by 1/4 of a second, then the speed r increases by 6 miles per hour. I need to find what r is.Okay, let's break this down. First, I know that the circumference of the wheel is 15 feet. That means every time the wheel makes one full rotation, it covers 15 feet of distance. So, if I can figure out how long it takes to make one rotation, I can relate that to the speed.Speed is distance over time, right? So, if the wheel is moving at r miles per hour, I can find out how much time it takes to travel 15 feet. But wait, the units are different: the circumference is in feet, and the speed is in miles per hour. I need to convert them to the same units.Let me convert 15 feet to miles. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 15 feet is 15/5280 miles. That simplifies to 5/1760 miles, which is approximately 0.00284 miles. Okay, so each rotation covers about 0.00284 miles.Now, if the speed is r miles per hour, then the time it takes to travel 0.00284 miles is distance divided by speed. So, time t is equal to 0.00284 divided by r. But wait, r is in miles per hour, and I need the time in hours. So, t = (15/5280)/r hours.But the problem mentions the time being shortened by 1/4 of a second. So, I need to convert this time into seconds to make the units consistent. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so t in seconds is (15/5280)/r * 3600.Let me write that down:t = (15/5280) / r * 3600Simplify that:t = (15 * 3600) / (5280 * r)Calculate 15 * 3600: that's 54,000.And 5280 * r is just 5280r.So, t = 54,000 / 5280rSimplify 54,000 / 5280: divide numerator and denominator by 10, get 5400 / 528.Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 5400 ÷ 12 = 450, 528 ÷ 12 = 44.So, t = 450 / 44rWhich simplifies to t ≈ 10.227 / r seconds.Okay, so the time for one rotation is approximately 10.227 divided by r seconds.Now, the problem says that if this time is shortened by 1/4 of a second, the speed increases by 6 mph. So, the new time is t - 1/4, and the new speed is r + 6.So, using the same formula, the new time is:t' = (15/5280) / (r + 6) * 3600Which, following the same steps as before, simplifies to:t' = 54,000 / (5280(r + 6)) = 450 / (44(r + 6)) ≈ 10.227 / (r + 6) seconds.But we also know that t' = t - 1/4. So, we can set up the equation:10.227 / (r + 6) = 10.227 / r - 1/4Hmm, that seems a bit messy with the decimals. Maybe I should keep it in fractions to be more precise.Going back, t = 450 / (44r) and t' = 450 / (44(r + 6)). So, t' = t - 1/4.Therefore:450 / (44(r + 6)) = 450 / (44r) - 1/4Let me write that equation:450 / (44(r + 6)) = 450 / (44r) - 1/4To solve for r, I can first eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by 44r(r + 6). That should get rid of the fractions.Multiplying each term:450r = 450(r + 6) - (1/4)(44r(r + 6))Simplify each term:Left side: 450rRight side: 450r + 2700 - (11r(r + 6))So, expanding the right side:450r + 2700 - 11r^2 - 66rCombine like terms:450r - 66r = 384rSo, right side becomes: 384r + 2700 - 11r^2Now, set the equation:450r = 384r + 2700 - 11r^2Bring all terms to one side:450r - 384r - 2700 + 11r^2 = 0Simplify:66r - 2700 + 11r^2 = 0Rearrange:11r^2 + 66r - 2700 = 0Divide the entire equation by 11 to simplify:r^2 + 6r - 245.4545 ≈ 0Wait, that decimal is a bit messy. Maybe I should have kept it as fractions earlier.Let me go back to the equation before multiplying:450 / (44(r + 6)) = 450 / (44r) - 1/4Let me express 450/44 as a fraction. 450 divided by 44 is 225/22.So, t = 225/(22r) and t' = 225/(22(r + 6)).So, the equation becomes:225/(22(r + 6)) = 225/(22r) - 1/4Now, let's multiply both sides by 22 to eliminate denominators:225/(r + 6) = 225/r - 22/4Simplify 22/4 to 11/2:225/(r + 6) = 225/r - 11/2Now, let's move all terms to one side:225/(r + 6) - 225/r + 11/2 = 0Combine the fractions:225(r) - 225(r + 6) / [r(r + 6)] + 11/2 = 0Simplify numerator:225r - 225r - 1350 = -1350So, we have:-1350 / [r(r + 6)] + 11/2 = 0Move the fraction to the other side:11/2 = 1350 / [r(r + 6)]Multiply both sides by [r(r + 6)]:(11/2) r(r + 6) = 1350Multiply both sides by 2:11 r(r + 6) = 2700Expand the left side:11r^2 + 66r = 2700Bring all terms to one side:11r^2 + 66r - 2700 = 0Divide the entire equation by 11:r^2 + 6r - 245.4545 ≈ 0Hmm, still messy.

So, 13 is an option, D.But wait, let me check if r = 12 works.If r = 12, then t = 450 / (44*12) = 450 / 528 ≈ 0.8523 seconds per rotation.Shortening by 1/4 second would make it 0.8523 - 0.25 ≈ 0.6023 seconds.Then, new speed would be 450 / (44*0.6023) ≈ 450 / 26.5 ≈ 16.98 mph, which is approximately 17, which is 5 more than 12, not 6. So, that doesn't fit.Wait, maybe I need to check r = 12.Wait, let's calculate t when r = 12:t = (15/5280)/12 * 360015/5280 = 0.00284 miles0.00284 / 12 = 0.0002367 hoursConvert to seconds: 0.0002367 * 3600 ≈ 0.852 secondsShorten by 1/4 second: 0.852 - 0.25 = 0.602 secondsNew speed: (15/5280) / (0.602/3600)Convert 0.602 seconds to hours: 0.602 / 3600 ≈ 0.0001672 hoursSo, speed = (15/5280) / 0.0001672 ≈ 0.00284 / 0.0001672 ≈ 16.98 mphWhich is an increase of about 4.98 mph, not 6. So, r =12 doesn't give exactly 6 mph increase.Wait, but maybe my approximations are off.

First, I'll look at (2sqrt{18}). I know that 18 can be broken down into 9 and 2 because 9 times 2 is 18, and 9 is a perfect square. So, (sqrt{18}) should be (sqrt{9 times 2}), which is (sqrt{9} times sqrt{2}). Since (sqrt{9}) is 3, that becomes (3sqrt{2}). So, (2sqrt{18}) is (2 times 3sqrt{2}), which is (6sqrt{2}). Okay, that part seems manageable.Next, I have (-3sqrt{2}). That one is straightforward; it's just negative three times the square root of two. I don't think I need to simplify that further.Then, there's (-sqrt{frac{1}{2}}). Hmm, square roots of fractions can be a bit confusing. I think I can rewrite (sqrt{frac{1}{2}}) as (frac{sqrt{1}}{sqrt{2}}), which simplifies to (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}). But usually, we don't like having square roots in the denominator, so I might need to rationalize that. To rationalize (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by (sqrt{2}), which gives me (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). So, (-sqrt{frac{1}{2}}) becomes (-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).Now, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to:(6sqrt{2} - 3sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).Looking at these terms, they all have (sqrt{2}) in them, so I can combine them like terms. Let's see:First, (6sqrt{2} - 3sqrt{2}) is (3sqrt{2}). Then, subtracting (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) from that. So, (3sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).To subtract these, I need a common denominator. The first term is (3sqrt{2}), which can be written as (frac{6sqrt{2}}{2}) to have the same denominator as (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). So, (frac{6sqrt{2}}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) equals (frac{5sqrt{2}}{2}).Alright, so the first problem simplifies to (frac{5sqrt{2}}{2}). That seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning, simplifying each radical, combining like terms, and rationalizing the denominator—all seem correct. Okay, I think that's solid.Moving on to the second problem: ((sqrt{3} - 1)^2 - (sqrt{2} + sqrt{3})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{2})). This looks a bit more complex because it involves expanding squared terms and multiplying binomials. Let's tackle each part step by step.First, let's expand ((sqrt{3} - 1)^2). I remember that ((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2), so applying that here:((sqrt{3})^2 - 2 times sqrt{3} times 1 + 1^2).Calculating each term:- ((sqrt{3})^2) is 3.- (2 times sqrt{3} times 1) is (2sqrt{3}).- (1^2) is 1.So, putting it all together: (3 - 2sqrt{3} + 1), which simplifies to (4 - 2sqrt{3}).Next, I need to expand ((sqrt{2} + sqrt{3})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{2})). This looks like a difference of squares setup because it's in the form ((a + b)(a - b)), which equals (a^2 - b^2). Here, (a) is (sqrt{3}) and (b) is (sqrt{2}).So, applying the difference of squares formula:((sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{2})^2).Calculating each term:- ((sqrt{3})^2) is 3.- ((sqrt{2})^2) is 2.So, this simplifies to (3 - 2 = 1).Now, putting it all back into the original expression:((sqrt{3} - 1)^2 - (sqrt{2} + sqrt{3})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{2}) = (4 - 2sqrt{3}) - 1).Subtracting 1 from 4 gives me 3, so the entire expression simplifies to (3 - 2sqrt{3}).Let me verify my steps again to ensure accuracy. Expanding the square correctly, applying the difference of squares, simplifying each term—everything seems to check out. I think that's the right answer.So, summarizing both problems:1. (2sqrt{18} - 3sqrt{2} - sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{5sqrt{2}}{2})2. ((sqrt{3} - 1)^2 - (sqrt{2} + sqrt{3})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{2}) = 3 - 2sqrt{3})I feel confident about these solutions after going through each step carefully."},{"question":"Calculate the sum ( 1+2+3+dots+55 ) and then multiply the result by 4.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 55.

This will help eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator.After simplifying, I'll find the complex conjugate of ( z ), denoted as ( overline{z} ).

What are the lengths of the sides of the triangle?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a right triangle. The perimeter is 60 cm, and the height corresponding to the hypotenuse is 12 cm. I need to find the lengths of the sides. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's recall what a right triangle is. It's a triangle with one angle measuring 90 degrees, and the sides are related by the Pythagorean theorem. So, if I call the two legs 'a' and 'b', and the hypotenuse 'c', then I know that (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). That's one equation I can use.Next, the perimeter is given as 60 cm. Perimeter is just the sum of all sides, so that gives me another equation: (a + b + c = 60). Okay, so now I have two equations:1. (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)2. (a + b + c = 60)But there's also the height corresponding to the hypotenuse, which is 12 cm. I need to figure out how to use this information. I remember that in a right triangle, the area can be expressed in two ways: one using the legs as base and height, and another using the hypotenuse and the corresponding height.So, the area using the legs is (frac{1}{2}ab), and the area using the hypotenuse and height is (frac{1}{2} times c times 12). Since both expressions represent the area of the same triangle, I can set them equal to each other:[frac{1}{2}ab = frac{1}{2} times c times 12]Simplifying this, I get:[ab = 12c]Alright, so now I have three equations:1. (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)2. (a + b + c = 60)3. (ab = 12c)Now, I need to solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's see how to approach this.From equation 2, I can express 'c' in terms of 'a' and 'b':[c = 60 - a - b]Now, I can substitute this expression for 'c' into equations 1 and 3.Starting with equation 3:[ab = 12c = 12(60 - a - b) = 720 - 12a - 12b]So, rearranging:[ab + 12a + 12b = 720]Hmm, that's one equation. Let's see if I can factor this or make it more manageable. Maybe I can add 144 to both sides to complete the square or something. Wait, let's see:[ab + 12a + 12b + 144 = 720 + 144 = 864]So, factoring the left side:[(a + 12)(b + 12) = 864]Interesting, that might be useful later. Let's hold onto that.Now, let's substitute 'c' into equation 1:[a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = (60 - a - b)^2]Expanding the right side:[(60 - a - b)^2 = 60^2 - 2 times 60 times (a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 3600 - 120(a + b) + a^2 + 2ab + b^2]So, equation 1 becomes:[a^2 + b^2 = 3600 - 120(a + b) + a^2 + 2ab + b^2]Subtracting (a^2 + b^2) from both sides:[0 = 3600 - 120(a + b) + 2ab]Simplify:[2ab - 120a - 120b + 3600 = 0]Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:[ab - 60a - 60b + 1800 = 0]Hmm, this looks similar to the equation I had earlier. Let me recall that from equation 3 substitution:[ab + 12a + 12b = 720]Wait, so now I have two equations involving 'ab', 'a', and 'b':1. (ab - 60a - 60b + 1800 = 0)2. (ab + 12a + 12b = 720)Maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate 'ab'. Let's try that.Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:[(ab - 60a - 60b + 1800) - (ab + 12a + 12b) = 0 - 720]Simplify:[ab - 60a - 60b + 1800 - ab - 12a - 12b = -720]Combine like terms:[(-60a - 12a) + (-60b - 12b) + 1800 = -720][-72a - 72b + 1800 = -720]Factor out -72:[-72(a + b) + 1800 = -720]Subtract 1800 from both sides:[-72(a + b) = -720 - 1800 = -2520]Divide both sides by -72:[a + b = frac{-2520}{-72} = 35]Okay, so (a + b = 35). Now, from equation 2, (a + b + c = 60), so:[35 + c = 60 implies c = 25]Wait, hold on. That doesn't make sense because earlier, when I set (c = 60 - a - b), and now (a + b = 35), so (c = 25). But earlier, when I used the area, I had (ab = 12c), so (ab = 12 times 25 = 300).But earlier, I had another equation: (ab + 12a + 12b = 720). If (ab = 300), then:[300 + 12a + 12b = 720 implies 12a + 12b = 420 implies a + b = 35]Which is consistent with what I found. So, that's good.Now, I have (a + b = 35) and (ab = 300). So, I can set up a quadratic equation where 'a' and 'b' are roots.Let me let (x = a) and (y = b). Then:[x + y = 35][xy = 300]So, the quadratic equation is:[t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0 implies t^2 - 35t + 300 = 0]Now, let's solve this quadratic equation. The discriminant (D = 35^2 - 4 times 1 times 300 = 1225 - 1200 = 25).So, the roots are:[t = frac{35 pm sqrt{25}}{2} = frac{35 pm 5}{2}]Which gives:[t = frac{35 + 5}{2} = 20 quad text{and} quad t = frac{35 - 5}{2} = 15]So, the two legs are 15 cm and 20 cm, and the hypotenuse is 25 cm.Wait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify if this satisfies all the original conditions.First, the perimeter: 15 + 20 + 25 = 60 cm. That's correct.Next, the Pythagorean theorem: (15^2 + 20^2 = 225 + 400 = 625 = 25^2). That's correct.Lastly, the area: Using the legs, it's (frac{1}{2} times 15 times 20 = 150) cm². Using the hypotenuse and height, it's (frac{1}{2} times 25 times 12 = 150) cm². That's also correct.Hmm, so everything checks out. So, the sides are 15 cm, 20 cm, and 25 cm.Wait, but in my earlier steps, I thought I had a different value for 'c'. Let me double-check.Initially, I thought (c = 35), but that led to inconsistencies. But when I correctly solved the equations, I found (c = 25). So, that was a mistake in my initial assumption, but correcting it led to the right answer.So, to summarize, the sides of the triangle are 15 cm, 20 cm, and 25 cm."},{"question":"Prove thatf_{c}=sqrt{a b-c_{1} c_{2}}where ( f_{c} ) is the length of the internal angle bisector from vertex ( C ) of triangle ( triangle ABC ), ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the sides opposite vertices ( A ) and ( B ) respectively, and ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ) are the segments created on side ( c ) intersected by ( f_{c} ).

The formula given is ( f_{c} = sqrt{a b - c_{1} c_{2}} ), where ( f_{c} ) is the length of the angle bisector from vertex ( C ), ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the sides opposite vertices ( A ) and ( B ), and ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ) are the segments created on side ( c ) by the bisector.First, I need to understand what an internal angle bisector is. It's a line that splits the angle at vertex ( C ) into two equal angles. This bisector intersects the opposite side ( c ), dividing it into two segments, ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ). The formula relates these segments and the sides ( a ) and ( b ) to the length of the bisector.To prove the formula, I think I'll need to use some trigonometric identities and maybe the Law of Cosines. Let me recall that the Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), and angle ( gamma ) opposite side ( c ), the following holds: ( c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2ab cos gamma ).Since the angle bisector divides angle ( gamma ) into two equal parts, each of measure ( gamma/2 ). Maybe I can apply the Law of Cosines to the two smaller triangles formed by the bisector. Let's denote the length of the bisector as ( f_{c} ). Then, in triangle ( ACD ) (where ( D ) is the point where the bisector intersects side ( c )), the sides are ( a ), ( f_{c} ), and ( c_{1} ), with the angle between ( a ) and ( f_{c} ) being ( gamma/2 ). Similarly, in triangle ( BCD ), the sides are ( b ), ( f_{c} ), and ( c_{2} ), with the angle between ( b ) and ( f_{c} ) being ( gamma/2 ).Applying the Law of Cosines to both triangles:For triangle ( ACD ):[ c_{1}^{2} = a^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - 2 a f_{c} cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) ]For triangle ( BCD ):[ c_{2}^{2} = b^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - 2 b f_{c} cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) ]Now, I have two equations involving ( f_{c} ) and ( cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) ). Maybe I can solve both equations for ( cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) ) and set them equal to each other.From the first equation:[ cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) = frac{a^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{1}^{2}}{2 a f_{c}} ]From the second equation:[ cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) = frac{b^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{2}^{2}}{2 b f_{c}} ]Since both expressions equal ( cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right) ), I can set them equal to each other:[ frac{a^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{1}^{2}}{2 a f_{c}} = frac{b^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{2}^{2}}{2 b f_{c}} ]Multiplying both sides by ( 2 a b f_{c} ) to eliminate denominators:[ b(a^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{1}^{2}) = a(b^{2} + f_{c}^{2} - c_{2}^{2}) ]Expanding both sides:[ a^{2} b + b f_{c}^{2} - b c_{1}^{2} = a b^{2} + a f_{c}^{2} - a c_{2}^{2} ]Rearranging terms to isolate ( f_{c}^{2} ):[ b f_{c}^{2} - a f_{c}^{2} = a b^{2} - a^{2} b - a c_{2}^{2} + b c_{1}^{2} ]Factor out ( f_{c}^{2} ) on the left:[ f_{c}^{2} (b - a) = a b (b - a) + ( - a c_{2}^{2} + b c_{1}^{2}) ]Assuming ( a neq b ), we can divide both sides by ( (b - a) ):[ f_{c}^{2} = a b + frac{ - a c_{2}^{2} + b c_{1}^{2} }{ (b - a) } ]This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach. I recall that the angle bisector theorem states that ( frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}} = frac{a}{b} ). So, ( c_{1} = frac{a}{b} c_{2} ). Also, since ( c_{1} + c_{2} = c ), we can express ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ) in terms of ( c ).Let me denote ( c_{1} = frac{a}{a + b} c ) and ( c_{2} = frac{b}{a + b} c ). This comes from the angle bisector theorem, which divides side ( c ) proportionally to the adjacent sides ( a ) and ( b ).Now, substituting ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ) back into the equation for ( f_{c}^{2} ):[ f_{c}^{2} = a b - c_{1} c_{2} ][ f_{c}^{2} = a b - left( frac{a}{a + b} c right) left( frac{b}{a + b} c right) ][ f_{c}^{2} = a b - frac{a b c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} ]But I also know from the Law of Cosines that:[ c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma ]Substituting ( c^{2} ) into the equation for ( f_{c}^{2} ):[ f_{c}^{2} = a b - frac{a b (a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} ]This seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to relate ( c_{1} ) and ( c_{2} ) directly without involving ( c ).Wait, going back to the earlier step:[ f_{c}^{2} = a b - c_{1} c_{2} ]If I can express ( c_{1} c_{2} ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ), then I can directly find ( f_{c} ).From the angle bisector theorem, ( c_{1} = frac{a}{a + b} c ) and ( c_{2} = frac{b}{a + b} c ). Therefore:[ c_{1} c_{2} = frac{a b c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} ]So,[ f_{c}^{2} = a b - frac{a b c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = a b left( 1 - frac{c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ f_{c}^{2} = a b left( frac{(a + b)^{2} - c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{a b left( (a + b)^{2} - c^{2} right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ]But this still involves ( c ), which we can express using the Law of Cosines:[ c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma ]Substituting back:[ f_{c}^{2} = frac{a b left( (a + b)^{2} - (a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma) right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{a b left( a^{2} + 2 a b + b^{2} - a^{2} - b^{2} + 2 a b cos gamma right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{a b left( 2 a b + 2 a b cos gamma right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{2 a^{2} b^{2} (1 + cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{2 a^{2} b^{2} cdot 2 cos^{2} left( frac{gamma}{2} right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c}^{2} = frac{4 a^{2} b^{2} cos^{2} left( frac{gamma}{2} right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ f_{c} = frac{2 a b cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right)}{a + b} ]Hmm, this seems like a different expression for ( f_{c} ). But I was supposed to prove that ( f_{c} = sqrt{a b - c_{1} c_{2}} ). Maybe I need to reconcile these two expressions.From the angle bisector theorem, we have:[ c_{1} = frac{a}{a + b} c ][ c_{2} = frac{b}{a + b} c ][ c_{1} c_{2} = frac{a b c^{2}}{(a + b)^{2}} ]From the Law of Cosines:[ c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma ]Substituting back into ( c_{1} c_{2} ):[ c_{1} c_{2} = frac{a b (a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} ]Now, let's compute ( a b - c_{1} c_{2} ):[ a b - c_{1} c_{2} = a b - frac{a b (a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ = a b left( 1 - frac{a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ = a b left( frac{(a + b)^{2} - (a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ = a b left( frac{a^{2} + 2 a b + b^{2} - a^{2} - b^{2} + 2 a b cos gamma}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ = a b left( frac{2 a b + 2 a b cos gamma}{(a + b)^{2}} right) ][ = frac{2 a^{2} b^{2} (1 + cos gamma)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ = frac{4 a^{2} b^{2} cos^{2} left( frac{gamma}{2} right)}{(a + b)^{2}} ][ = left( frac{2 a b cos left( frac{gamma}{2} right)}{a + b} right)^{2} ]Therefore,[ f_{c} = sqrt{a b - c_{1} c_{2}} ]So, the formula is proven.Now, applying this to the given values:- ( a = 18 , text{cm} )- ( b = 9 , text{cm} )- ( gamma = 120^circ )First, find side ( c ) using the Law of Cosines:[ c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b cos gamma ][ c^{2} = 18^{2} + 9^{2} - 2 cdot 18 cdot 9 cdot cos 120^circ ][ cos 120^circ = -frac{1}{2} ][ c^{2} = 324 + 81 - 2 cdot 18 cdot 9 cdot (-frac{1}{2}) ][ c^{2} = 405 + 162 ][ c^{2} = 567 ][ c = sqrt{567} = 3 sqrt{63} = 3 cdot 3 sqrt{7} = 9 sqrt{7} , text{cm} ]Now, using the angle bisector theorem:[ frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}} = frac{a}{b} = frac{18}{9} = 2 ]So,[ c_{1} = 2 c_{2} ]And,[ c_{1} + c_{2} = c = 9 sqrt{7} ][ 2 c_{2} + c_{2} = 9 sqrt{7} ][ 3 c_{2} = 9 sqrt{7} ][ c_{2} = 3 sqrt{7} , text{cm} ][ c_{1} = 6 sqrt{7} , text{cm} ]Now, compute ( f_{c} ):[ f_{c} = sqrt{a b - c_{1} c_{2}} ][ f_{c} = sqrt{18 cdot 9 - 6 sqrt{7} cdot 3 sqrt{7}} ][ f_{c} = sqrt{162 - 18 cdot 7} ][ f_{c} = sqrt{162 - 126} ][ f_{c} = sqrt{36} ][ f_{c} = 6 , text{cm} ]So, the length of the internal angle bisector ( f_{c} ) is 6 centimeters."},{"question":"A regular tetrahedron is formed by joining four vertices of a cube such that each vertex belongs to a different face. What is the ratio of the volume of the tetrahedron to the volume of the cube?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular tetrahedron formed by joining four vertices of a cube, with each vertex on a different face. I need to find the ratio of the volume of this tetrahedron to the volume of the cube. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, and every face is congruent. So, in this case, the tetrahedron is formed by four vertices of a cube, each on a different face. That means each vertex of the tetrahedron is on a separate face of the cube.Now, let's consider a cube. A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. If I'm selecting four vertices, each on a different face, I need to figure out how these vertices are positioned relative to each other. Maybe it would help to visualize or sketch a cube and label the vertices.Let's assume the cube has side length 'a'. The volume of the cube would then be ( a^3 ). I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron formed by these four vertices and then find the ratio.To find the volume of the tetrahedron, I need to know the edge length of the tetrahedron. Since it's a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal. So, I need to determine the distance between any two of these four vertices on the cube.Let me assign coordinates to the cube to make this easier. Let's place the cube in a 3D coordinate system with one corner at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the opposite corner would be at (a,a,a). The four vertices of the tetrahedron would be at positions where each coordinate is either 0 or a, but each vertex is on a different face.Wait, actually, if each vertex is on a different face, then each vertex must have exactly one coordinate equal to 0 or a, and the other two coordinates somewhere in between? Or maybe not necessarily at the corners? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.Let me clarify: each face of the cube is a square, and each vertex of the tetrahedron lies on a different face. So, each vertex is on a different face, but not necessarily at the corners. So, each vertex could be somewhere along an edge or a face diagonal.But wait, if I'm forming a regular tetrahedron, all edges must be equal. That means the distances between any two vertices must be the same. So, if I choose four points on the cube, each on a different face, such that the distance between any two points is the same, then that should form a regular tetrahedron.Let me think about how to choose such points. Maybe if I take the centers of four different faces? But the centers of the faces are all equidistant from the center of the cube, but the distances between the centers would vary depending on which faces they're on.Wait, no. If I take the centers of four faces that are all adjacent to a single vertex, then the distances between those centers might not be equal. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.Alternatively, perhaps the four vertices of the tetrahedron are at the midpoints of four edges of the cube, each on a different face. Let me check that.If I take the midpoint of an edge on the front face, the midpoint of an edge on the right face, the midpoint of an edge on the top face, and the midpoint of an edge on the back face, would those form a regular tetrahedron? I'm not sure. Let me calculate the distances.Assuming the cube has side length 'a', the coordinates of the midpoints would be (a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (0, 0, a/2), and (a, a, a/2). Wait, no, that last one is not a midpoint. Maybe I should choose midpoints on different edges.Actually, let me assign specific coordinates. Let's say the cube has vertices from (0,0,0) to (a,a,a). Then, the midpoints of the edges would be at (a/2,0,0), (0,a/2,0), (0,0,a/2), (a,a/2,0), (a/2,a,0), (a,0,a/2), (0,a,a/2), and (a/2,0,a). So, if I choose four midpoints, each on a different face, such that they form a regular tetrahedron.Wait, maybe choosing (a/2,0,0), (0,a/2,0), (0,0,a/2), and (a/2,a/2,a/2). Hmm, but (a/2,a/2,a/2) is the center of the cube, not a midpoint of an edge. So that might not work.Alternatively, maybe choosing four vertices that are diagonally opposite on each face. For example, on the front face, take (0,0,0), on the right face take (a,a,0), on the back face take (a,a,a), and on the top face take (0,a,a). Wait, but these are all corners of the cube, not midpoints.But if I connect these four corners, would that form a regular tetrahedron? Let me check the distances. The distance between (0,0,0) and (a,a,0) is ( sqrt{(a)^2 + (a)^2 + 0} = asqrt{2} ). The distance between (a,a,0) and (a,a,a) is ( sqrt{0 + 0 + (a)^2} = a ). Hmm, so the edges are not equal. That doesn't form a regular tetrahedron.So, maybe choosing four corners isn't the way to go. Perhaps I need to choose points that are not at the corners but somewhere along the edges or faces.Wait, another idea: if I take the four space diagonals of the cube, each connecting opposite corners through the center. But a cube has four space diagonals, each connecting (0,0,0) to (a,a,a), (0,a,0) to (a,0,a), etc. If I take the midpoints of these space diagonals, which would all be at (a/2, a/2, a/2), but that's just the center of the cube, so that's only one point.Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.Wait, perhaps the four vertices of the tetrahedron are the four vertices of the cube that are not adjacent to a single vertex. For example, in a cube, each vertex is connected to three others. If I take the four vertices that are not connected to a particular vertex, they form a tetrahedron.Let me see: take the cube with vertices (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), (0,a,a), and (a,a,a). If I exclude the vertex (0,0,0), the remaining seven vertices include its adjacent vertices (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), and the opposite vertex (a,a,a). Wait, no, (a,a,a) is opposite to (0,0,0). So, if I take the four vertices that are not adjacent to (0,0,0), which are (a,a,0), (a,0,a), (0,a,a), and (a,a,a). Hmm, but (a,a,a) is connected to (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). So, connecting these four points, is that a regular tetrahedron?Let me calculate the distances. The distance between (a,a,0) and (a,0,a) is ( sqrt{(0)^2 + (a)^2 + (a)^2} = asqrt{2} ). Similarly, the distance between (a,a,0) and (0,a,a) is also ( asqrt{2} ). The distance between (a,a,0) and (a,a,a) is ( a ). Wait, so some edges are length ( asqrt{2} ) and others are length ( a ). That's not a regular tetrahedron.So, that approach doesn't work either.Wait, maybe I need to choose four vertices such that each pair is connected by a face diagonal. So, each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal of the cube.In a cube, the face diagonal has length ( asqrt{2} ). If I can form a tetrahedron where each edge is a face diagonal, then it would be a regular tetrahedron.How can I choose four vertices such that each pair is connected by a face diagonal?Let me think about the cube. Each face has two face diagonals. If I can select four vertices such that each pair lies on a different face and their connecting edge is a face diagonal.Wait, maybe if I take two opposite edges of the cube and connect their midpoints. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of a tetrahedron inscribed in a cube. I think there is a standard way to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube by selecting four alternate vertices.Let me recall: in a cube, if you select four vertices such that no two are adjacent, you can form a regular tetrahedron. For example, selecting (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). Let me check the distances between these points.Distance between (0,0,0) and (a,a,0): ( sqrt{(a)^2 + (a)^2 + 0} = asqrt{2} ).Distance between (0,0,0) and (a,0,a): ( sqrt{(a)^2 + 0 + (a)^2} = asqrt{2} ).Distance between (0,0,0) and (0,a,a): ( sqrt{0 + (a)^2 + (a)^2} = asqrt{2} ).Now, distance between (a,a,0) and (a,0,a): ( sqrt{0 + (a)^2 + (a)^2} = asqrt{2} ).Distance between (a,a,0) and (0,a,a): ( sqrt{(a)^2 + 0 + (a)^2} = asqrt{2} ).Distance between (a,0,a) and (0,a,a): ( sqrt{(a)^2 + (a)^2 + 0} = asqrt{2} ).Okay, so all edges are equal, so this is indeed a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( asqrt{2} ).Great, so now I can use this configuration to find the volume of the tetrahedron.First, let's recall the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron. The volume ( V ) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( s ) is given by:[ V = frac{s^3}{6sqrt{2}} ]Alternatively, it can also be written as:[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} s^3 ]I think both formulas are equivalent. Let me verify:[ frac{s^3}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{s^3 sqrt{2}}{12} ]Yes, because multiplying numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{2} ):[ frac{s^3}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{s^3 sqrt{2}}{6 times 2} = frac{s^3 sqrt{2}}{12} ]So, both expressions are correct.Now, in our case, the edge length ( s ) is ( asqrt{2} ). Plugging this into the formula:[ V = frac{(asqrt{2})^3}{6sqrt{2}} ]Let's compute ( (asqrt{2})^3 ):[ (asqrt{2})^3 = a^3 (sqrt{2})^3 = a^3 times 2^{3/2} = a^3 times 2 sqrt{2} ]So, substituting back:[ V = frac{a^3 times 2 sqrt{2}}{6 sqrt{2}} ]Simplify the expression:The ( sqrt{2} ) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:[ V = frac{a^3 times 2}{6} = frac{2a^3}{6} = frac{a^3}{3} ]Wait, that can't be right. If the volume of the tetrahedron is ( frac{a^3}{3} ), and the volume of the cube is ( a^3 ), then the ratio would be ( frac{1}{3} ). But I thought the ratio was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Let me double-check the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron. Maybe I used the wrong formula.Wait, another formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron is:[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} s^3 ]So, using this formula with ( s = asqrt{2} ):[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 ]Compute ( (asqrt{2})^3 ):[ (asqrt{2})^3 = a^3 times (2)^{3/2} = a^3 times 2 sqrt{2} ]So,[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times a^3 times 2 sqrt{2} ]Multiply ( sqrt{2} times 2 sqrt{2} ):[ sqrt{2} times 2 sqrt{2} = 2 times (sqrt{2} times sqrt{2}) = 2 times 2 = 4 ]So,[ V = frac{4 a^3}{12} = frac{a^3}{3} ]Hmm, same result. But I thought the ratio was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I'm confusing something.Wait, perhaps the edge length of the tetrahedron is not ( asqrt{2} ). Let me re-examine the coordinates.The four vertices of the tetrahedron are (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). Let's compute the distance between (0,0,0) and (a,a,0):[ sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (a-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2} ]Similarly, distance between (0,0,0) and (a,0,a):[ sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (a-0)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = asqrt{2} ]Same for the others. So, yes, the edge length is indeed ( asqrt{2} ).But then, according to the formula, the volume is ( frac{a^3}{3} ), which would make the ratio ( frac{1}{3} ). But I recall that the volume of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ) times the cube's volume. So, there must be a mistake here.Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the volume of the tetrahedron. Maybe I should compute it using coordinates instead of relying on the regular tetrahedron formula.Yes, that might be a better approach. Let's use the coordinates of the four points to compute the volume.The four points are (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). Let's denote these as points A, B, C, D respectively.To find the volume of tetrahedron ABCD, we can use the scalar triple product formula:[ V = frac{1}{6} | vec{AB} cdot (vec{AC} times vec{AD}) | ]First, let's find vectors AB, AC, and AD.Vector AB = B - A = (a,a,0) - (0,0,0) = (a,a,0)Vector AC = C - A = (a,0,a) - (0,0,0) = (a,0,a)Vector AD = D - A = (0,a,a) - (0,0,0) = (0,a,a)Now, compute the cross product ( vec{AC} times vec{AD} ):Let me denote ( vec{AC} = (a,0,a) ) and ( vec{AD} = (0,a,a) ).The cross product is given by:[ vec{AC} times vec{AD} = begin{vmatrix} mathbf{i} & mathbf{j} & mathbf{k}  a & 0 & a  0 & a & a end{vmatrix} ]Compute the determinant:- The i-component: ( 0 times a - a times a = 0 - a^2 = -a^2 )- The j-component: ( -(a times a - a times 0) = -(a^2 - 0) = -a^2 )- The k-component: ( a times a - 0 times 0 = a^2 - 0 = a^2 )So,[ vec{AC} times vec{AD} = (-a^2, -a^2, a^2) ]Now, compute the dot product ( vec{AB} cdot (vec{AC} times vec{AD}) ):( vec{AB} = (a,a,0) )Dot product:[ (a,a,0) cdot (-a^2, -a^2, a^2) = a times (-a^2) + a times (-a^2) + 0 times a^2 = -a^3 - a^3 + 0 = -2a^3 ]Taking the absolute value:[ | -2a^3 | = 2a^3 ]Now, the volume is:[ V = frac{1}{6} times 2a^3 = frac{2a^3}{6} = frac{a^3}{3} ]So, the volume of the tetrahedron is ( frac{a^3}{3} ), and the volume of the cube is ( a^3 ). Therefore, the ratio is:[ frac{frac{a^3}{3}}{a^3} = frac{1}{3} ]Wait, but I thought the ratio was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Did I make a mistake somewhere?Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The problem says \\"a regular tetrahedron is formed by joining four vertices of a cube such that each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" In my calculation, I considered four vertices, each on a different face, and found the volume ratio to be ( frac{1}{3} ). But I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ).Let me check another source or think differently. Maybe the edge length of the tetrahedron is not ( asqrt{2} ), but something else.Wait, no, the edge length is definitely ( asqrt{2} ) because the distance between (0,0,0) and (a,a,0) is ( asqrt{2} ). So, why is the volume coming out as ( frac{a^3}{3} )?Wait, maybe the formula I used for the volume of a regular tetrahedron is incorrect. Let me double-check.The formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( s ) is indeed ( V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} s^3 ). So, if ( s = asqrt{2} ), then:[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} a^3 = frac{sqrt{2} times 2sqrt{2}}{12} a^3 = frac{4}{12} a^3 = frac{1}{3} a^3 ]So, that's consistent with the scalar triple product result. Therefore, the volume ratio is indeed ( frac{1}{3} ).But wait, I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I was confusing it with another problem.Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is not regular? Wait, no, the problem states it's a regular tetrahedron. So, my calculation must be correct.Wait, let me think again. If the edge length is ( asqrt{2} ), then the volume is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} a^3 = frac{4}{12} a^3 = frac{1}{3} a^3 ). So, yes, the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But I'm still confused because I thought the ratio was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I was thinking of a different configuration.Wait, perhaps the tetrahedron is not formed by four vertices of the cube, but by connecting midpoints or something else. Let me clarify.The problem says: \\"a regular tetrahedron is formed by joining four vertices of a cube such that each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" So, it's definitely four vertices of the cube, each on a different face.In my calculation, I took four vertices: (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). Each of these is on a different face:- (0,0,0) is on the face where x=0.- (a,a,0) is on the face where z=0.- (a,0,a) is on the face where y=0.- (0,a,a) is on the face where x=0? Wait, no, (0,a,a) is on the face where x=0, but (0,0,0) is also on x=0. So, actually, two vertices are on the same face, which contradicts the problem statement.Oh no! That's a mistake. The problem says each vertex belongs to a different face. So, in my selection, two vertices are on the x=0 face, which is not allowed.I need to choose four vertices, each on a different face. So, each vertex must lie on a distinct face of the cube.In a cube, there are six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom. So, I need to select four vertices, each on a different face, meaning four different faces are used, and two faces are not used.Wait, but each vertex of the cube belongs to three faces. So, if I choose four vertices, each on a different face, I need to ensure that no two vertices share a common face.But in a cube, each vertex is shared by three faces. So, if I choose four vertices, each on a different face, I need to ensure that each vertex is on a unique face, and no two vertices share a common face.Wait, but since each vertex is on three faces, it's impossible for four vertices to each be on a different face without overlapping, because there are only six faces. Wait, no, because each vertex is on three faces, but we can choose four vertices such that each is on a different set of faces.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting four vertices such that each is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a unique face, not necessarily that all four faces are distinct.Wait, no, the problem says \\"each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" So, each vertex is on a different face, meaning that all four vertices are on four different faces.But a cube has six faces, so it's possible to choose four vertices, each on a different face.Wait, let me think of the cube with faces: front (z=a), back (z=0), left (x=0), right (x=a), top (y=a), bottom (y=0).If I choose four vertices, each on a different face, I need to pick one vertex from four different faces.For example:- Front face (z=a): (a, a, a)- Back face (z=0): (0, 0, 0)- Left face (x=0): (0, a, 0)- Right face (x=a): (a, 0, a)Wait, but (a, 0, a) is on the right face (x=a) and top face (y=0)? Wait, no, (a,0,a) is on the right face (x=a) and top face (y=0)? Wait, no, (a,0,a) is on the right face (x=a) and top face (z=a). Wait, no, z=a is the front face.Wait, (a,0,a) is on the right face (x=a) and front face (z=a). So, if I choose (a,0,a), it's on two faces: right and front. Similarly, (0,a,0) is on left and back.Wait, but the problem says each vertex belongs to a different face. So, each vertex must belong to a unique face, not sharing with any other vertex.Wait, that might not be possible because each vertex is on three faces, and we have four vertices, so we'd need 4 unique faces, but each vertex is on three faces, so it's possible that some faces are shared among vertices.Wait, maybe the problem means that each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a distinct face, not necessarily that all four faces are distinct.Wait, the wording is: \\"each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" So, each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a unique face, not shared with any other vertex.But since each vertex is on three faces, and we have four vertices, it's impossible for all four vertices to be on four different faces without overlapping, because each vertex is on three faces, and we have only six faces.Wait, maybe the problem means that each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a distinct face, but not necessarily that all four faces are distinct. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a face that is different from the faces of the other vertices. But since each vertex is on three faces, it's possible that each vertex is on a unique combination of faces.Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look for a standard configuration.I recall that in a cube, you can form a regular tetrahedron by selecting four vertices such that each pair is connected by a face diagonal. For example, selecting (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a). But as I saw earlier, two of these vertices are on the same face, which contradicts the problem statement.Wait, no, in that configuration, each vertex is on a different face. Let me check:- (0,0,0): on x=0, y=0, z=0- (a,a,0): on x=a, y=a, z=0- (a,0,a): on x=a, y=0, z=a- (0,a,a): on x=0, y=a, z=aSo, each vertex is on three faces, but the four vertices together cover all six faces of the cube. So, each vertex is on a different set of faces, but not necessarily that each vertex is on a unique single face.Wait, the problem says \\"each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" So, maybe each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a unique face, not sharing a face with any other vertex.But in the cube, each face has four vertices. So, if I choose four vertices, each on a different face, it's possible that each vertex is on a unique face, but since each vertex is on three faces, it's a bit tricky.Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the standard regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube has a volume ratio of ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ), but in my calculation, I got ( frac{1}{3} ). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the configuration.Wait, let me think again. If I take four vertices of the cube such that each is on a different face, and they form a regular tetrahedron, then the edge length of the tetrahedron is the face diagonal of the cube, which is ( asqrt{2} ). Then, the volume of the tetrahedron is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} a^3 = frac{4}{12} a^3 = frac{1}{3} a^3 ). So, the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I was confusing it with a different tetrahedron.Wait, perhaps the tetrahedron is not formed by four vertices of the cube, but by connecting midpoints or something else. Let me check.If I take the midpoints of four edges of the cube, each on a different face, and form a tetrahedron, what would be its volume?For example, take midpoints at (a/2,0,0), (0,a/2,0), (0,0,a/2), and (a/2,a/2,a/2). Wait, but (a/2,a/2,a/2) is the center of the cube, not a midpoint of an edge. So, maybe not.Alternatively, take midpoints of four edges that are all on different faces. For example:- (a/2,0,0) on the front face (z=0)- (0,a/2,0) on the right face (x=0)- (0,0,a/2) on the top face (y=0)- (a/2,a/2,a) on the back face (z=a)Wait, but (a/2,a/2,a) is on the back face and also on the top face (y=a/2). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe take midpoints of four edges that are all on different faces and not overlapping.Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with the initial configuration where four vertices of the cube form a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( asqrt{2} ), and the volume ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But I'm still confused because I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I need to double-check the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron.Wait, let me derive the volume formula for a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( s ).Consider a regular tetrahedron with vertices at (0,0,0), (s,0,0), (s/2, ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} s ), 0), and (s/2, ( frac{sqrt{3}}{6} s ), ( frac{sqrt{6}}{3} s )). The volume can be calculated using the scalar triple product.But maybe it's easier to use the formula ( V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} s^3 ).Given that, if the edge length is ( asqrt{2} ), then:[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} a^3 = frac{4}{12} a^3 = frac{1}{3} a^3 ]So, the volume is indeed ( frac{1}{3} a^3 ), and the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).Wait, but I think I remember that the volume of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ) times the cube's volume. Maybe I'm confusing it with a different tetrahedron.Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is not regular. Wait, no, the problem states it's a regular tetrahedron.Wait, maybe the edge length is not ( asqrt{2} ). Let me think again.If I take four vertices of the cube such that each is on a different face, and they form a regular tetrahedron, what is the edge length?Let me consider the cube with side length 1 for simplicity. So, a=1.If I take the four vertices: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1), as before.The distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) is ( sqrt{2} ).The distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,1) is ( sqrt{2} ).The distance between (0,0,0) and (0,1,1) is ( sqrt{2} ).The distance between (1,1,0) and (1,0,1) is ( sqrt{(0)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2} = sqrt{2} ).Similarly, all other distances are ( sqrt{2} ). So, the edge length is indeed ( sqrt{2} ).So, the volume of the tetrahedron is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (sqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} = frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{3} ).Therefore, the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But wait, I'm still confused because I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I was thinking of a different configuration where the tetrahedron is formed by connecting the centers of four faces, but that would not be a regular tetrahedron.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different regular tetrahedron, not the one formed by four vertices of the cube.Wait, let me think of another way. Maybe the regular tetrahedron is formed by connecting the midpoints of four edges of the cube, each on a different face.For example, take midpoints at (a/2,0,0), (0,a/2,0), (0,0,a/2), and (a/2,a/2,a/2). Wait, but (a/2,a/2,a/2) is the center of the cube, not a midpoint of an edge.Alternatively, take midpoints of four edges that are all on different faces. For example:- (a/2,0,0) on the front face (z=0)- (0,a/2,0) on the right face (x=0)- (0,0,a/2) on the top face (y=0)- (a/2,a/2,a) on the back face (z=a)Wait, but (a/2,a/2,a) is on the back face and also on the top face (y=a/2). So, it's on two faces.But the problem says each vertex belongs to a different face, so each vertex must be on a unique face. So, in this case, (a/2,0,0) is on front face, (0,a/2,0) on right face, (0,0,a/2) on top face, and (a/2,a/2,a) on back face. So, each vertex is on a different face.Now, let's compute the edge length of this tetrahedron.Distance between (a/2,0,0) and (0,a/2,0):[ sqrt{(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + 0} = sqrt{a^2/4 + a^2/4} = sqrt{a^2/2} = a/sqrt{2} ]Similarly, distance between (a/2,0,0) and (0,0,a/2):[ sqrt{(a/2)^2 + 0 + (a/2)^2} = sqrt{a^2/4 + a^2/4} = a/sqrt{2} ]Distance between (a/2,0,0) and (a/2,a/2,a):[ sqrt{0 + (a/2)^2 + (a)^2} = sqrt{a^2/4 + a^2} = sqrt{5a^2/4} = (asqrt{5})/2 ]Wait, that's not equal to the previous distances. So, the edge lengths are not equal, meaning this is not a regular tetrahedron.Therefore, this configuration does not form a regular tetrahedron.So, going back, the only way to form a regular tetrahedron by joining four vertices of a cube, each on a different face, is by selecting four vertices such that each pair is connected by a face diagonal, resulting in edge length ( asqrt{2} ), and volume ( frac{1}{3} a^3 ), giving a ratio of ( frac{1}{3} ).But I'm still unsure because I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I need to verify with another method.Wait, let's consider the cube with side length 1, so a=1. Then, the volume of the cube is 1.The regular tetrahedron formed by four vertices as described has volume ( frac{1}{3} ), so the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the regular tetrahedron is not formed by four vertices of the cube, but by connecting midpoints or something else.Wait, no, the problem clearly states \\"formed by joining four vertices of a cube.\\" So, it must be four vertices of the cube.Therefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But to be thorough, let me check another source or think of another way.Wait, I found a resource that says the volume of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube with edge length 'a' is ( frac{a^3}{3} ), so the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).Therefore, I think the correct ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).But wait, another thought: maybe the regular tetrahedron is formed by connecting four alternate vertices of the cube, not the ones I considered earlier.Wait, in a cube, there are two regular tetrahedrons that can be inscribed, each using four alternate vertices. For example, one tetrahedron uses (0,0,0), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), and (0,a,a), and the other uses (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), and (a,a,a). Both are regular tetrahedrons.So, in both cases, the edge length is ( asqrt{2} ), and the volume is ( frac{1}{3} a^3 ), giving a ratio of ( frac{1}{3} ).Therefore, I think the correct answer is ( frac{1}{3} ).But wait, I'm still confused because I thought the answer was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ). Maybe I was thinking of a different problem where the tetrahedron is formed by connecting the centers of four faces of the cube, but that's not a regular tetrahedron.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a tetrahedron formed by connecting four vertices of the cube, but not necessarily all on different faces. But the problem specifically says \\"each vertex belongs to a different face.\\"Wait, in my initial configuration, two vertices were on the same face, which was a mistake. So, I need to ensure that each vertex is on a different face.Wait, let me try again. Let's select four vertices such that each is on a different face.For example:- (0,0,0): on x=0, y=0, z=0- (a,a,0): on x=a, y=a, z=0- (a,0,a): on x=a, y=0, z=a- (0,a,a): on x=0, y=a, z=aNow, checking the faces:- (0,0,0) is on x=0, y=0, z=0- (a,a,0) is on x=a, y=a, z=0- (a,0,a) is on x=a, y=0, z=a- (0,a,a) is on x=0, y=a, z=aSo, each vertex is on three faces, but the four vertices together cover all six faces of the cube. So, each vertex is on a different combination of faces, but not necessarily on a unique single face.Wait, the problem says \\"each vertex belongs to a different face.\\" So, maybe each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a unique face, not sharing a face with any other vertex.But in this configuration, (0,0,0) is on x=0, y=0, z=0, and (a,a,0) is on x=a, y=a, z=0. So, both are on z=0 face, which violates the condition.Therefore, I need to choose four vertices such that each is on a different face, meaning that no two vertices share a common face.But in a cube, each face has four vertices, and each vertex is on three faces. So, it's impossible to choose four vertices such that each is on a different face without overlapping, because each vertex is on three faces, and we have only six faces.Wait, maybe the problem means that each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a unique face, not necessarily that all four faces are distinct.Wait, that doesn't make sense because each vertex is on three faces.Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that each vertex is on a different face, meaning that each vertex is on a face that is different from the faces of the other vertices. But since each vertex is on three faces, it's possible that each vertex is on a unique combination of faces.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should accept that the volume ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ) based on the calculation, even though I thought it was ( frac{sqrt{2}}{12} ).But to be sure, let me calculate the volume of the regular tetrahedron with edge length ( s = asqrt{2} ) using the formula ( V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} s^3 ):[ V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} (asqrt{2})^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} times 2sqrt{2} a^3 = frac{4}{12} a^3 = frac{1}{3} a^3 ]Yes, that's consistent. So, the ratio is ( frac{1}{3} ).Therefore, the answer is ( frac{1}{3} )."},{"question":"If the function f(x)=(x^{2}+mx+1)e^{x} is monotonically decreasing on the interval left[-1,1right], then the range of real number m is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of the real number ( m ) such that the function ( f(x) = (x^2 + m x + 1)e^x ) is monotonically decreasing on the interval ([-1, 1]). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that for a function to be monotonically decreasing on an interval, its derivative must be less than or equal to zero throughout that interval. So, my first task is to find the derivative of ( f(x) ).The function ( f(x) ) is a product of two functions: ( u(x) = x^2 + m x + 1 ) and ( v(x) = e^x ). To find the derivative, I'll use the product rule, which states that ( (u cdot v)' = u' cdot v + u cdot v' ).Let me compute ( u'(x) ) and ( v'(x) ):- ( u'(x) = 2x + m )- ( v'(x) = e^x ) (since the derivative of ( e^x ) is itself)So, applying the product rule:[f'(x) = (2x + m)e^x + (x^2 + m x + 1)e^x]I can factor out ( e^x ) since it's common to both terms:[f'(x) = e^x left(2x + m + x^2 + m x + 1right)]Simplifying inside the parentheses:[f'(x) = e^x left(x^2 + (2 + m)x + (m + 1)right)]Okay, so ( f'(x) = e^x (x^2 + (m + 2)x + (m + 1)) ).Now, since ( e^x ) is always positive for any real ( x ), the sign of ( f'(x) ) depends entirely on the quadratic expression ( x^2 + (m + 2)x + (m + 1) ). For ( f(x) ) to be monotonically decreasing on ([-1, 1]), ( f'(x) ) must be less than or equal to zero for all ( x ) in that interval. Therefore, the quadratic expression must be less than or equal to zero on ([-1, 1]).Let me denote the quadratic as ( q(x) = x^2 + (m + 2)x + (m + 1) ). So, we need ( q(x) leq 0 ) for all ( x in [-1, 1] ).Now, to ensure that ( q(x) leq 0 ) on the entire interval, I need to analyze the quadratic function ( q(x) ). Quadratic functions can open upwards or downwards, depending on the coefficient of ( x^2 ). In this case, the coefficient is 1, which is positive, so the parabola opens upwards.Since it opens upwards, the minimum value of ( q(x) ) occurs at its vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = m + 2 ), so the vertex is at:[x = -frac{m + 2}{2}]Now, for ( q(x) ) to be less than or equal to zero on ([-1, 1]), the entire interval must lie to the left of the vertex if the vertex is to the right of the interval, or to the right of the vertex if the vertex is to the left of the interval. But since the parabola opens upwards, the function will be decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right.Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think again. Since the parabola opens upwards, the function decreases until the vertex and then increases after the vertex. So, to have ( q(x) leq 0 ) on the entire interval ([-1, 1]), the maximum value of ( q(x) ) on this interval must be less than or equal to zero.But the maximum of ( q(x) ) on ([-1, 1]) would occur at one of the endpoints since the function is decreasing before the vertex and increasing after the vertex. So, if the vertex is inside the interval ([-1, 1]), then the maximum would be at one of the endpoints. If the vertex is outside the interval, then the maximum would still be at one of the endpoints.Therefore, to ensure ( q(x) leq 0 ) on ([-1, 1]), it's sufficient to ensure that ( q(-1) leq 0 ) and ( q(1) leq 0 ).Let me compute ( q(-1) ) and ( q(1) ):- ( q(-1) = (-1)^2 + (m + 2)(-1) + (m + 1) = 1 - m - 2 + m + 1 = 1 - m - 2 + m + 1 = 0 )- ( q(1) = (1)^2 + (m + 2)(1) + (m + 1) = 1 + m + 2 + m + 1 = 2m + 4 )Wait, so ( q(-1) = 0 ) regardless of ( m ). Interesting. And ( q(1) = 2m + 4 ). So, for ( q(1) leq 0 ), we need:[2m + 4 leq 0 implies 2m leq -4 implies m leq -2]So, ( m leq -2 ) ensures that ( q(1) leq 0 ). But since ( q(-1) = 0 ), and the function is decreasing from ( x = -1 ) to the vertex, and then increasing from the vertex to ( x = 1 ), we need to make sure that the maximum at ( x = 1 ) is non-positive.But wait, what if the vertex is inside the interval ([-1, 1])? Let me check where the vertex is.The vertex is at ( x = -frac{m + 2}{2} ). So, if ( -frac{m + 2}{2} ) is within ([-1, 1]), then the function ( q(x) ) has its minimum inside the interval, and the maximum would still be at one of the endpoints. However, if the vertex is outside the interval, then the function is either entirely decreasing or increasing over the interval.Let me find for which ( m ) the vertex is inside ([-1, 1]):[-1 leq -frac{m + 2}{2} leq 1]Multiply all parts by 2:[-2 leq -(m + 2) leq 2]Multiply by -1 and reverse inequalities:[2 geq m + 2 geq -2]Subtract 2:[0 geq m geq -4]So, when ( m ) is between -4 and 0, the vertex is inside the interval ([-1, 1]). Otherwise, it's outside.But since we already have ( m leq -2 ) from the condition ( q(1) leq 0 ), let's see where that places the vertex.If ( m leq -2 ), then ( m + 2 leq 0 ), so ( -frac{m + 2}{2} geq 0 ). So, the vertex is at ( x geq 0 ). Specifically, when ( m = -2 ), the vertex is at ( x = -frac{-2 + 2}{2} = 0 ). When ( m < -2 ), the vertex is at ( x > 0 ).So, for ( m leq -2 ), the vertex is at ( x geq 0 ). Therefore, on the interval ([-1, 1]), the function ( q(x) ) is decreasing from ( x = -1 ) to ( x = 0 ) and then increasing from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 1 ). But since ( q(-1) = 0 ) and ( q(1) leq 0 ), and the function is decreasing then increasing, the maximum value on the interval is at ( x = -1 ) or ( x = 1 ). But ( q(-1) = 0 ) and ( q(1) leq 0 ), so the maximum is 0, which is acceptable because we need ( q(x) leq 0 ).Wait, but what about the value at the vertex? If the vertex is inside the interval, then the minimum is at the vertex, but since the function is opening upwards, the minimum is the lowest point. So, if the minimum is above zero, then the entire function would be above zero, which is not what we want. But in our case, since ( q(-1) = 0 ) and ( q(1) leq 0 ), and the function is decreasing then increasing, the minimum at the vertex must be less than or equal to zero as well.Let me compute ( q ) at the vertex. The vertex is at ( x = -frac{m + 2}{2} ). Let me denote this as ( x_v = -frac{m + 2}{2} ).Compute ( q(x_v) ):[q(x_v) = (x_v)^2 + (m + 2)x_v + (m + 1)]Substitute ( x_v = -frac{m + 2}{2} ):[q(x_v) = left(-frac{m + 2}{2}right)^2 + (m + 2)left(-frac{m + 2}{2}right) + (m + 1)]Simplify each term:- First term: ( left(frac{m + 2}{2}right)^2 = frac{(m + 2)^2}{4} )- Second term: ( -(m + 2)^2 / 2 )- Third term: ( m + 1 )So, combining them:[q(x_v) = frac{(m + 2)^2}{4} - frac{(m + 2)^2}{2} + (m + 1)]Simplify:[q(x_v) = -frac{(m + 2)^2}{4} + (m + 1)]Let me write this as:[q(x_v) = -frac{(m + 2)^2}{4} + m + 1]Now, since we need ( q(x) leq 0 ) for all ( x in [-1, 1] ), and the minimum of ( q(x) ) is at ( x = x_v ), we need ( q(x_v) leq 0 ).So, set:[-frac{(m + 2)^2}{4} + m + 1 leq 0]Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:[-(m + 2)^2 + 4m + 4 leq 0]Expand ( (m + 2)^2 ):[-(m^2 + 4m + 4) + 4m + 4 leq 0]Distribute the negative sign:[-m^2 - 4m - 4 + 4m + 4 leq 0]Simplify:[-m^2 leq 0]Which simplifies to:[m^2 geq 0]But ( m^2 ) is always greater than or equal to zero for any real ( m ). So, this inequality is always true. Therefore, the condition ( q(x_v) leq 0 ) is automatically satisfied for any real ( m ).Wait, that seems interesting. So, regardless of ( m ), the minimum of ( q(x) ) is less than or equal to zero. But we already have the condition that ( q(1) leq 0 ), which gives ( m leq -2 ). So, combining these, the only condition we need is ( m leq -2 ).But let me double-check this. Suppose ( m = -3 ), which is less than -2. Then, ( q(x) = x^2 + (-3 + 2)x + (-3 + 1) = x^2 - x - 2 ). Let's see if this is less than or equal to zero on ([-1, 1]).Compute ( q(-1) = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0 )Compute ( q(1) = 1 - 1 - 2 = -2 )Compute the vertex at ( x = -frac{-3 + 2}{2} = frac{1}{2} )Compute ( q(0.5) = (0.5)^2 - 0.5 - 2 = 0.25 - 0.5 - 2 = -2.25 )So, yes, ( q(x) leq 0 ) on ([-1, 1]).What about ( m = -2 )? Then, ( q(x) = x^2 + 0x + (-2 + 1) = x^2 - 1 )Compute ( q(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 )Compute ( q(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 )Compute the vertex at ( x = -frac{-2 + 2}{2} = 0 )Compute ( q(0) = 0 - 1 = -1 )So, ( q(x) leq 0 ) on ([-1, 1]).What if ( m = -1 ), which is greater than -2? Then, ( q(x) = x^2 + (-1 + 2)x + (-1 + 1) = x^2 + x + 0 = x^2 + x )Compute ( q(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 )Compute ( q(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 )So, ( q(1) = 2 > 0 ), which violates the condition ( q(x) leq 0 ). Hence, ( m = -1 ) is not acceptable.Similarly, if ( m = 0 ), ( q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2 ), which is always non-negative, so ( q(x) geq 0 ), which is the opposite of what we need.Therefore, it seems that the condition ( m leq -2 ) is necessary and sufficient for ( q(x) leq 0 ) on ([-1, 1]), ensuring that ( f'(x) leq 0 ) and hence ( f(x) ) is monotonically decreasing on that interval.Just to be thorough, let me check another value, say ( m = -4 ). Then, ( q(x) = x^2 + (-4 + 2)x + (-4 + 1) = x^2 - 2x - 3 )Compute ( q(-1) = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0 )Compute ( q(1) = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4 )Compute the vertex at ( x = -frac{-4 + 2}{2} = 1 )Compute ( q(1) = -4 ) as aboveSo, ( q(x) leq 0 ) on ([-1, 1]).Another test: ( m = -5 ), then ( q(x) = x^2 + (-5 + 2)x + (-5 + 1) = x^2 - 3x - 4 )Compute ( q(-1) = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0 )Compute ( q(1) = 1 - 3 - 4 = -6 )Vertex at ( x = -frac{-5 + 2}{2} = frac{3}{2} ), which is outside the interval ([-1, 1]). So, on ([-1, 1]), the function is decreasing since the vertex is to the right. Therefore, the maximum is at ( x = -1 ), which is 0, and the minimum at ( x = 1 ) is -6, so ( q(x) leq 0 ) on the interval.Therefore, all these tests confirm that ( m leq -2 ) is indeed the correct range.In summary, to ensure that ( f(x) = (x^2 + m x + 1)e^x ) is monotonically decreasing on ([-1, 1]), the derivative ( f'(x) ) must be non-positive on that interval. This leads us to the condition that the quadratic ( q(x) = x^2 + (m + 2)x + (m + 1) ) must be less than or equal to zero on ([-1, 1]). By analyzing the quadratic and ensuring its maximum on the interval is non-positive, we find that ( m ) must be less than or equal to -2."},{"question":"Find the sum frac{3^1}{9^1 - 1} + frac{3^2}{9^2 - 1} + frac{3^4}{9^4 - 1} + frac{3^8}{9^8 - 1} + cdots.","answer":"Okay, so I have this series to find the sum of: frac{3^1}{9^1 - 1} + frac{3^2}{9^2 - 1} + frac{3^4}{9^4 - 1} + frac{3^8}{9^8 - 1} + cdots.Hmm, let me see. The terms are of the form frac{3^{2^k}}{9^{2^k} - 1} where k starts from 0. So, the exponents are powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. That seems like a geometric progression in the exponents, but each term is squared each time. First, let me write out the general term more clearly. The k-th term is:frac{3^{2^k}}{9^{2^k} - 1}.I notice that 9 is 3^2, so I can rewrite the denominator as (3^2)^{2^k} - 1 = 3^{2 cdot 2^k} - 1 = 3^{2^{k+1}} - 1. So, the term becomes:frac{3^{2^k}}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.Hmm, that looks a bit simpler. Maybe I can factor this or find a telescoping series. Telescoping series often involve expressing each term as a difference of two fractions that cancel out when summed.Let me try to manipulate the term:frac{3^{2^k}}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.I can write the denominator as (3^{2^k})^2 - 1, which is a difference of squares. So, factoring that, we get:(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1).So, the term becomes:frac{3^{2^k}}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1)}.Hmm, maybe I can split this into partial fractions. Let me set:frac{3^{2^k}}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1)} = frac{A}{3^{2^k} - 1} + frac{B}{3^{2^k} + 1}.Multiplying both sides by (3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1) gives:3^{2^k} = A(3^{2^k} + 1) + B(3^{2^k} - 1).Let me solve for A and B. Expanding the right side:3^{2^k} = (A + B)3^{2^k} + (A - B).Comparing coefficients on both sides:For 3^{2^k}: 1 = A + B.For the constant term: 0 = A - B.So, from the second equation, A = B. Plugging into the first equation: 1 = A + A = 2A, so A = 1/2 and B = 1/2.Therefore, the term can be written as:frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} + frac{1}{3^{2^k} + 1}right).Wait, but that doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Let me check again.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the term as a difference instead of a sum. Let me try:frac{3^{2^k}}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1)} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^k} + 1}right).Let me verify this:frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^k} + 1}right) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{(3^{2^k} + 1) - (3^{2^k} - 1)}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^k} + 1)}right) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{2}{(3^{2^k})^2 - 1}right) = frac{1}{(3^{2^k})^2 - 1} = frac{1}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.Wait, that's not the same as the original term. The original term was frac{3^{2^k}}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}. So, this approach gives me a different expression. Maybe I need a different way to split the fraction.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the term as:frac{3^{2^k}}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1} = frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.Let me check this:frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1} = frac{(3^{2^{k+1}} - 1) - (3^{2^k} - 1)}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^{k+1}} - 1)} = frac{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1 - 3^{2^k} + 1}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^{k+1}} - 1)} = frac{3^{2^{k+1}} - 3^{2^k}}{(3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^{k+1}} - 1)}.Factor numerator:3^{2^k}(3^{2^k} - 1).So, numerator is 3^{2^k}(3^{2^k} - 1), denominator is (3^{2^k} - 1)(3^{2^{k+1}} - 1). So, we can cancel (3^{2^k} - 1):frac{3^{2^k}}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.Yes! That works. So, the term can be written as:frac{1}{3^{2^k} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}.Great, so each term is a difference of reciprocals. That suggests that the series telescopes. Let me write out the first few terms:For k=0: frac{1}{3^{2^0} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^1} - 1} = frac{1}{3 - 1} - frac{1}{9 - 1} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{8}.For k=1: frac{1}{3^{2^1} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^2} - 1} = frac{1}{9 - 1} - frac{1}{81 - 1} = frac{1}{8} - frac{1}{80}.For k=2: frac{1}{3^{2^2} - 1} - frac{1}{3^{2^3} - 1} = frac{1}{81 - 1} - frac{1}{6561 - 1} = frac{1}{80} - frac{1}{6560}.And so on.When we add these up, the intermediate terms cancel out:- The -1/8 from the first term cancels with the +1/8 from the second term.- The -1/80 from the second term cancels with the +1/80 from the third term.- This pattern continues indefinitely.So, the sum of the series is just the first term of the first expression minus the limit of the last term as k approaches infinity.The first term is frac{1}{3^{2^0} - 1} = frac{1}{3 - 1} = frac{1}{2}.Now, what happens to the last term as k approaches infinity? The term is -frac{1}{3^{2^{k+1}} - 1}. As k increases, 2^{k+1} grows exponentially, so 3^{2^{k+1}} becomes extremely large, making the entire term approach zero.Therefore, the sum of the series is:frac{1}{2} - 0 = frac{1}{2}.So, the sum converges to frac{1}{2}."},{"question":"Ethyl bought Lucy some new dolls for her doll collection.

This means the new dolls represent 25% of the original number of dolls.Let ( x ) be the original number of dolls in Lucy's collection. The increase of 25% can be expressed as ( 0.25x ).After adding the new dolls, the total number of dolls becomes 10.

The probabilities are 0.4 for an apple, 0.3 for an orange, 0.2 for a banana, and 0.1 for a grape. What is the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit on a given day?","answer":"Alright, so I have this probability problem here about Joe choosing fruits for his meals. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that Joe randomly picks either an apple, orange, banana, or grape at each meal—breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The probabilities for each fruit are given: 0.4 for an apple, 0.3 for an orange, 0.2 for a banana, and 0.1 for a grape. The question is asking for the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit in a day.Hmm, okay. So, Joe has three meals a day, and for each meal, he picks one of these four fruits with the specified probabilities. I need to find the probability that he doesn't eat the same fruit for all three meals. That is, he eats at least two different kinds of fruits throughout the day.I think the best way to approach this is by using the complementary probability. Instead of directly calculating the probability of eating at least two different fruits, I can calculate the probability of the opposite event—eating the same fruit for all three meals—and then subtract that from 1.So, let's break it down. First, I need to find the probability that Joe eats the same fruit for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There are four fruits, so I'll calculate the probability for each fruit and then sum them up.Starting with apples. The probability of choosing an apple is 0.4. Since the choices are independent for each meal, the probability of choosing an apple three times in a row is 0.4 multiplied by itself three times, which is 0.4^3. Let me calculate that: 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16, and 0.16 * 0.4 = 0.064. So, the probability of eating apples for all three meals is 0.064.Next, oranges. The probability of choosing an orange is 0.3. Similarly, the probability of choosing oranges three times is 0.3^3. Calculating that: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09, and 0.09 * 0.3 = 0.027. So, the probability of eating oranges for all three meals is 0.027.Moving on to bananas. The probability here is 0.2. So, 0.2^3 would be the probability of eating bananas three times. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, and 0.04 * 0.2 = 0.008. Therefore, the probability of eating bananas for all three meals is 0.008.Lastly, grapes. The probability is 0.1. So, 0.1^3 is the probability of eating grapes three times. Calculating that: 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01, and 0.01 * 0.1 = 0.001. Hence, the probability of eating grapes for all three meals is 0.001.Now, to find the total probability of eating the same fruit for all three meals, I need to add up these probabilities. So, adding them together: 0.064 (apples) + 0.027 (oranges) + 0.008 (bananas) + 0.001 (grapes). Let me do that step by step.First, 0.064 + 0.027 = 0.091. Then, 0.091 + 0.008 = 0.099. Finally, 0.099 + 0.001 = 0.1. So, the total probability of eating the same fruit for all three meals is 0.1.Therefore, the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruits is the complement of eating the same fruit all day. To find this, I subtract the probability of eating the same fruit from 1. So, 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For apples: 0.4^3 is indeed 0.064. Oranges: 0.3^3 is 0.027. Bananas: 0.2^3 is 0.008. Grapes: 0.1^3 is 0.001. Adding them up: 0.064 + 0.027 is 0.091, plus 0.008 is 0.099, plus 0.001 is 0.1. Yes, that seems correct.So, the probability of eating the same fruit all day is 0.1, which means the probability of eating at least two different fruits is 0.9. That makes sense because it's more likely that Joe will vary his fruit choices throughout the day rather than sticking to the same one for all three meals.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my calculations. It seems straightforward once I break it down into calculating the complementary probability. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is 0.9."},{"question":"If sintheta and costheta are the two real roots of the equation 4x^2+2mx+m=0 with respect to x, then the value of m is (　　)A: m=-1- sqrt {5}B: m=1- sqrt {5}C: m=1pm sqrt {5}D: m=-1+ sqrt {5}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of ( m ) such that ( sintheta ) and ( costheta ) are the two real roots of the quadratic equation ( 4x^2 + 2mx + m = 0 ). The options given are A: ( m = -1 - sqrt{5} ), B: ( m = 1 - sqrt{5} ), C: ( m = 1 pm sqrt{5} ), and D: ( m = -1 + sqrt{5} ).First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots is ( -b/a ) and the product of the roots is ( c/a ). So, in this case, the sum of the roots ( sintheta + costheta ) should be equal to ( -2m/4 ), which simplifies to ( -m/2 ). Similarly, the product of the roots ( sintheta cdot costheta ) should be equal to ( m/4 ).So, I can write two equations based on Vieta's formulas:1. ( sintheta + costheta = -frac{m}{2} )2. ( sintheta cdot costheta = frac{m}{4} )Now, I also remember the trigonometric identity that ( (sintheta + costheta)^2 = sin^2theta + 2sinthetacostheta + cos^2theta ). Since ( sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1 ), this simplifies to ( 1 + 2sinthetacostheta ).Using the expressions from Vieta's formulas, I can substitute:( left(-frac{m}{2}right)^2 = 1 + 2 cdot frac{m}{4} )Let me compute that step by step:- Left side: ( left(-frac{m}{2}right)^2 = frac{m^2}{4} )- Right side: ( 1 + 2 cdot frac{m}{4} = 1 + frac{m}{2} )So, putting it together:( frac{m^2}{4} = 1 + frac{m}{2} )To eliminate the fractions, I can multiply both sides by 4:( m^2 = 4 + 2m )Now, bringing all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:( m^2 - 2m - 4 = 0 )I can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:( m = frac{2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-4)}}{2 cdot 1} )( m = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} )( m = frac{2 pm sqrt{20}}{2} )( m = frac{2 pm 2sqrt{5}}{2} )( m = 1 pm sqrt{5} )So, the possible values for ( m ) are ( 1 + sqrt{5} ) and ( 1 - sqrt{5} ).But wait, I need to check if these values satisfy the condition that the original quadratic equation has real roots. For a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) to have real roots, the discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac ) must be non-negative.Let's compute the discriminant for the original equation ( 4x^2 + 2mx + m = 0 ):( D = (2m)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot m = 4m^2 - 16m )We need ( D geq 0 ):( 4m^2 - 16m geq 0 )Divide both sides by 4:( m^2 - 4m geq 0 )Factor:( m(m - 4) geq 0 )This inequality holds when ( m leq 0 ) or ( m geq 4 ).Now, let's check the values ( m = 1 + sqrt{5} ) and ( m = 1 - sqrt{5} ):- ( 1 + sqrt{5} ) is approximately ( 1 + 2.236 = 3.236 ), which is less than 4, so it doesn't satisfy ( m geq 4 ).- ( 1 - sqrt{5} ) is approximately ( 1 - 2.236 = -1.236 ), which is less than 0, so it satisfies ( m leq 0 ).Therefore, ( m = 1 + sqrt{5} ) is not a valid solution because it doesn't satisfy the discriminant condition, while ( m = 1 - sqrt{5} ) is valid.Looking back at the options, ( m = 1 - sqrt{5} ) corresponds to option B.I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:1. Used Vieta's formulas to relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients.2. Applied the trigonometric identity to link the sum and product of ( sintheta ) and ( costheta ).3. Solved the resulting quadratic equation for ( m ).4. Checked the discriminant condition to ensure the roots are real.5. Discarded the invalid solution and confirmed the correct one.Everything seems to check out. So, yeah, the answer should be B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Let ABCDEF be a regular hexagon. Sides overline{AB} and overline{DE} are extended to meet at point Q. What is the degree measure of angle Q?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular hexagon named ABCDEF. The question is asking about the degree measure of angle Q, which is formed when sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, I remember that a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular hexagon is 120 degrees because the formula for each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n, where n is the number of sides. For a hexagon, that's ((6-2)*180)/6 = 720/6 = 120 degrees. So, each internal angle is 120 degrees.Now, the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, which means the vertices are in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, and then back to A. So, sides AB and DE are being extended to meet at point Q. I need to figure out where exactly point Q is located and then find the measure of angle Q.Let me try to sketch this mentally. In a regular hexagon, each side is equal, and the sides are all parallel in pairs. Specifically, sides AB and ED are parallel because of the regular structure. Wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to FE, and CD is parallel to AF. So, AB and DE are not opposite sides; rather, AB is adjacent to BC, and DE is adjacent to EF.Wait, maybe I should think about the positions of AB and DE. Let me label the hexagon in my mind: starting from A, going clockwise, it's A, B, C, D, E, F. So, side AB is between A and B, and side DE is between D and E. So, if I extend AB beyond B and DE beyond E, where would they meet? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the coordinates of the hexagon to get a better idea. If I place the hexagon on a coordinate system with center at the origin, each vertex can be represented with coordinates based on the unit circle. Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, the coordinates can be given as (cos θ, sin θ) where θ is 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, and back to 360°, which is the same as 0°.So, if I assign each vertex to these angles:- A: 0°, coordinates (1, 0)- B: 60°, coordinates (0.5, √3/2)- C: 120°, coordinates (-0.5, √3/2)- D: 180°, coordinates (-1, 0)- E: 240°, coordinates (-0.5, -√3/2)- F: 300°, coordinates (0.5, -√3/2)So, sides AB and DE. Let me find the equations of lines AB and DE when extended.First, let's find the coordinates:- Point A: (1, 0)- Point B: (0.5, √3/2)- Point D: (-1, 0)- Point E: (-0.5, -√3/2)So, line AB goes from (1, 0) to (0.5, √3/2). Let me find the slope of AB.Slope of AB: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (√3/2 - 0)/(0.5 - 1) = (√3/2)/(-0.5) = -√3.So, the equation of line AB is y - y1 = m(x - x1). Using point A (1, 0):y - 0 = -√3(x - 1) => y = -√3 x + √3.Now, line DE goes from D (-1, 0) to E (-0.5, -√3/2). Let me find the slope of DE.Slope of DE: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-√3/2 - 0)/(-0.5 - (-1)) = (-√3/2)/(0.5) = -√3.Wait, so both AB and DE have the same slope of -√3? That means they are parallel lines. But the problem says they are extended to meet at point Q. If they are parallel, they shouldn't meet unless they are the same line, which they aren't. Hmm, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slope. Let me double-check.For line AB: from A(1, 0) to B(0.5, √3/2). So, the change in y is √3/2 - 0 = √3/2. The change in x is 0.5 - 1 = -0.5. So, slope is (√3/2)/(-0.5) = -√3. That seems correct.For line DE: from D(-1, 0) to E(-0.5, -√3/2). Change in y is -√3/2 - 0 = -√3/2. Change in x is -0.5 - (-1) = 0.5. So, slope is (-√3/2)/0.5 = -√3. So, same slope. So, lines AB and DE are indeed parallel.But the problem says they are extended to meet at point Q. If they are parallel, they should never meet. That seems like a contradiction. Maybe I misread the problem?Wait, the problem says sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q. So, if AB and DE are extended, but they are parallel, they shouldn't meet. Maybe I have the labels wrong? Maybe it's not DE but another side?Wait, no, the problem says sides AB and DE. So, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the hexagon's structure.Wait, in a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are not opposite sides. Let me see: A to B is one side, and D to E is another side. Since the hexagon is regular, sides AB and DE are separated by two sides. So, maybe they are not parallel?Wait, but in my coordinate system, they are both slope -√3, so they are parallel. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to consider that when extended, they meet at a point outside the hexagon. But if they are parallel, they shouldn't meet. So, perhaps my coordinate system is not accurate?Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is opposite to ED, right? So, AB and ED are parallel. But DE is the same as ED, just the reverse direction. So, DE is the same line as ED but in the opposite direction. So, DE is also parallel to AB.Therefore, lines AB and DE are parallel, so they should never meet. But the problem says they are extended to meet at Q. So, perhaps I have an error in my reasoning.Wait, maybe I misassigned the coordinates. Let me think again.In a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees, and each side is equal. So, if I have a regular hexagon, the sides AB and DE are not directly opposite but are separated by some sides.Wait, maybe I should draw the hexagon to visualize better.Alternatively, perhaps the sides AB and DE are not parallel. Wait, in a regular hexagon, sides AB and ED are parallel, but DE is just the reverse of ED. So, DE is the same line as ED but in the opposite direction. So, DE is parallel to AB.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB beyond A and DE beyond E? Or maybe beyond B and beyond D?Wait, the problem says sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q. So, sides AB and DE are being extended beyond their endpoints.So, side AB goes from A to B, and if we extend it beyond B, and side DE goes from D to E, and if we extend it beyond E, will they meet?Wait, in my coordinate system, line AB extended beyond B would go towards negative y, and line DE extended beyond E would go towards negative y as well, but both have the same slope. So, they are parallel and should not meet.Alternatively, if we extend AB beyond A and DE beyond D, would they meet?Wait, let me check the equations again.Line AB: y = -√3 x + √3.Line DE: Let's see, points D(-1, 0) and E(-0.5, -√3/2). So, the equation of DE is y = -√3 x + c. Let's find c.Using point D(-1, 0):0 = -√3*(-1) + c => 0 = √3 + c => c = -√3.So, equation of DE is y = -√3 x - √3.So, line AB: y = -√3 x + √3.Line DE: y = -√3 x - √3.So, these are two parallel lines with slope -√3, but different y-intercepts. So, they are parallel and will never meet. Therefore, they cannot meet at a point Q. But the problem says they are extended to meet at Q. So, this is confusing.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates. Maybe the hexagon is not centered at the origin? Or perhaps I assigned the labels incorrectly.Wait, another way to think about it: in a regular hexagon, each side can be considered as vectors. So, perhaps AB and DE are not parallel? Wait, in a regular hexagon, sides AB and ED are parallel, but DE is the same as ED but in the opposite direction. So, DE is parallel to AB.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB beyond A and DE beyond E? Let me check.If I extend AB beyond A, which is at (1, 0), the line AB is y = -√3 x + √3. So, beyond A, it would go towards positive x-direction.Similarly, DE is the line y = -√3 x - √3. If I extend DE beyond E, which is at (-0.5, -√3/2), it would go towards negative x-direction.Wait, so if I extend AB beyond A and DE beyond E, they are going in opposite directions and will never meet. If I extend AB beyond B and DE beyond D, they are also going in opposite directions and will never meet.Wait, this is perplexing. The problem says they are extended to meet at Q, so they must meet somewhere. Maybe I have a misunderstanding of the hexagon's structure.Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is labeled differently. Maybe it's labeled in a different order? For example, sometimes hexagons are labeled in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner, but perhaps in this problem, it's labeled differently.Wait, the problem says \\"sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q.\\" So, sides AB and DE. So, AB is between A and B, and DE is between D and E. So, in the regular hexagon, these sides are not adjacent but separated by some vertices.Wait, maybe I should think about the hexagon in terms of vectors or using complex numbers to find the intersection point.Alternatively, perhaps using geometry without coordinates.In a regular hexagon, each side length is equal, say length 's'. The distance between opposite sides is 2 times the apothem. The apothem is the distance from the center to a side, which is (s * √3)/2.But since AB and DE are not opposite sides, their distance apart is different.Wait, maybe I can consider the hexagon as composed of equilateral triangles. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the hexagon's side.So, if I consider the center of the hexagon, O, then OA, OB, OC, etc., are all radii of the circumscribed circle, each equal to the side length 's'.Wait, perhaps I can use triangle properties to find angle Q.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of exterior angles.Wait, let me try another approach. Since AB and DE are sides of the hexagon, and they are extended to meet at Q, forming triangle QAB or something similar.Wait, perhaps I can consider the angles at the vertices and use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.Wait, let me think about the angles formed when AB and DE are extended.When AB is extended beyond B, it forms an external angle at B. Similarly, when DE is extended beyond E, it forms an external angle at E.In a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees, so the external angle is 60 degrees because 180 - 120 = 60.So, when AB is extended beyond B, the external angle at B is 60 degrees. Similarly, when DE is extended beyond E, the external angle at E is 60 degrees.Now, if I consider the lines AB extended beyond B and DE extended beyond E, they form two lines each making 60-degree angles with the sides BC and EF respectively.Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps me find angle Q.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the triangle formed by points Q, B, and E.Wait, let me think about the lines AB and DE. Since AB and DE are sides of the hexagon, and they are extended to meet at Q, perhaps triangle QAB and QDE are similar or something.Wait, maybe I should use the concept of similar triangles.Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of parallel lines and transversals.Wait, in the regular hexagon, sides AB and ED are parallel, as we established earlier. So, AB is parallel to ED, which is the same as DE but in the opposite direction.Wait, but if AB is parallel to ED, then AB and DE are not parallel because DE is just ED in the reverse direction. Wait, no, lines are defined by their direction, so DE is the same line as ED but in the opposite direction. So, if AB is parallel to ED, then AB is also parallel to DE because DE is just ED in reverse.Wait, so AB is parallel to DE, which means they cannot meet unless they are the same line, which they are not. So, this is confusing because the problem says they meet at Q.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in the other direction, not beyond B and E, but beyond A and D?Wait, let me check that.If I extend AB beyond A and DE beyond D, will they meet?In my coordinate system, line AB extended beyond A is y = -√3 x + √3, going towards positive x. Line DE extended beyond D is y = -√3 x - √3, going towards negative x. So, these lines are parallel and will never meet.Alternatively, if I extend AB beyond B and DE beyond E, they are both going towards negative y, but again, they are parallel and won't meet.Wait, maybe I need to consider that in a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are not parallel? But according to my coordinate system, they are.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates. Let me try a different approach.Let me consider the regular hexagon as being composed of six equilateral triangles, each with side length 's'. So, each triangle has angles of 60 degrees.In this case, the center of the hexagon is equidistant from all vertices, and each vertex is at a distance 's' from the center.Now, if I consider sides AB and DE, they are separated by two sides. So, the angle between AB and DE from the center is 120 degrees because each side corresponds to a 60-degree angle at the center, so two sides would be 120 degrees apart.Wait, maybe I can use the law of sines or cosines to find the distance between the lines AB and DE and then find the angle Q.Alternatively, perhaps using vectors.Wait, let me think about the vectors of AB and DE.In a regular hexagon, each side can be represented as a vector. Let me assign the center of the hexagon as the origin.So, vector OA is (s, 0), vector OB is (s/2, (s√3)/2), vector OC is (-s/2, (s√3)/2), vector OD is (-s, 0), vector OE is (-s/2, -(s√3)/2), and vector OF is (s/2, -(s√3)/2).So, vector AB is OB - OA = (s/2 - s, (s√3)/2 - 0) = (-s/2, (s√3)/2).Similarly, vector DE is OE - OD = (-s/2 - (-s), -(s√3)/2 - 0) = (s/2, -(s√3)/2).So, vector AB is (-s/2, (s√3)/2) and vector DE is (s/2, -(s√3)/2). So, vector DE is the negative of vector AB. So, DE = -AB.Therefore, lines AB and DE are parallel because their direction vectors are negatives of each other, meaning they are parallel but pointing in opposite directions.So, lines AB and DE are parallel and will never meet, which contradicts the problem statement that they meet at Q.Wait, this is perplexing. Maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in the same direction? But in that case, they are parallel and won't meet.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in different directions, not necessarily beyond their endpoints.Wait, the problem says \\"sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q.\\" So, sides AB and DE are being extended beyond their endpoints until they meet.But if AB and DE are parallel, they won't meet unless they are the same line, which they aren't. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the labels.Wait, maybe the sides are not AB and DE, but AB and DC or something else. But the problem clearly says AB and DE.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are not parallel? Wait, according to my calculations, they are parallel.Wait, maybe I should consider the hexagon in a different orientation. For example, if the hexagon is oriented such that one of its sides is horizontal, then AB and DE might not be parallel.Wait, in my coordinate system, AB is from (1,0) to (0.5, √3/2), which is a line going up and to the left. DE is from (-1,0) to (-0.5, -√3/2), which is a line going down and to the right. So, these lines are not parallel; they have different slopes.Wait, hold on, earlier I thought they had the same slope, but let me recalculate.Slope of AB: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (√3/2 - 0)/(0.5 - 1) = (√3/2)/(-0.5) = -√3.Slope of DE: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-√3/2 - 0)/(-0.5 - (-1)) = (-√3/2)/(0.5) = -√3.Wait, so both slopes are -√3, meaning they are parallel.But in my coordinate system, AB is going up and to the left, and DE is going down and to the right, but both have the same slope of -√3. So, they are parallel but in opposite directions.Wait, but if they are parallel, they shouldn't meet. So, the problem must have a different configuration.Wait, perhaps the hexagon is not regular? But the problem says it's a regular hexagon.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the hexagon is not convex? But regular hexagons are convex.Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the sides. Let me recount the sides:In a regular hexagon ABCDEF, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.So, sides AB and DE are separated by two sides: AB, BC, CD, DE. So, AB is the first side, DE is the fourth side.In a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are separated by two sides, so they are not opposite sides. Opposite sides would be AB and ED, right? Because in a hexagon, each side has an opposite side three apart.Wait, so AB is opposite to ED, BC is opposite to FE, and CD is opposite to AF.So, AB and ED are opposite sides, hence parallel. But DE is the same as ED in reverse, so DE is parallel to AB.Therefore, lines AB and DE are parallel, so they cannot meet unless they are the same line, which they aren't.Therefore, the problem must have a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the sides.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to sides AB and DC? Because DC is not parallel to AB.Wait, let me check the slope of DC.Point D is (-1, 0), point C is (-0.5, √3/2). So, slope of DC is (√3/2 - 0)/(-0.5 - (-1)) = (√3/2)/(0.5) = √3.So, slope of DC is √3, which is different from slope of AB (-√3). So, lines AB and DC are not parallel, so they would meet at some point.But the problem says sides AB and DE are extended to meet at Q. So, unless it's a typo, I have to assume it's AB and DE.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in the same direction, but that would still make them parallel.Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is labeled differently, such that DE is not the side from D to E, but from E to D? No, sides are defined by their endpoints in order.Wait, perhaps the hexagon is labeled in a different order, such as A, B, C, D, E, F going counterclockwise, but in my coordinate system, I assumed clockwise.Wait, let me try assigning the hexagon in a counterclockwise manner.So, point A: (1, 0)Point B: (0.5, -√3/2)Point C: (-0.5, -√3/2)Point D: (-1, 0)Point E: (-0.5, √3/2)Point F: (0.5, √3/2)So, now, side AB is from A(1,0) to B(0.5, -√3/2).Slope of AB: (-√3/2 - 0)/(0.5 - 1) = (-√3/2)/(-0.5) = √3.Similarly, side DE is from D(-1,0) to E(-0.5, √3/2).Slope of DE: (√3/2 - 0)/(-0.5 - (-1)) = (√3/2)/(0.5) = √3.So, in this counterclockwise labeling, both AB and DE have a slope of √3, so they are parallel.Wait, so regardless of the labeling direction, AB and DE are parallel.Therefore, the problem must have a different configuration or perhaps a typo.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DC to meet at Q? Because in my first coordinate system, AB and DC are not parallel and would meet.But the problem says AB and DE.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB and FE? Because FE is another side.Wait, let me check the slope of FE.Point F: (0.5, √3/2), point E: (-0.5, √3/2). So, slope of FE is (√3/2 - √3/2)/(-0.5 - 0.5) = 0/(-1) = 0. So, FE is a horizontal line.Slope of AB is -√3, so they are not parallel and would meet.But the problem says AB and DE.Wait, perhaps I need to accept that in the problem, AB and DE are not parallel and can meet at Q, so maybe my coordinate system is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is not regular? But the problem says it's a regular hexagon.Wait, maybe I need to use a different approach without coordinates.Let me consider the regular hexagon and the extensions of AB and DE.In a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. So, at each vertex, the angle is 120 degrees.When we extend side AB beyond B, it forms an external angle of 60 degrees at vertex B.Similarly, when we extend side DE beyond E, it forms an external angle of 60 degrees at vertex E.Now, if I consider the lines AB extended beyond B and DE extended beyond E, they form two lines each making 60-degree angles with the sides BC and EF respectively.Wait, perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by these two extended lines and find angle Q.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of alternate interior angles.Wait, since AB and DE are sides of the hexagon, and in a regular hexagon, the sides are spaced 60 degrees apart in terms of their angles from the center.Wait, each side corresponds to a 60-degree angle at the center.So, the angle between AB and DE from the center is 120 degrees because they are two sides apart.Wait, so if I consider the center O, then angle AOE is 240 degrees because each side is 60 degrees apart, so from A to E is four sides, which is 240 degrees.Wait, no, from A to B is 60 degrees, A to C is 120, A to D is 180, A to E is 240, and A to F is 300 degrees.So, angle AOE is 240 degrees.Wait, but how does this help me find angle Q?Alternatively, perhaps considering the triangle formed by points Q, B, and E.Wait, if I can find the lengths of QB and QE, and the angle between them, I can use the law of cosines to find angle Q.But I don't have the lengths.Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles.Wait, perhaps the triangles formed by the extensions are similar.Wait, when AB is extended beyond B, it forms an external angle of 60 degrees, and similarly for DE.So, maybe the triangle formed by Q, B, and E has angles related to 60 degrees.Wait, let me try to think about the angles at Q.When AB is extended beyond B, the external angle is 60 degrees, so the angle between AB extended and BC is 60 degrees.Similarly, when DE is extended beyond E, the external angle is 60 degrees, so the angle between DE extended and EF is 60 degrees.Now, if I consider the lines AB extended and DE extended meeting at Q, then angle Q is formed by these two extended lines.So, perhaps angle Q is related to these 60-degree angles.Wait, maybe angle Q is 60 degrees because it's formed by two lines each making 60-degree angles with the sides.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps angle Q is 120 degrees because it's supplementary to the 60-degree angles.Wait, let me try to visualize this.If I have two lines intersecting at Q, each making a 60-degree angle with their respective sides, then the angle between these two lines at Q would be the sum of these two 60-degree angles, which is 120 degrees.Wait, that might make sense.So, angle Q is 120 degrees.But I need to verify this.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around point Q is 360 degrees.If I can find the other angles around Q, I can subtract them to find angle Q.But without more information, it's difficult.Wait, maybe I can consider the triangle formed by Q, B, and E.In this triangle, angles at B and E are each 60 degrees because they are external angles of the hexagon.So, in triangle QBE, angles at B and E are 60 degrees each.Therefore, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so angle Q would be 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought.Wait, no, because in triangle QBE, angles at B and E are not necessarily 60 degrees.Wait, the external angles at B and E are 60 degrees, but the angles in triangle QBE at B and E might be different.Wait, perhaps I need to consider the angles more carefully.When AB is extended beyond B, the external angle at B is 60 degrees, which is the angle between AB extended and BC.Similarly, when DE is extended beyond E, the external angle at E is 60 degrees, which is the angle between DE extended and EF.So, in triangle QBE, the angles at B and E are not the external angles but the angles between QB and BE, and QE and BE.Wait, perhaps I need to use the concept of alternate interior angles.Wait, since AB and DE are parallel, and BE is a transversal, the corresponding angles would be equal.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles.Wait, perhaps triangles QAB and QDE are similar.But without knowing the lengths, it's hard to say.Wait, maybe I can use the properties of the regular hexagon to find the lengths.In a regular hexagon with side length 's', the distance between two non-adjacent sides can be calculated.But since AB and DE are parallel, the distance between them is constant.Wait, but if they are parallel, they don't meet, so angle Q doesn't exist. So, perhaps the problem is referring to a different configuration.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in different directions, not necessarily beyond their endpoints.Wait, the problem says \\"sides AB and DE are extended to meet at point Q.\\" So, sides AB and DE are extended beyond their endpoints until they meet.But if they are parallel, they won't meet. So, perhaps the problem is referring to a different pair of sides.Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it should be AB and DC or AB and EF.Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is not regular, but the problem says it's regular.Wait, maybe I need to consider that in a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are not parallel. Wait, according to my coordinate system, they are parallel.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in a regular hexagon, sides AB and DE are not parallel because they are separated by two sides, but in reality, in a regular hexagon, sides separated by two sides are parallel.Wait, in a regular hexagon, sides AB and ED are parallel, and sides AB and DE are not parallel because DE is the same as ED in reverse.Wait, no, lines are defined by their direction, so DE is the same as ED but in reverse direction, so they are still parallel.Therefore, lines AB and DE are parallel and cannot meet.Therefore, the problem must have a typo or I'm misinterpreting the sides.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in the same direction, but that would still make them parallel.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to extending AB and DE in different directions, such as AB extended beyond A and DE extended beyond E.But in that case, they are going in opposite directions and won't meet.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to extending AB and DE towards each other, but in my coordinate system, they are parallel and won't meet.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the hexagon is not regular, but the problem says it's regular.Wait, perhaps I need to accept that angle Q is 60 degrees because it's formed by two lines each making 60-degree angles with the sides.But earlier, I thought it might be 120 degrees.Wait, let me try to think differently.If I consider the external angles at B and E, each is 60 degrees.When AB is extended beyond B, it forms a 60-degree angle with BC.Similarly, when DE is extended beyond E, it forms a 60-degree angle with EF.Now, if I consider the lines AB extended and DE extended, they form two lines each making 60-degree angles with BC and EF respectively.Since BC and EF are themselves separated by some angle, perhaps the angle between AB extended and DE extended can be found.Wait, in a regular hexagon, BC and EF are separated by 120 degrees because each side corresponds to 60 degrees at the center.So, the angle between BC and EF is 120 degrees.Now, if AB extended makes a 60-degree angle with BC, and DE extended makes a 60-degree angle with EF, then the angle between AB extended and DE extended would be 120 - 60 - 60 = 0 degrees, which doesn't make sense.Wait, perhaps it's 120 + 60 + 60 = 240 degrees, but that's the reflex angle.Wait, maybe I need to consider the angle between AB extended and DE extended as 60 + 60 = 120 degrees.Wait, that seems plausible.So, angle Q is 120 degrees.Therefore, the degree measure of angle Q is 120 degrees.I think that's the answer."},{"question":"The area of the floor in a square room is 400 square feet.

And I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers in the denominator, it's often helpful to rationalize the denominator. That means getting rid of the imaginary unit 'i' in the denominator. I think the way to do that is by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of (i - 1) should be (-i - 1), right? Wait, no, actually, the complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary part. So if the denominator is (i - 1), its conjugate would be (-i - 1). Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.Wait, actually, the complex conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So in this case, the denominator is (-1 + i), so its conjugate should be (-1 - i). Yeah, that makes sense. So I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by (-1 - i).So, z equals 1 divided by (i - 1). Let me write that as z = 1 / (i - 1). To rationalize, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 - i):z = [1 * (-1 - i)] / [(i - 1)(-1 - i)]Now, let's compute the denominator first. Multiplying (i - 1) by (-1 - i):(i - 1)(-1 - i) = i*(-1) + i*(-i) -1*(-1) -1*(-i)= -i - i^2 + 1 + iWait, let's compute that step by step:First term: i*(-1) = -iSecond term: i*(-i) = -i^2Third term: -1*(-1) = 1Fourth term: -1*(-i) = iSo combining these:- i - i^2 + 1 + iNow, I know that i^2 is equal to -1, so -i^2 is -(-1) = 1.So substituting that in:- i + 1 + 1 + iNow, let's combine like terms:- i + i = 01 + 1 = 2So the denominator simplifies to 2.Now, the numerator was (-1 - i). So putting it all together:z = (-1 - i) / 2Which can be written as:z = (-1/2) - (i/2)So, z equals -1/2 minus (1/2)i.Now, let's look at the options:A: The real part of z is 1/2.Hmm, the real part of z is -1/2, not 1/2. So A is incorrect.B: The imaginary part of z is -1/2 i.Wait, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is -1/2. But in the option, it's written as -1/2 i. Is that correct? Well, sometimes people write the imaginary part including the i, but technically, the imaginary part is just the scalar coefficient. So if we consider the imaginary part as a real number, it's -1/2, not -1/2 i. So I think B is also incorrect because it includes the i, which isn't standard.C: |z| equals sqrt(2)/2.Okay, let's compute the modulus of z. The modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So for z = -1/2 - (1/2)i, the modulus is sqrt[ (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ].Calculating that:(-1/2)^2 = 1/4So, sqrt(1/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(2/4) = sqrt(1/2) = (sqrt(2))/2.Yes, that's correct. So C is correct.D: The conjugate of z is 1/2 + 1/2 i.The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So for z = -1/2 - (1/2)i, the conjugate should be -1/2 + (1/2)i. But option D says 1/2 + 1/2 i, which is different. So D is incorrect.Therefore, the correct option is C.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through the steps again.Starting with z = 1 / (i - 1). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 - i):Numerator: 1 * (-1 - i) = -1 - iDenominator: (i - 1)(-1 - i) = i*(-1) + i*(-i) -1*(-1) -1*(-i) = -i - i^2 + 1 + iSimplify: -i - (-1) + 1 + i = -i + 1 + 1 + i = 2So z = (-1 - i)/2 = -1/2 - (1/2)i. That seems correct.Modulus: sqrt[ (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ] = sqrt(1/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(1/2) = sqrt(2)/2. Correct.Conjugate: -1/2 + (1/2)i, which is not what D says. So D is wrong.So yes, C is the correct answer."},{"question":" n  symbols line up in a row, numbered as  1,2,...,n  from left to right. Delete every symbol with squared numbers. Renumber the rest from left to right. Repeat the process until all  n  symbols are deleted. Let  f(n)  be the initial number of the last symbol deleted. Find  f(n)  in terms of  n  and find  f(2019) .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are n symbols lined up in a row, numbered from 1 to n. The task is to delete every symbol whose position is a perfect square, then renumber the remaining symbols from left to right. We repeat this process until all symbols are deleted. The function f(n) represents the initial number of the last symbol that gets deleted. I need to find f(n) in terms of n and specifically find f(2019).Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand what happens in each step of the deletion process. So, initially, we have symbols numbered 1 through n. In the first pass, we delete all symbols whose positions are perfect squares. That means we remove symbols at positions 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to n.After deleting these symbols, we renumber the remaining symbols from 1 to whatever is left. Then, we repeat the process: delete all symbols at perfect square positions, renumber, and so on until nothing is left.The key here is to figure out the order in which symbols get deleted and, specifically, which one is the last one to be deleted. The function f(n) gives the initial number of that last symbol.Let me try to work through a small example to get a better understanding. Let's say n = 5.1. First pass: Delete perfect squares. So, delete 1 and 4. Remaining symbols are 2, 3, 5. They are now renumbered as 1, 2, 3.2. Second pass: Delete perfect squares. So, delete 1 (which was originally 2) and 4 (but we only have up to 3 now, so only delete 1). Remaining symbols are 2, 3 (originally 3 and 5). Renumbered as 1, 2.3. Third pass: Delete perfect squares. Delete 1 (originally 3). Remaining symbol is 2 (originally 5). Renumbered as 1.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Now all symbols are deleted.So, the order of deletion is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5. Therefore, the last symbol deleted is 5, so f(5) = 5.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check another example to see if I can spot a pattern.Let's take n = 6.1. First pass: Delete 1, 4. Remaining: 2, 3, 5, 6. Renumbered as 1, 2, 3, 4.2. Second pass: Delete 1, 4. So delete 1 (originally 2) and 4 (originally 6). Remaining: 3, 5. Renumbered as 1, 2.3. Third pass: Delete 1 (originally 3). Remaining: 2 (originally 5). Renumbered as 1.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Now all symbols are deleted.Order of deletion: 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5. So the last symbol deleted is 5, so f(6) = 5.Wait, that's interesting. For n=5 and n=6, f(n)=5. Let me try n=7.1. First pass: Delete 1, 4. Remaining: 2,3,5,6,7. Renumbered as 1,2,3,4,5.2. Second pass: Delete 1,4. So delete 1 (originally 2) and 4 (originally 6). Remaining: 3,5,7. Renumbered as 1,2,3.3. Third pass: Delete 1 (originally 3). Remaining: 2,3 (originally 5,7). Renumbered as 1,2.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Remaining: 2 (originally 7). Renumbered as 1.5. Fifth pass: Delete 1 (originally 7). All symbols deleted.Order of deletion: 1,4,2,6,3,5,7. So f(7)=7.Hmm, so f(5)=5, f(6)=5, f(7)=7. It seems like f(n) is sometimes equal to n, but not always. Let me try n=8.1. First pass: Delete 1,4. Remaining:2,3,5,6,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4,5,6.2. Second pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 2) and 4 (originally 6). Remaining:3,5,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4.3. Third pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 3) and 4 (originally 8). Remaining:5,7. Renumbered as1,2.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Remaining:2 (originally 7). Renumbered as1.5. Fifth pass: Delete 1 (originally 7). All symbols deleted.Order of deletion:1,4,2,6,3,8,5,7. So f(8)=7.Wait, so for n=8, f(n)=7. So it's not always n. Let me try n=9.1. First pass: Delete 1,4,9. Remaining:2,3,5,6,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4,5,6.2. Second pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 2) and 4 (originally 6). Remaining:3,5,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4.3. Third pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 3) and 4 (originally 8). Remaining:5,7. Renumbered as1,2.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Remaining:2 (originally 7). Renumbered as1.5. Fifth pass: Delete 1 (originally 7). All symbols deleted.Order of deletion:1,4,9,2,6,3,8,5,7. So f(9)=7.Wait, so f(9)=7 as well. Hmm, interesting. So for n=7,8,9, f(n)=7.Let me try n=10.1. First pass: Delete 1,4,9. Remaining:2,3,5,6,7,8,10. Renumbered as1,2,3,4,5,6,7.2. Second pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 2) and 4 (originally 6). Remaining:3,5,7,8,10. Renumbered as1,2,3,4,5.3. Third pass: Delete 1,4. Delete 1 (originally 3) and 4 (originally 8). Remaining:5,7,10. Renumbered as1,2,3.4. Fourth pass: Delete 1 (originally 5). Remaining:2,3 (originally 7,10). Renumbered as1,2.5. Fifth pass: Delete 1 (originally 7). Remaining:2 (originally 10). Renumbered as1.6. Sixth pass: Delete 1 (originally 10). All symbols deleted.Order of deletion:1,4,9,2,6,3,8,5,7,10. So f(10)=10.Wait, so f(10)=10. So it seems like when n is a perfect square, f(n) is n, but when it's not, it's sometimes less.Wait, but for n=5,6,7,8,9,10, f(n) is 5,5,7,7,7,10. So it's not straightforward.Maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the process.Each time we delete the perfect squares, we're effectively removing every k^2-th symbol. After each deletion, the remaining symbols are renumbered, so the positions shift. The last symbol to be deleted would be the one that survives the longest number of passes.Perhaps, instead of tracking the order of deletion, I can model the position of the last remaining symbol through each pass.Let me denote the initial position as x. After each deletion pass, the position of the symbol changes. I need to find a way to express the new position in terms of the old position.Suppose after the first pass, the number of symbols remaining is m = n - floor(sqrt(n)). The positions of the remaining symbols are shifted because the perfect squares have been removed.Wait, maybe it's better to think recursively. Let me define f(n) as the initial position of the last symbol deleted when starting with n symbols.In the first pass, we delete all perfect squares. The number of symbols deleted is floor(sqrt(n)). So, the number of symbols remaining is n - floor(sqrt(n)).But the positions of the remaining symbols are now renumbered. So, the symbol that was originally at position k, where k is not a perfect square, is now at position k - floor(sqrt(k)).Wait, perhaps not exactly. Because when you delete the perfect squares, the symbols after each perfect square shift left by one. So, for example, if you delete position 1, then position 2 becomes 1, position 3 becomes 2, etc., until the next perfect square.This seems complicated. Maybe I can model the position after each pass.Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for f(n) based on the largest perfect square less than or equal to n.Let me denote a_n = floor(sqrt(n)). So, a_n is the largest integer such that a_n^2 <= n.Then, the number of symbols deleted in the first pass is a_n. So, the number of symbols remaining is n - a_n.But the positions of the remaining symbols are now renumbered. So, the symbol that was originally at position k, where k is not a perfect square, is now at position k - floor(sqrt(k)).Wait, but this might not be straightforward because the deletion of perfect squares affects the numbering.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the process as similar to the Josephus problem, where people are standing in a circle and every k-th person is eliminated. However, in this case, it's a linear process with perfect squares being eliminated each pass.Wait, maybe I can find a recursive formula for f(n). Let me think.After the first pass, we have m = n - a_n symbols left. The last symbol to be deleted in the original problem corresponds to the last symbol in this reduced problem. But the numbering has changed.Wait, perhaps f(n) = f(n - a_n) + a_n, but adjusted for the fact that some positions have been shifted.Wait, no, because when you delete the perfect squares, the remaining symbols are renumbered, so the position of the last symbol in the next pass is not directly additive.Alternatively, perhaps f(n) = f(n - a_n) + a_n, but only if the last symbol is not in the deleted positions.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for a pattern.From my earlier examples:n | f(n)---|---1 | 12 | 23 | 34 | 45 | 56 | 57 | 78 | 79 | 710|10Hmm, so for n=1 to 4, f(n)=n. For n=5,6, f(n)=5. For n=7,8,9, f(n)=7. For n=10, f(n)=10.So, it seems that f(n) increases by 2 each time n reaches the next odd square? Wait, 5 is not a square, but 7 is not a square either. Wait, 5 is 2^2 +1, 7 is 2^2 + 3, 10 is 3^2 +1.Wait, maybe f(n) is related to the largest perfect square less than or equal to n, plus some offset.Let me denote a_n = floor(sqrt(n)). Then, n = a_n^2 + b_n, where 0 <= b_n < 2a_n +1.Wait, that's from the theory of squares. The difference between consecutive squares is 2a_n +1.So, if n = a_n^2 + b_n, then b_n = n - a_n^2.So, depending on the value of b_n, f(n) can be determined.Looking back at the examples:For n=5, a_n=2, b_n=1. So, b_n <= a_n, so f(n)=a_n^2 +1=5.For n=6, a_n=2, b_n=2. Still b_n <= a_n, so f(n)=5.For n=7, a_n=2, b_n=3. Now, b_n > a_n, so f(n)=a_n^2 + a_n +1=7.Similarly, for n=8, a_n=2, b_n=4. Still b_n > a_n, so f(n)=7.For n=9, a_n=3, b_n=0. So, b_n <= a_n, so f(n)=a_n^2 +1=10? Wait, but f(9)=7 in my earlier example. Hmm, that contradicts.Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check n=9 again.Wait, for n=9, the process was:1. Delete 1,4,9. Remaining:2,3,5,6,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4,5,6.2. Delete 1,4. Delete 2 and 6. Remaining:3,5,7,8. Renumbered as1,2,3,4.3. Delete 1,4. Delete 3 and 8. Remaining:5,7. Renumbered as1,2.4. Delete 1. Delete 5. Remaining:7. Renumbered as1.5. Delete 1. Delete 7. All symbols deleted.So, the last symbol deleted is 7, which is f(9)=7.But according to the formula I was thinking, a_n=3, b_n=0, so f(n)=a_n^2 +1=10, which is incorrect. So, my initial formula is wrong.Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.Perhaps f(n) is equal to a_n^2 +1 if b_n <= a_n, and a_n^2 + a_n +1 if b_n > a_n.Wait, let's test this.For n=5, a_n=2, b_n=1. Since 1 <=2, f(n)=2^2 +1=5. Correct.For n=6, a_n=2, b_n=2. Since 2 <=2, f(n)=5. Correct.For n=7, a_n=2, b_n=3. Since 3 >2, f(n)=2^2 +2 +1=7. Correct.For n=8, a_n=2, b_n=4. Since 4 >2, f(n)=7. Correct.For n=9, a_n=3, b_n=0. Since 0 <=3, f(n)=3^2 +1=10. But in reality, f(9)=7. So, this formula doesn't hold for n=9.Wait, maybe the formula is different when b_n=0. Because when b_n=0, n is a perfect square, so in the first pass, we delete n itself, so the last symbol deleted would be n. But in my earlier example, n=9, the last symbol deleted was 7, not 9. Wait, that contradicts.Wait, no, in n=9, we delete 1,4,9 in the first pass. So, 9 is deleted first, not last. So, f(9)=7, which is the last symbol deleted, not 9.So, when n is a perfect square, the last symbol deleted is not n, but something else. So, my initial thought was wrong.Wait, so maybe the formula is:If n is not a perfect square, then f(n) = a_n^2 +1 if b_n <= a_n, else a_n^2 + a_n +1.But when n is a perfect square, f(n) = f(n-1). Because in the first pass, n is deleted, so the last symbol deleted would be the same as f(n-1).Wait, let's test this.For n=4, which is a perfect square, f(4)=4.

Hmm, okay. I remember that Chebyshev polynomials have some recurrence relation, right? Let me try to recall.I think the recurrence relation for Chebyshev polynomials is ( T_{n+1}(x) = 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x) ). Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, maybe I can use this recurrence to prove the form of ( T_n(x) ). First, I should check the base cases to make sure the formula holds for small values of ( n ). Let's see, what is ( T_0(x) )? I believe it's 1. Plugging ( n = 0 ) into the formula, we get ( 2^{-1}x^0 + a_1x^{-1} + ldots ). Wait, that doesn't make sense because ( x^{-1} ) isn't a polynomial term. Maybe the formula starts from ( n = 1 )? Let me check ( T_1(x) ). It's just ( x ), right? So, plugging ( n = 1 ) into the formula, we get ( 2^{0}x^1 + a_1x^0 ), which simplifies to ( x + a_1 ). But ( T_1(x) = x ), so ( a_1 ) must be 0. Okay, that works.Now, let's assume that the formula holds for ( T_n(x) ) and ( T_{n-1}(x) ). That is, assume:[T_n(x) = 2^{n-1}x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + ldots + a_n]and[T_{n-1}(x) = 2^{n-2}x^{n-1} + b_1x^{n-2} + ldots + b_{n-1}]where all ( a_i ) and ( b_j ) are integers.Using the recurrence relation:[T_{n+1}(x) = 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x)]Substituting the assumed forms:[T_{n+1}(x) = 2xleft(2^{n-1}x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + ldots + a_nright) - left(2^{n-2}x^{n-1} + b_1x^{n-2} + ldots + b_{n-1}right)]Let's expand this:[T_{n+1}(x) = 2^{n}x^{n+1} + 2a_1x^n + 2a_2x^{n-1} + ldots + 2a_nx - 2^{n-2}x^{n-1} - b_1x^{n-2} - ldots - b_{n-1}]Now, let's combine like terms. The leading term is ( 2^{n}x^{n+1} ), which matches the expected form. The next term is ( 2a_1x^n ). Since ( T_{n+1}(x) ) should have a coefficient ( 2^{(n+1)-1} = 2^n ) for ( x^{n+1} ), which we already have. For the ( x^n ) term, we have ( 2a_1x^n ). But in the assumed form, the coefficient for ( x^n ) should be an integer. Since ( a_1 ) is an integer, ( 2a_1 ) is also an integer. Similarly, for the ( x^{n-1} ) term, we have ( 2a_2x^{n-1} - 2^{n-2}x^{n-1} ). Again, both ( 2a_2 ) and ( 2^{n-2} ) are integers, so their difference is also an integer.Continuing this way, all the coefficients for the lower-degree terms will be integers because they are combinations of integers multiplied by 2 or subtracted. Therefore, by induction, if the formula holds for ( T_n(x) ) and ( T_{n-1}(x) ), it will hold for ( T_{n+1}(x) ).Since we've verified the base cases and the inductive step, the formula holds for all ( n geq 1 ). Thus, ( T_n(x) ) has the form ( 2^{n-1}x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + ldots + a_n ) with integer coefficients ( a_1, ldots, a_n ).Wait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. I assumed the form for ( T_n(x) ) and ( T_{n-1}(x) ), used the recurrence, and showed that ( T_{n+1}(x) ) also has the same form with integer coefficients. The base cases ( n = 0 ) and ( n = 1 ) seem to hold, although ( n = 0 ) was a bit tricky because of the negative exponent, but since ( T_0(x) = 1 ), it effectively has no ( x ) terms, so the formula still works if we consider ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) to be zero for the missing terms.Yeah, I think that covers it. So, by mathematical induction, the proof should be complete."},{"question":" textbf{Problem 4.}  The number of perfect inhabitants of a city was a perfect square, in other words, a whole number squared. with  100  people plus the new number of inhabitants turned out to be a perfect square plus one. Now, with another increase of  100  people, the number of inhabitants is again a perfect square. What was the number of inhabitants original city?","answer":"Let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the original number of inhabitants is a perfect square, which means it can be written as ( n^2 ) where ( n ) is an integer. When 100 people are added, the population becomes ( n^2 + 100 ). According to the problem, this new number is one more than another perfect square. Let me denote this new perfect square as ( m^2 ). So, we have the equation:[n^2 + 100 = m^2 + 1]If I rearrange this equation, it becomes:[n^2 + 99 = m^2]This tells me that the difference between ( m^2 ) and ( n^2 ) is 99. Now, another 100 people are added, making the total population ( n^2 + 200 ). This is also a perfect square, which I'll denote as ( k^2 ). So, we have another equation:[n^2 + 200 = k^2]Now, I have two equations:1. ( m^2 = n^2 + 99 )2. ( k^2 = n^2 + 200 )If I subtract the first equation from the second, I get:[k^2 - m^2 = (n^2 + 200) - (n^2 + 99)][k^2 - m^2 = 101]I remember that ( k^2 - m^2 ) can be factored as ( (k - m)(k + m) ). So,[(k - m)(k + m) = 101]Since 101 is a prime number, the only factor pairs are (1, 101) and (-1, -101). I'll consider the positive pair because population can't be negative.So,[k - m = 1][k + m = 101]Now, I can solve these two equations. Adding them together:[(k - m) + (k + m) = 1 + 101][2k = 102][k = 51]Subtracting the first equation from the second:[(k + m) - (k - m) = 101 - 1][2m = 100][m = 50]Now that I have ( m = 50 ), I can substitute back into the equation ( m^2 = n^2 + 99 ):[50^2 = n^2 + 99][2500 = n^2 + 99][n^2 = 2500 - 99][n^2 = 2401][n = 49]So, the original number of inhabitants was ( 49^2 ), which is 2401.**Final Answer**The original number of inhabitants was boxed{2401}."},{"question":"Minsu distributed 240 marbles by putting every 35 marbles in 4 large boxes and putting every 6 marbles in 3 small boxes.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the functions are given as f(x) = -x² + a x + 4 and g(x) = |x + 1| + |x - 1|. There are two parts to the problem. Starting with part (1): When a = 1, find the solution set of the inequality f(x) ≥ g(x). Alright, so when a is 1, f(x) becomes -x² + x + 4. I need to find where this is greater than or equal to g(x). Let me first understand what g(x) is. It's the sum of two absolute value functions: |x + 1| and |x - 1|. I remember that absolute value functions can be broken down into different cases depending on the value of x. So, I should probably consider different intervals for x where the expressions inside the absolute values change their signs.The expressions inside the absolute values are x + 1 and x - 1. These will change signs at x = -1 and x = 1, respectively. So, I can split the real line into three intervals:1. x < -12. -1 ≤ x ≤ 13. x > 1In each interval, I can simplify g(x) without the absolute value signs.Let's do that:1. For x < -1:   - x + 1 is negative, so |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x -1   - x - 1 is also negative, so |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x +1   Therefore, g(x) = (-x -1) + (-x +1) = -2x2. For -1 ≤ x ≤ 1:   - x + 1 is non-negative, so |x + 1| = x + 1   - x - 1 is non-positive, so |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x +1   Therefore, g(x) = (x + 1) + (-x +1) = 23. For x > 1:   - x + 1 is positive, so |x + 1| = x + 1   - x - 1 is positive, so |x - 1| = x - 1   Therefore, g(x) = (x + 1) + (x - 1) = 2xSo, g(x) is a piecewise function:- g(x) = -2x when x < -1- g(x) = 2 when -1 ≤ x ≤ 1- g(x) = 2x when x > 1Now, I need to solve f(x) ≥ g(x) in each of these intervals.Starting with the first interval: x < -1Here, g(x) = -2x, so the inequality becomes:-x² + x + 4 ≥ -2xLet me bring all terms to one side:-x² + x + 4 + 2x ≥ 0Simplify:-x² + 3x + 4 ≥ 0Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):x² - 3x - 4 ≤ 0Now, solve the quadratic inequality x² - 3x - 4 ≤ 0.First, find the roots of x² - 3x - 4 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:x = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 16)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(25)] / 2 = [3 ± 5]/2So, x = (3 + 5)/2 = 8/2 = 4And x = (3 - 5)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1So, the quadratic can be factored as (x - 4)(x + 1) ≤ 0.The critical points are x = -1 and x = 4. The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of x² is positive), so it will be ≤ 0 between the roots.Thus, the solution is -1 ≤ x ≤ 4.But wait, in this interval, we are considering x < -1. So, the overlap between x < -1 and -1 ≤ x ≤ 4 is just x = -1. But since x < -1, there is no solution in this interval.So, no solutions in x < -1.Moving on to the second interval: -1 ≤ x ≤ 1Here, g(x) = 2, so the inequality becomes:-x² + x + 4 ≥ 2Subtract 2 from both sides:-x² + x + 2 ≥ 0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):x² - x - 2 ≤ 0Factor the quadratic:Looking for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1. Those are -2 and 1.So, (x - 2)(x + 1) ≤ 0Critical points at x = -1 and x = 2. The quadratic opens upwards, so it's ≤ 0 between the roots.Thus, the solution is -1 ≤ x ≤ 2.But in this interval, we are considering -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, the overlap is -1 ≤ x ≤ 1.Therefore, in this interval, the solution is -1 ≤ x ≤ 1.Now, moving to the third interval: x > 1Here, g(x) = 2x, so the inequality becomes:-x² + x + 4 ≥ 2xBring all terms to one side:-x² + x + 4 - 2x ≥ 0Simplify:-x² - x + 4 ≥ 0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):x² + x - 4 ≤ 0Solve the quadratic inequality x² + x - 4 ≤ 0.Find the roots using quadratic formula:x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 16)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(17)] / 2So, the roots are x = [-1 + sqrt(17)] / 2 and x = [-1 - sqrt(17)] / 2.Since sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123, the positive root is approximately ( -1 + 4.123 ) / 2 ≈ 1.5615, and the negative root is approximately ( -1 - 4.123 ) / 2 ≈ -2.5615.So, the quadratic x² + x - 4 ≤ 0 is satisfied between its roots: [-2.5615, 1.5615].But in this interval, we are considering x > 1. So, the overlap is 1 < x ≤ 1.5615.Calculating the exact value, since sqrt(17) is irrational, we can write it as x ≤ [ -1 + sqrt(17) ] / 2.So, the solution in this interval is 1 < x ≤ [ -1 + sqrt(17) ] / 2.Now, combining all the solutions from the three intervals:- From x < -1: no solution- From -1 ≤ x ≤ 1: solution is -1 ≤ x ≤ 1- From x > 1: solution is 1 < x ≤ [ -1 + sqrt(17) ] / 2So, overall, the solution set is from -1 to [ -1 + sqrt(17) ] / 2.Therefore, the solution set is x ∈ [ -1, ( -1 + sqrt(17) ) / 2 ].Moving on to part (2): If the solution set of the inequality f(x) ≥ g(x) contains [-1,1], find the range of values for a.So, we need that for all x in [-1,1], f(x) ≥ g(x). First, note that in the interval [-1,1], g(x) is equal to 2, as we saw earlier.Therefore, for x ∈ [-1,1], the inequality f(x) ≥ 2 must hold.So, f(x) = -x² + a x + 4 ≥ 2 for all x ∈ [-1,1].Let me rewrite this inequality:-x² + a x + 4 ≥ 2Subtract 2 from both sides:-x² + a x + 2 ≥ 0So, we need -x² + a x + 2 ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [-1,1].Let me denote h(x) = -x² + a x + 2. We need h(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [-1,1].So, h(x) is a quadratic function in x. Since the coefficient of x² is negative, it's a downward opening parabola.To ensure that h(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [-1,1], the minimum value of h(x) on this interval must be ≥ 0.But since it's a downward opening parabola, the minimum occurs at the endpoints of the interval.Therefore, we need to check the values of h(x) at x = -1 and x = 1.So, compute h(-1) and h(1):h(-1) = -(-1)^2 + a*(-1) + 2 = -1 - a + 2 = 1 - ah(1) = -(1)^2 + a*(1) + 2 = -1 + a + 2 = 1 + aWe need both h(-1) ≥ 0 and h(1) ≥ 0.So,1 - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 1and1 + a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ -1Therefore, combining these two inequalities, we get -1 ≤ a ≤ 1.Hence, the range of values for a is [-1,1].I think that's it. Let me just double-check.For part (1), when a=1, we found the solution set is from -1 to (sqrt(17)-1)/2, which is approximately 1.5615. That seems correct.For part (2), ensuring that f(x) ≥ g(x) on [-1,1] requires that f(x) ≥ 2 on that interval. We checked the endpoints and found that a must be between -1 and 1. That makes sense because if a is too large or too small, the quadratic might dip below 2 somewhere in the interval.Yeah, I think that's solid.**Final Answer**(1) The solution set is boxed{left[-1, dfrac{-1 + sqrt{17}}{2}right]}.(2) The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{[-1, 1]}."},{"question":"Jon’s textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon’s textbooks.

Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.Sarah leaves her house and walks north to the park. Initially, she walks through a residential area at a moderate pace. Then, upon reaching the main road, she speeds up. After arriving at the park, she spends 30 minutes bird watching. She returns home via the same route, stopping briefly at a café on the main road to grab a coffee before walking through the residential area at her usual moderate pace.Each graph presents the distance from Sarah's home vertically against the time elapsed since departing home horizontally. So, the y-axis is distance from home, and the x-axis is time.The options are:A. The graph displays a constant steep slope without any breaks.B. The graph illustrates two periods of constant distance (birdwatching and coffee) with varying slopes for walking pace.C. The graph shows no periods of constant distance and has an inconsistent return trip.D. The graph is just a straight line indicating steady movement without stops.Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, when Sarah leaves her house, she walks through a residential area at a moderate pace. So, initially, her distance from home increases at a moderate rate. This should be represented by a line with a moderate slope on the graph.Then, she reaches the main road and speeds up. So, her walking pace increases, meaning the slope of the graph should become steeper because she's covering more distance in less time.After arriving at the park, she spends 30 minutes bird watching. During this time, her distance from home doesn't change because she's stationary. This should be represented by a horizontal line on the graph, indicating no change in distance over time.Next, she returns home via the same route. So, her distance from home should start to decrease. However, on her way back, she stops briefly at a café on the main road to grab a coffee. This means there's another period where her distance from home doesn't change, so another horizontal line on the graph.Finally, she continues walking through the residential area at her usual moderate pace, so the slope of the graph should decrease back to the moderate rate as she approaches home.Putting this all together, the graph should show:1. A moderate slope increasing (walking through residential area).2. A steeper slope increasing (speeding up on the main road).3. A horizontal line (bird watching at the park).4. A steeper slope decreasing (returning on the main road).5. A horizontal line (stopping at the café).6. A moderate slope decreasing (walking back through the residential area).Now, let's look at the options again.Option A: Constant steep slope without any breaks. This doesn't fit because Sarah's pace changes, and she stops twice, so there should be breaks in the slope and periods of constant distance.Option B: Two periods of constant distance (birdwatching and coffee) with varying slopes for walking pace. This seems to fit because there are two horizontal lines (constant distance) and the slopes change during walking.Option C: No periods of constant distance and inconsistent return trip. This doesn't fit because there are two periods of constant distance, and the return trip should be consistent in terms of following the same route, just with a stop.Option D: Straight line indicating steady movement without stops. This doesn't fit because Sarah changes her pace and stops twice.Therefore, the correct answer should be Option B."},{"question":"Two circles of radius 2 are centered at (2,0) and at (0,2). What is the area of the intersection of the interiors of the two circles? Express your answer in fully expanded form in terms of pi.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two circles, both with radius 2. One is centered at (2,0) and the other at (0,2). I need to find the area of their intersection. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this first.If I plot these circles on a coordinate plane, the first circle is centered two units to the right of the origin along the x-axis, and the second one is centered two units up along the y-axis. Both have the same radius, so they should overlap somewhere in the middle. I think they intersect each other, and I need to find the area where they overlap.First, maybe I should find the points where the two circles intersect. To do that, I can set up the equations of both circles and solve them simultaneously.The equation of the first circle centered at (2,0) is:[(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4]And the equation of the second circle centered at (0,2) is:[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4]Okay, so I have two equations:1. ((x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4)2. (x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4)I need to solve these two equations to find the points of intersection. Let me expand both equations to make it easier.Expanding the first equation:[(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 = 4]Simplify:[x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[x^2 - 4x + y^2 = 0]Okay, that's the first equation simplified.Now, expanding the second equation:[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 4]Simplify:[x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[x^2 + y^2 - 4y = 0]Alright, so now I have two simplified equations:1. (x^2 - 4x + y^2 = 0)2. (x^2 + y^2 - 4y = 0)Hmm, maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate some variables. Let me subtract the second equation from the first:[(x^2 - 4x + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2 - 4y) = 0 - 0]Simplify:[x^2 - 4x + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 4y = 0]Which simplifies to:[-4x + 4y = 0]Divide both sides by 4:[-x + y = 0]So, (y = x). That means the points of intersection lie along the line (y = x). Now, I can substitute (y = x) back into one of the original equations to find the specific points.Let me substitute into the first equation:[(x - 2)^2 + x^2 = 4]Expanding ((x - 2)^2):[x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 = 4]Combine like terms:[2x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[2x^2 - 4x = 0]Factor out 2x:[2x(x - 2) = 0]So, (x = 0) or (x = 2). Since (y = x), the corresponding y-values are also 0 and 2. Therefore, the points of intersection are (0,0) and (2,2). Okay, that makes sense. So the two circles intersect at the origin and at (2,2).Now, I need to find the area of the intersection. Since both circles are identical in size and their centers are symmetric with respect to the line y = x, the intersection area should be symmetric across this line as well.I remember that the area of intersection between two circles can be found using the formula for the area of overlap, which involves the radii and the distance between the centers. Let me recall the formula.The general formula for the area of intersection of two circles with radii (r) and (R) and distance (d) between their centers is:[A = r^2 cos^{-1}left(frac{d^2 + r^2 - R^2}{2dr}right) + R^2 cos^{-1}left(frac{d^2 + R^2 - r^2}{2dR}right) - frac{1}{2}sqrt{(-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R)}]But in this case, both circles have the same radius, (r = R = 2). So the formula simplifies a bit.Let me denote (r = R = 2). Then the formula becomes:[A = 2r^2 cos^{-1}left(frac{d}{2r}right) - frac{d}{2} sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}]Where (d) is the distance between the centers.First, I need to compute the distance (d) between the centers at (2,0) and (0,2). Using the distance formula:[d = sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = sqrt{4 + 4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}]So, (d = 2sqrt{2}).Now, plugging into the formula:[A = 2(2)^2 cos^{-1}left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{2 times 2}right) - frac{2sqrt{2}}{2} sqrt{4(2)^2 - (2sqrt{2})^2}]Simplify step by step.First, compute the arguments inside the arccosine:[frac{2sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]So, (cos^{-1}left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)). I know that (cos(pi/4) = sqrt{2}/2), so this is (pi/4) radians.Next, compute the first term:[2(4) times frac{pi}{4} = 8 times frac{pi}{4} = 2pi]Now, the second term:[frac{2sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2}]And inside the square root:[4(4) - (8) = 16 - 8 = 8]So, (sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}).Putting it all together:[A = 2pi - sqrt{2} times 2sqrt{2}]Simplify the multiplication:[sqrt{2} times 2sqrt{2} = 2 times 2 = 4]Therefore, the area of intersection is:[A = 2pi - 4]So, the area is (2pi - 4).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found the points of intersection correctly at (0,0) and (2,2).2. Calculated the distance between centers correctly as (2sqrt{2}).3. Applied the formula for the area of intersection between two circles of equal radius.4. Plugged in the values correctly:   - (r = 2)   - (d = 2sqrt{2})5. Calculated (cos^{-1}(sqrt{2}/2) = pi/4).6. First term: (2 times 4 times pi/4 = 2pi).7. Second term: (sqrt{2} times 2sqrt{2} = 4).8. Subtracted to get (2pi - 4).Everything seems to check out. I think the area of the intersection is indeed (2pi - 4)."},{"question":"a) In the figure below, two interlocking gears are shown, gear (A) with 6 teeth and gear (B) with 8 teeth. All the teeth are the same size. If gear (A) makes 12 turns, how many turns will gear (B) make?b) Consider 5 interlocking gears. The first gear has 10 teeth, and it is interlocked with a second gear with 20 teeth, which in turn is interlocked with a third gear that has 40 teeth, which is interlocked with a fourth gear that has 80 teeth, which in turn is interlocked with a fifth gear that has 160 teeth. When the largest gear makes one turn, what is the sum of turns made by all the gears?c) Consider three gears (C, D,) and (E), where gear (C) is interlocked with gear (D) and gear (D) is interlocked with gear (E). Each gear has a certain number of teeth, all the same size. It is known that when gear (C) makes 160 turns, gear (D) makes 1007 turns, and gear (E) makes 38 turns. What is the minimum total number of teeth of the three gears combined for this to be possible?","answer":"Alright, so I've got these three problems about gears and their rotations. Let me try to work through each one step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gear ratios, but I remember that when two gears are interlocked, the number of teeth and the number of rotations are inversely proportional. That is, if one gear has more teeth, it will rotate slower compared to a gear with fewer teeth.**Problem a)**Okay, gear A has 6 teeth and gear B has 8 teeth. Gear A makes 12 turns. I need to find out how many turns gear B makes. Hmm, so since they're interlocked, the number of teeth that pass by each other should be the same for both gears. That means the total number of teeth passing by for gear A is 12 turns multiplied by 6 teeth per turn, which is 72 teeth. Now, for gear B, which has 8 teeth, the number of turns it makes should be such that 8 teeth per turn multiplied by the number of turns equals 72 teeth. So, if I let N be the number of turns gear B makes, then 8*N = 72. Solving for N, I divide both sides by 8, which gives N = 9. So, gear B makes 9 turns.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check. If gear A has 6 teeth and makes 12 turns, that's 72 teeth passing by. Gear B has 8 teeth, so 72 divided by 8 is indeed 9. Yep, that makes sense.**Problem b)**Now, this one is a bit more complex. There are five gears in a row, each interlocked with the next. The number of teeth on each gear doubles each time: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160. The largest gear, which has 160 teeth, makes one turn. I need to find the sum of the turns made by all the gears.Alright, so starting from the largest gear, which is the fifth gear with 160 teeth making one turn. Since each subsequent gear has half the number of teeth, each previous gear should make double the number of turns. So, if gear 5 makes 1 turn, gear 4 should make 2 turns, gear 3 makes 4 turns, gear 2 makes 8 turns, and gear 1 makes 16 turns.Let me list them out:- Gear 5: 1 turn- Gear 4: 2 turns- Gear 3: 4 turns- Gear 2: 8 turns- Gear 1: 16 turnsAdding them up: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16. Let me compute that. 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 8 is 15, plus 16 is 31. So, the total number of turns is 31.Wait, is that right? Each gear is interlocked, so the number of teeth that pass by should be the same for each pair. So, gear 5 with 160 teeth making 1 turn means 160 teeth pass by. Gear 4 has 80 teeth, so 160 teeth passing by would mean 2 turns for gear 4. Similarly, gear 3 has 40 teeth, so 160 teeth passing by would mean 4 turns, and so on. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the total is indeed 31 turns.**Problem c)**This one is trickier. We have three gears: C, D, and E. Gear C is interlocked with D, and D is interlocked with E. We're told that when gear C makes 160 turns, gear D makes 1007 turns, and gear E makes 38 turns. We need to find the minimum total number of teeth for all three gears combined.Hmm, okay. So, gears C and D are interlocked, and gears D and E are interlocked. The number of teeth and the number of turns are inversely proportional. So, the ratio of teeth between C and D should be equal to the inverse ratio of their turns. Similarly, the ratio of teeth between D and E should be equal to the inverse ratio of their turns.Let me denote the number of teeth on gears C, D, and E as N_C, N_D, and N_E respectively.From gear C to D: The ratio of teeth N_C / N_D should be equal to the ratio of turns N_D / N_C. Wait, no, actually, the number of teeth times the number of turns should be equal for both gears because the same number of teeth pass by the point of contact.So, for gears C and D: N_C * 160 = N_D * 1007.Similarly, for gears D and E: N_D * 1007 = N_E * 38.So, we have two equations:1. 160 * N_C = 1007 * N_D2. 1007 * N_D = 38 * N_EFrom the first equation: 160 N_C = 1007 N_D => N_C = (1007 / 160) N_DFrom the second equation: 1007 N_D = 38 N_E => N_E = (1007 / 38) N_DSo, N_C and N_E are expressed in terms of N_D. To find the minimum total number of teeth, we need to find the smallest integers N_C, N_D, N_E that satisfy these equations.Let me simplify the fractions:1007 / 160: Let's see, 1007 divided by 160. 160 goes into 1007 six times (6*160=960), with a remainder of 47. So, 1007/160 = 6 + 47/160. That doesn't simplify further since 47 is a prime number.Similarly, 1007 / 38: 38 goes into 1007 how many times? 38*26=988, so 26 times with a remainder of 19. So, 1007/38 = 26 + 19/38 = 26 + 1/2. So, 1007/38 = 26.5.Wait, but N_E must be an integer, so N_E = 26.5 * N_D. That suggests that N_D must be even to make N_E an integer. Let me check:N_E = (1007 / 38) N_D = (26.5) N_D. So, N_D must be a multiple of 2 to make N_E an integer. Let's denote N_D = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, N_E = 26.5 * 2k = 53k.Similarly, from N_C = (1007 / 160) N_D = (1007 / 160) * 2k = (1007 / 80) k.Now, 1007 divided by 80 is 12.5875, which isn't an integer. Hmm, so N_C must also be an integer. Therefore, k must be chosen such that 1007k is divisible by 80.1007 and 80: Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1007 and 80.Prime factors of 80: 2^4 * 5Prime factors of 1007: Let's see, 1007 divided by 19 is 53 (19*53=1007). So, 1007 is 19*53.So, GCD(1007,80)=1, since 19 and 53 are primes not shared with 80.Therefore, to make 1007k divisible by 80, k must be a multiple of 80. Let's set k=80m, where m is a positive integer.Then, N_D = 2k = 160mN_E = 53k = 53*80m = 4240mN_C = (1007 / 80)k = (1007 / 80)*80m = 1007mSo, the number of teeth for each gear is:N_C = 1007mN_D = 160mN_E = 4240mTo find the minimum total number of teeth, we set m=1.Therefore:N_C = 1007N_D = 160N_E = 4240Total teeth = 1007 + 160 + 4240 = 5407Wait, let me check if this makes sense.From gear C to D: 1007 teeth * 160 turns = 160 teeth * 1007 turns. Yes, that's equal.From gear D to E: 160 teeth * 1007 turns = 4240 teeth * 38 turns. Let's compute both sides:160 * 1007 = 161,1204240 * 38 = 161,120Yes, both sides are equal. So, the calculations are consistent.Therefore, the minimum total number of teeth is 5407.**Final Answer**a) boxed{9}b) boxed{31}c) boxed{5407}"},{"question":"A circle is internally tangent to another circle at point E. The tangent to the smaller circle at any point P intersects the larger circle at points A and B. Show that the line EP bisects the angle AEB.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here where there's a smaller circle that's internally tangent to a larger circle at point E. Then, if I take any point P on the smaller circle, the tangent at P intersects the larger circle at points A and B. I need to show that the line EP bisects the angle AEB. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me draw two circles, one inside the other, touching at point E. The smaller circle is inside the larger one, and they touch only at E. Now, pick any point P on the smaller circle. The tangent at P will just touch the smaller circle at P and then extend out to intersect the larger circle at two points, A and B. So, the tangent line at P cuts through the larger circle, creating chord AB.Now, I need to show that the line from E to P, which is EP, bisects the angle AEB. That means angle AEP should be equal to angle BEP. So, if I can show that these two angles are equal, then EP is indeed the angle bisector of angle AEB.Let me recall some properties of circles and tangents. The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I draw the radius from the center of the smaller circle to point P, that radius will be perpendicular to the tangent line at P.Wait, but in this case, the smaller circle is internally tangent to the larger one. So, their centers must lie along the same line as the point of tangency E. Let me denote the center of the larger circle as O and the center of the smaller circle as O'. So, points O, O', and E are colinear, with O' lying between O and E.Since the tangent at P is perpendicular to the radius O'P, and the line AB is this tangent, then O'P is perpendicular to AB. So, O'P is the perpendicular from O' to AB.Now, since AB is a chord of the larger circle, the line from the center O perpendicular to AB would bisect AB. But in this case, O'P is perpendicular to AB, but O' is not the center of the larger circle. Hmm, so maybe I need to relate O'P to the center O somehow.Wait, since the circles are tangent at E, the centers O and O' and the point E are colinear. So, the line OO' passes through E. Also, since O'P is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center of the larger circle, maybe there's a way to relate the angles at E.Let me think about the angles. If I can show that angle AEP equals angle BEP, then EP bisects angle AEB. To do this, maybe I can use some properties of angles subtended by the same arc or something related to similar triangles.Alternatively, perhaps inversion might help, but that might be too advanced for this problem. Maybe I can use homothety since the circles are tangent.Wait, homothety is a transformation that can map one circle to another, especially when they are tangent. The point of tangency E would be the center of homothety. So, if I consider a homothety centered at E that maps the smaller circle to the larger one, then point P on the smaller circle would map to some point P' on the larger circle.But how does this help with the tangent line? The tangent at P on the smaller circle would map to a tangent at P' on the larger circle. But in our case, the tangent at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, so maybe the image of the tangent line under homothety is the tangent at P', but it also intersects the larger circle at A and B. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.Let me try a different approach. Since O'P is perpendicular to AB, and O' is the center of the smaller circle, then O'P is the shortest distance from O' to AB. Also, since AB is a chord of the larger circle, the perpendicular from O to AB would bisect AB. Let me denote the midpoint of AB as M. So, OM is perpendicular to AB and bisects it.But O'P is also perpendicular to AB. So, both OM and O'P are perpendicular to AB, meaning they are parallel to each other. Since O, O', and E are colinear, maybe there's a way to relate these lines.Wait, if OM and O'P are both perpendicular to AB, then they must be parallel. So, the line from O to M is parallel to the line from O' to P. Since O, O', and E are colinear, perhaps we can use similar triangles or something.Let me consider triangles EMO and EP O'. Since OM is parallel to O'P, the triangles might be similar. Let me see. If I can show that triangle EMO is similar to triangle EPO', then maybe I can find some angle relationships.Alternatively, maybe I can use power of a point. The power of point P with respect to the larger circle is equal to PA * PB. But since P is on the smaller circle, and the tangent from P to the smaller circle is just the line AB, maybe there's a relation there.Wait, the power of point P with respect to the larger circle is PA * PB, and since P is on the smaller circle, which is internally tangent, maybe the power can be expressed in terms of the radii.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that EP is the angle bisector. To show that, I can use the angle bisector theorem, which states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.But in this case, we're dealing with circles, so maybe I need to use some circle theorems. Let me recall that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, the angle between tangent AB and chord PE is equal to the angle that PE makes with the chord in the alternate segment.Wait, that might be useful. So, the angle between tangent AB and chord PE is equal to the angle that PE makes with the chord in the alternate segment. But I'm not sure how that helps directly.Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then angle between AB and PE is equal to the angle that PE makes with the chord in the alternate segment of the smaller circle. But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can consider the angles at E. Let me denote angle AEP as α and angle BEP as β. I need to show that α = β.Since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then angle between AB and PE is equal to the angle that PE makes with the chord in the alternate segment of the smaller circle. So, angle between AB and PE is equal to angle EPP', where P' is some point on the smaller circle.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to consider the power of point E with respect to the smaller circle.Wait, E is the point of tangency, so the power of E with respect to the smaller circle is zero. That might not help directly.Alternatively, since E is on both circles, maybe I can use some properties related to that.Wait, let me think about the homothety again. If I have a homothety centered at E that maps the smaller circle to the larger one, then point P on the smaller circle maps to some point P' on the larger circle. The tangent at P on the smaller circle maps to the tangent at P' on the larger circle. But in our case, the tangent at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, so maybe the image of the tangent line under homothety is the tangent at P', but it also passes through A and B. Hmm, that seems conflicting.Wait, no, because homothety maps the tangent line at P to the tangent line at P', but in our case, the tangent line at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, so unless P' is one of those points, which it isn't necessarily.Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to use coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates can help.Let me set up a coordinate system where point E is at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that the larger circle has center at (d, 0) and radius R, and the smaller circle has center at (k, 0) and radius r. Since they are internally tangent at E, the distance between centers is equal to the difference in radii. So, d - k = R - r. Also, since E is the point of tangency, it lies on both circles, so for the larger circle, the distance from (d, 0) to (0,0) is R, so sqrt((d)^2 + 0) = R, so d = R. Similarly, for the smaller circle, the distance from (k, 0) to (0,0) is r, so sqrt(k^2) = r, so k = r. Therefore, the centers are at (R, 0) and (r, 0), and since they are internally tangent, R > r, and the distance between centers is R - r = R - r, which checks out.Now, let me parametrize point P on the smaller circle. Since the smaller circle is centered at (r, 0) with radius r, point P can be represented as (r + r cos θ, 0 + r sin θ) = (r(1 + cos θ), r sin θ).The tangent at P to the smaller circle has a slope perpendicular to the radius OP, where O is (r, 0). The slope of OP is (r sin θ - 0)/(r(1 + cos θ) - r) = (r sin θ)/(r cos θ) = tan θ. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at P is -cot θ.So, the equation of the tangent line at P is y - r sin θ = -cot θ (x - r(1 + cos θ)).Simplifying this, y = -cot θ x + cot θ * r(1 + cos θ) + r sin θ.Let me compute cot θ * r(1 + cos θ) + r sin θ:= r [cot θ (1 + cos θ) + sin θ]= r [ (cos θ / sin θ)(1 + cos θ) + sin θ ]= r [ (cos θ (1 + cos θ) + sin^2 θ) / sin θ ]= r [ (cos θ + cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ) / sin θ ]Since cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ = 1, this becomes:= r [ (cos θ + 1) / sin θ ]= r [ (1 + cos θ) / sin θ ]So, the equation of the tangent line is y = -cot θ x + r (1 + cos θ)/sin θ.Now, this tangent line intersects the larger circle centered at (R, 0) with radius R. The equation of the larger circle is (x - R)^2 + y^2 = R^2.Substituting y from the tangent line into the circle's equation:(x - R)^2 + [ -cot θ x + r (1 + cos θ)/sin θ ]^2 = R^2.This seems complicated, but maybe I can find points A and B by solving this equation. However, this might get too messy. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, since I know that the tangent line at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, and I need to find the angles at E, maybe I can use parametric equations or vector methods.Wait, maybe instead of coordinates, I can use inversion. Inversion might simplify the problem by transforming the circles into lines or other circles.But inversion might be too advanced. Let me think again about the properties.Since EP is supposed to bisect angle AEB, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem. If EP bisects angle AEB, then the ratio of EA to EB is equal to the ratio of the distances from A and B to the line EP.But I'm not sure how to apply that here.Wait, another idea: since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then EP is the angle bisector of angle AEB. Maybe I can use the fact that the tangent from E to the smaller circle would make equal angles with EA and EB.But E is on the larger circle, not the smaller one. Hmm.Wait, let me think about the power of point E with respect to the smaller circle. Since E is on the smaller circle, its power is zero. So, the tangent from E to the smaller circle has length zero, which is just the point E itself.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe I can consider triangle AEB and see if EP is the angle bisector. To do that, I can use the angle bisector theorem, which states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.But in this case, the opposite side is AB, and the line is EP. So, if EP bisects angle AEB, then EA/EB = PA/PB.But I don't know if EA/EB equals PA/PB. Maybe I can show that.Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then by the power of point A with respect to the smaller circle, we have AP^2 = AE * something. Wait, no, the power of point A with respect to the smaller circle is AP^2 = (distance from A to O')^2 - r^2.But I'm not sure.Wait, let me recall that the power of point A with respect to the smaller circle is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from A to the smaller circle, which is AP. So, power of A is AP^2 = AO'^2 - r^2.Similarly, for point B, power of B is BP^2 = BO'^2 - r^2.But since A and B lie on the larger circle, AO = BO = R, where O is the center of the larger circle.But O' is the center of the smaller circle, which is at (r, 0) in my coordinate system, while O is at (R, 0).So, AO'^2 = (A_x - r)^2 + A_y^2, and similarly for BO'^2.But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that EP is the angle bisector. Let me try to compute the angles.In my coordinate system, E is at (0,0), O is at (R,0), O' is at (r,0), and P is at (r(1 + cos θ), r sin θ).The line EP goes from (0,0) to (r(1 + cos θ), r sin θ). So, its slope is (r sin θ)/(r(1 + cos θ)) = sin θ / (1 + cos θ) = tan(θ/2).So, the angle that EP makes with the x-axis is θ/2.Now, let me find the angles AEB. Points A and B are on the larger circle, so their coordinates can be found by solving the tangent line equation with the larger circle's equation.But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, I can parametrize points A and B.Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, and E is the point of tangency of the two circles, maybe there's a homothety centered at E that maps the smaller circle to the larger one, and maps P to some point related to A and B.Wait, homothety centered at E would map the smaller circle to the larger circle, scaling by a factor of R/r. So, point P on the smaller circle would map to a point P' on the larger circle such that EP' = (R/r) EP.But how does this relate to points A and B?Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, and E is the point of tangency of the two circles, maybe the line EP is the angle bisector because of some symmetry.Wait, another idea: since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then the reflection of O' over AB lies on the tangent line. But I'm not sure.Wait, in general, the reflection of the center over the tangent line lies on the tangent line. So, reflecting O' over AB would give a point on AB. But I'm not sure how that helps.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the angle between EP and EA is equal to the angle between EP and EB. To show that, I can compute the angles using coordinates.Given that EP has a slope of tan(θ/2), and points A and B lie on the larger circle, maybe I can find the angles that EA and EB make with EP.But this seems involved. Maybe I can instead consider the angles subtended by EP at points A and B.Wait, another approach: since EP is the angle bisector, then the ratio of the sines of the angles is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle AEB, if EP bisects angle AEB, then the ratio of EA to EB is equal to the ratio of PA to PB.But I don't know if EA/EB = PA/PB. Maybe I can show that.Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P, then by the power of point A with respect to the smaller circle, we have AP^2 = AE * something. Wait, no, the power of point A with respect to the smaller circle is AP^2 = AO'^2 - r^2.Similarly, for point B, BP^2 = BO'^2 - r^2.But since A and B lie on the larger circle, AO = BO = R, where O is the center of the larger circle.But O' is the center of the smaller circle, which is at (r, 0) in my coordinate system, while O is at (R, 0).So, AO'^2 = (A_x - r)^2 + A_y^2, and similarly for BO'^2.But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, maybe I can consider the triangles EAP and EPB. If I can show that they are similar, then the angles would be equal.Alternatively, since EP is the angle bisector, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem which relates the ratio of the sides to the ratio of the adjacent segments.But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think about the angles again. If I can show that angle AEP equals angle BEP, then EP bisects angle AEB.Given that EP has a slope of tan(θ/2), and points A and B are symmetric with respect to the line EP, maybe the angles are equal.Wait, in my coordinate system, if I can show that the angles between EP and EA, and EP and EB are equal, then EP bisects angle AEB.But how?Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the tangent at P makes equal angles with EP and the chord in the alternate segment.Wait, in circle geometry, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, the angle between tangent AB and chord EP is equal to the angle that EP makes with the chord in the alternate segment of the smaller circle.But since E is the point of tangency of the two circles, maybe this angle is equal to the angle in the alternate segment of the larger circle as well.Wait, maybe not. Let me think.In the smaller circle, the angle between tangent AB and chord EP is equal to the angle that EP makes with the chord in the alternate segment. Let's call this angle α.Similarly, in the larger circle, the angle between tangent AB and chord EP would be equal to the angle that EP makes with the chord in the alternate segment of the larger circle. But since AB is not tangent to the larger circle, this might not hold.Wait, but AB is a secant of the larger circle, so maybe the angle between AB and EP is equal to the angle subtended by the chord EP in the alternate segment.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: since EP is the angle bisector, then the reflection of EP over EA should coincide with the reflection over EB. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the angles subtended by EP at A and B are equal.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.Wait, let me consider the homothety again. If I have a homothety centered at E that maps the smaller circle to the larger one, then point P maps to some point P' on the larger circle. The tangent at P maps to the tangent at P', but in our case, the tangent at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, so maybe P' is one of those points.But since the tangent at P on the smaller circle maps to the tangent at P' on the larger circle, and the tangent at P' would only intersect the larger circle at P', not at two points. So, maybe this isn't the case.Wait, unless the tangent at P on the smaller circle, when extended, intersects the larger circle at A and B, which are the same as the tangent points under homothety. Hmm, I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe the homothety maps the tangent line at P to the tangent line at P', but since the tangent line at P intersects the larger circle at A and B, which are different from P', maybe this isn't helpful.Wait, maybe I can consider the midpoint of AB. Since AB is a chord of the larger circle, the line from O perpendicular to AB bisects AB. Let me denote the midpoint as M. So, OM is perpendicular to AB.But O'P is also perpendicular to AB, as O'P is the radius of the smaller circle at P, and AB is tangent to the smaller circle at P.So, both OM and O'P are perpendicular to AB, meaning they are parallel to each other.Since O, O', and E are colinear, and OM is parallel to O'P, maybe there's a homothety that maps O'P to OM.Wait, since OM is parallel to O'P, and O, O', E are colinear, maybe the homothety centered at E that maps O' to O also maps P to M.So, if I have a homothety centered at E that maps O' to O, then it would map P to M, since O'P is parallel to OM.Therefore, the homothety centered at E with scale factor k = EO / EO' would map O' to O and P to M.Since the homothety maps the smaller circle to the larger one, point P on the smaller circle maps to point M on the larger circle.But M is the midpoint of AB, so the homothety maps P to M.Therefore, the line EP maps to the line EM under homothety. But since homothety preserves lines, EP and EM are the same line.Wait, but M is the midpoint of AB, so EM is the line from E to the midpoint of AB.But we need to show that EP bisects angle AEB, which would mean that EP is the angle bisector, not necessarily that it goes to the midpoint.Wait, but if EP maps to EM under homothety, and EM is the line to the midpoint, then maybe EP is the angle bisector.Wait, in homothety, angles are preserved, so if EP is mapped to EM, and EM is the line to the midpoint, which in some cases is the angle bisector, but not always.Wait, but in this case, since AB is tangent to the smaller circle, and the homothety maps P to M, maybe the angles are preserved in such a way that EP bisects angle AEB.Alternatively, since the homothety preserves angles, and EP maps to EM, which is the line to the midpoint, which in some cases is the angle bisector, maybe in this specific configuration, it is.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, another idea: since O'P is perpendicular to AB, and O'P is parallel to OM, which is the perpendicular from O to AB, then triangles EPO' and EMO are similar because they are both right triangles and they share the angle at E.Therefore, triangle EPO' ~ triangle EMO by AA similarity.So, the ratio of similarity is EO' / EO = EP / EM.But since homothety maps O' to O and P to M, the ratio is consistent.Therefore, the angles at E are preserved, meaning that angle EPO' equals angle EMO, and angle EP O' equals angle E M O.But since O'P is parallel to OM, the angles are equal.Therefore, the angles that EP makes with EA and EB are equal, meaning that EP bisects angle AEB.Wait, I think this is the key. Since triangles EPO' and EMO are similar, the angles at E are equal, meaning that EP bisects angle AEB.So, putting it all together, because of the homothety and the similar triangles, EP bisects angle AEB.I think that makes sense. So, the line EP bisects the angle AEB because of the similarity of triangles EPO' and EMO, which is a result of the homothety centered at E mapping the smaller circle to the larger one and preserving the angles."},{"question":"Is the ratio of 50 kg to 0.5 tons 100:1?

This is done by dividing both quantities by their greatest common divisor, which is 50.After simplifying, the ratio becomes 1:10.

The equation is x + y + z + t = 10. What is the value of t in one of the solutions?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there are 84 positive integer solutions for the equation x + y + z + t = 10. I need to find the value of t in one of these solutions. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially with multiple variables, it's often useful to use the concept of combinations or the stars and bars method. Stars and bars is a popular combinatorial method used to solve problems related to distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins. In this case, the \\"objects\\" are the total sum, which is 10, and the \\"bins\\" are the variables x, y, z, and t.Since we're dealing with positive integers, each variable must be at least 1. That means x, y, z, and t are all ≥ 1. To apply the stars and bars theorem, we can adjust the equation to account for this minimum value. If each variable is at least 1, we can subtract 1 from each variable to make them non-negative integers. So, let's define new variables:x' = x - 1  y' = y - 1  z' = z - 1  t' = t - 1Now, substituting these into the original equation:(x' + 1) + (y' + 1) + (z' + 1) + (t' + 1) = 10Simplifying this, we get:x' + y' + z' + t' + 4 = 10Subtracting 4 from both sides:x' + y' + z' + t' = 6Now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Using the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions is given by:C(n + k - 1, k - 1)Where n is the total number of objects (in this case, 6) and k is the number of bins (in this case, 4 variables). Plugging in the numbers:C(6 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(9, 3)Calculating C(9, 3):C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84So, there are indeed 84 positive integer solutions, which matches the information given in the problem.Now, the question is asking for the value of t in one of these solutions. Since there are multiple solutions, there isn't a unique value for t. However, I can provide an example of one possible solution.Let's choose specific values for x, y, and z, and then solve for t. For simplicity, let's set x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3. Plugging these into the original equation:1 + 2 + 3 + t = 10Adding the known values:6 + t = 10Subtracting 6 from both sides:t = 4So, in this particular solution, t is 4. But as I mentioned earlier, there are many other possible values for t depending on the values chosen for x, y, and z.To further explore this, let's consider another example. Suppose x = 2, y = 2, and z = 2. Then:2 + 2 + 2 + t = 10Adding the known values:6 + t = 10Again, subtracting 6 from both sides:t = 4Interesting, t is still 4 in this case. Let's try another set where t might be different. Let's say x = 1, y = 1, and z = 1:1 + 1 + 1 + t = 10Adding the known values:3 + t = 10Subtracting 3 from both sides:t = 7Okay, so in this solution, t is 7. This shows that t can vary depending on the values of x, y, and z.Let's try one more example where t is even higher. Suppose x = 1, y = 1, and z = 2:1 + 1 + 2 + t = 10Adding the known values:4 + t = 10Subtracting 4 from both sides:t = 6So, t can be 6 in this case.From these examples, it seems that t can take on various values, such as 4, 6, 7, and so on, depending on how the sum of 10 is distributed among x, y, z, and t.To summarize, while there are 84 different positive integer solutions to the equation x + y + z + t = 10, the value of t can vary within these solutions. In the examples I provided, t was 4, 6, and 7. Therefore, without additional constraints, t can be any integer that allows the sum of x + y + z + t to equal 10, with each variable being at least 1.If I were to generalize, the possible values of t can range from 1 up to 7, since if t were 8, then x + y + z would have to be 2, which isn't possible with each of x, y, and z being at least 1 (since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is greater than 2). Similarly, t cannot be less than 1 because we're dealing with positive integers.So, the possible values of t are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each of these values corresponds to different combinations of x, y, and z that satisfy the equation.In conclusion, while there isn't a single value for t in all solutions, t can take on multiple values depending on the specific combination of x, y, and z. The examples I provided demonstrate that t can be 4, 6, or 7, among other possibilities."},{"question":"A faulty car odometer skips the digit 5, moving directly from 4 to 6. If the odometer now reads 003006, how many miles has the car actually traveled?A) 2187B) 2190C) 2192D) 2200E) 2210","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a faulty car odometer. The odometer skips the digit 5, meaning it goes from 4 directly to 6. The current reading is 003006, and I need to figure out how many actual miles the car has traveled. The options are A) 2187, B) 2190, C) 2192, D) 2200, and E) 2210.Hmm, let me think about how odometers work. Normally, an odometer counts up by 1 each mile, right? But in this case, it's skipping the digit 5. So, instead of counting 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, it goes 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. That means each digit on this faulty odometer only has 9 possible numbers instead of 10. So, it's almost like a base-9 system instead of base-10.Wait, so if each digit is effectively in base-9, then the reading 003006 on this faulty odometer is actually a base-9 number, but with the digits shifted because it's skipping 5. So, to convert it to the actual miles, I need to interpret 003006 as a base-9 number and then convert it to base-10.Let me write down the number: 003006. Since leading zeros don't affect the value, I can ignore them and just consider 3006 in base-9. But wait, actually, the odometer is a six-digit number, so maybe I should consider all six digits for the conversion? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to treat it as a six-digit number in base-9.But let me think again. If each digit is base-9, then each position represents powers of 9. So, the rightmost digit is 9^0, then 9^1, 9^2, and so on. So, for 003006, starting from the right:- The first digit (units place) is 6, which is 6 * 9^0 = 6 * 1 = 6- The second digit is 0, which is 0 * 9^1 = 0- The third digit is 0, which is 0 * 9^2 = 0- The fourth digit is 3, which is 3 * 9^3 = 3 * 729 = 2187- The fifth digit is 0, which is 0 * 9^4 = 0- The sixth digit is 0, which is 0 * 9^5 = 0Adding all these up: 2187 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 2193. Wait, but 2193 isn't one of the options. Did I do something wrong?Wait a second, maybe I'm miscounting the digits. Let me check again. The number is 003006. So, from right to left:- Position 0: 6- Position 1: 0- Position 2: 0- Position 3: 3- Position 4: 0- Position 5: 0So, calculating:- 6 * 9^0 = 6- 0 * 9^1 = 0- 0 * 9^2 = 0- 3 * 9^3 = 3 * 729 = 2187- 0 * 9^4 = 0- 0 * 9^5 = 0Total: 2187 + 6 = 2193. Hmm, still 2193, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the skipping affects the digits.Wait, perhaps the issue is that the odometer skips the digit 5, so when it rolls over, it skips that digit. So, for example, after 4 comes 6, meaning that each digit is effectively counting in base-9, but the digits above 5 are shifted. So, when the odometer shows 6, it actually represents 5 in base-10.Wait, that might be the key. So, each digit on the faulty odometer is actually one less than the actual digit for numbers above 5. So, 6 on the odometer is 5 in reality, 7 is 6, 8 is 7, 9 is 8. So, to convert the faulty odometer reading to actual miles, I need to adjust each digit accordingly.So, let's take the reading 003006. Let's break it down digit by digit:- The first digit (from the right) is 6. Since it's in the units place, and 6 on the odometer is actually 5. So, 5 * 1 = 5.- The second digit is 0. That's straightforward, 0 * 9 = 0.- The third digit is 0. Again, 0 * 81 = 0.- The fourth digit is 3. Since 3 is below 5, it remains 3. So, 3 * 729 = 2187.- The fifth digit is 0. 0 * 6561 = 0.- The sixth digit is 0. 0 * 59049 = 0.Adding these up: 2187 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 2192. Ah, that's one of the options, option C.Wait, so I think my initial mistake was not adjusting the digits above 5. Each digit on the faulty odometer that is 6 or above needs to be reduced by 1 to get the actual digit. So, 6 becomes 5, 7 becomes 6, etc. Therefore, when converting, I need to subtract 1 from each digit that is 6 or above before calculating the actual value.Let me verify this with a smaller number. Suppose the odometer reads 000006. According to the faulty system, that should represent 5 miles. If I apply the same method: 6 in the units place becomes 5, so 5 * 1 = 5. That makes sense.Another example: odometer reads 000010. In the faulty system, after 000009 comes 000010. But since it skips 5, the actual miles would be 9 (since 000009 is 9, and 000010 is 10). Wait, no, actually, in the faulty system, each digit is base-9, so 000010 would be 9 in base-10. But in reality, it should be 9 miles because it skipped 5. Wait, no, if the odometer skips 5, then 000009 would be 9 miles, and 000010 would be 10 miles. But in the faulty system, 000010 is actually 9 in base-10 because it's base-9. So, there's a discrepancy here.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. If the odometer skips 5, then each digit is effectively base-9, but the digits above 5 are shifted. So, when converting, each digit on the odometer is mapped as follows:Odometer digit: 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9Actual digit:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8So, to convert the odometer reading to actual miles, I need to replace each digit 6-9 with 5-8 respectively.Therefore, for the reading 003006:- The first digit is 6, which maps to 5.- The rest are 0s and a 3, which maps to 3.So, the number becomes 3005 in base-9.Now, converting 3005 from base-9 to base-10:3 * 9^3 + 0 * 9^2 + 0 * 9^1 + 5 * 9^0= 3 * 729 + 0 + 0 + 5= 2187 + 5= 2192.Yes, that matches option C. So, the actual miles traveled are 2192.I think that's the correct approach. Initially, I forgot to adjust the digits above 5, which led me to an incorrect total. By mapping each odometer digit to the actual digit and then converting the entire number from base-9 to base-10, I arrive at the correct answer."},{"question":"0.20 of a number decreased by 4 is equal to 6.

I need to figure out which ones are correct. Let me take them one by one and think through each carefully.Starting with **Statement A**: \\"A necessary but not sufficient condition for ( a > b ) is ( a + 1 > b ).\\" Hmm, okay. So, if ( a > b ), then adding 1 to both sides would give ( a + 1 > b + 1 ), which simplifies to ( a + 1 > b ). That makes sense. So, ( a + 1 > b ) must be true if ( a > b ). But is it enough on its own? Let's see. If ( a + 1 > b ), does that necessarily mean ( a > b )? Well, suppose ( a = b ). Then ( a + 1 = b + 1 ), which is greater than ( b ), but ( a ) is not greater than ( b ). So, ( a + 1 > b ) doesn't guarantee ( a > b ). Therefore, ( a + 1 > b ) is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. So, **A** seems correct.Moving on to **Statement B**: \\"If the set ( A = {x | ax^2 + x + 1 = 0} ) has only one element, then ( a = frac{1}{4} ).\\" Okay, so ( A ) is the set of solutions to the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + x + 1 = 0 ). For a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant ( D ) is ( b^2 - 4ac ). Here, ( a = a ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = 1 ). So, ( D = 1^2 - 4(a)(1) = 1 - 4a ). Setting ( D = 0 ) gives ( 1 - 4a = 0 ), so ( a = frac{1}{4} ). That seems straightforward. But wait, what if ( a = 0 )? Then the equation becomes linear: ( x + 1 = 0 ), which also has exactly one solution. So, ( a ) could be ( frac{1}{4} ) or ( 0 ). Therefore, the statement is incomplete because ( a ) doesn't have to be ( frac{1}{4} ) exclusively. So, **B** is incorrect.Next is **Statement C**: \\"Given ( p: forall x in mathbb{R}, frac{1}{x - 2} > 0 ), the set of ( x ) corresponding to the negation of ( p ) is ( {x | x leq 2} ).\\" Let's parse this. The statement ( p ) says that for all real numbers ( x ), ( frac{1}{x - 2} ) is greater than 0. When is ( frac{1}{x - 2} > 0 )? Well, the fraction is positive when the denominator is positive, so ( x - 2 > 0 ), which means ( x > 2 ). Therefore, ( p ) is true only when ( x > 2 ). The negation of ( p ) would be that there exists some ( x ) where ( frac{1}{x - 2} leq 0 ). That happens when ( x - 2 leq 0 ), so ( x leq 2 ). Therefore, the set of ( x ) where the negation holds is indeed ( {x | x leq 2} ). So, **C** is correct.Finally, **Statement D**: \\"Given the set ( M = {0, 1} ), the number of sets ( N ) satisfying the condition ( M cup N = M ) is 3.\\" Okay, so ( M cup N = M ) implies that ( N ) is a subset of ( M ). The number of subsets of ( M ) is ( 2^2 = 4 ), which are: the empty set, ( {0} ), ( {1} ), and ( {0, 1} ). So, there are 4 such sets ( N ), not 3. Therefore, **D** is incorrect.So, summarizing my thoughts: **A** and **C** are correct, while **B** and **D** are incorrect."},{"question":"On a particularly sunny day, Alan decides to drink a glass of water every 20 minutes to stay hydrated.

It says that one vertex has edge lengths of 3, 4, and 5. All eight vertices of this solid lie on the same spherical surface. I need to find the surface area of this sphere, and the options are given as A: 25π, B: 50π, C: 125π, D: 75π.Hmm, let me visualize this. A rectangular solid has length, width, and height. In this case, from one vertex, the edges are 3, 4, and 5 units long. So, it's like a box where each edge from that corner is 3, 4, and 5. Now, all the vertices lie on a sphere, which means the sphere is circumscribed around the rectangular solid. So, the sphere touches all the corners of the box.I remember that for a rectangular solid, the sphere that passes through all its vertices has its center at the midpoint of the space diagonal of the solid. The space diagonal is the longest diagonal that goes from one corner of the box to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the box.To find the radius of the sphere, I need to find the length of this space diagonal and then divide it by 2 because the radius is half the diameter. The space diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula for the space diagonal (d) is:d = √(length² + width² + height²)So, plugging in the values given: length = 3, width = 4, height = 5.Calculating that:d = √(3² + 4² + 5²) = √(9 + 16 + 25) = √(50) = 5√2So, the space diagonal is 5√2 units long. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 5√2, which means the radius (r) is half of that:r = (5√2)/2Now, the surface area (S) of a sphere is given by the formula:S = 4πr²Substituting the value of r:S = 4π * (5√2 / 2)²Let me compute that step by step. First, square the radius:(5√2 / 2)² = (25 * 2) / 4 = 50 / 4 = 12.5Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.(5√2 / 2)² = (5√2)² / (2)² = (25 * 2) / 4 = 50 / 4 = 12.5Hmm, 12.5 is equal to 25/2. So, 25/2 is 12.5. So, plugging that back into the surface area formula:S = 4π * (25/2) = (4 * 25/2)π = (100/2)π = 50πSo, the surface area is 50π, which is option B.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the space diagonal is √(3² + 4² + 5²) = √50 = 5√2. That's correct. Then, the radius is half of that, so (5√2)/2. Squaring that gives (25 * 2)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5. Then, multiplying by 4π gives 50π. Yeah, that seems right.Alternatively, I could think of it as the radius squared is (25 * 2)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5, so 4π times 12.5 is 50π. Yep, that checks out.So, I think the answer is B: 50π.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"What is the remainder of 17^{1499} divided by 23?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: What is the remainder when 17 raised to the power of 1499 is divided by 23? Hmm, that seems pretty big, especially since 17 is a relatively large base and 1499 is a huge exponent. I remember something about modular arithmetic from my math class, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here. Let me think through this step by step.First, I know that when dealing with large exponents modulo a number, it's helpful to look for patterns or cycles in the powers of the base modulo that number. Maybe if I can find a repeating cycle in the powers of 17 modulo 23, I can simplify the problem.Let me start by calculating the first few powers of 17 modulo 23 to see if there's a pattern.17^1 mod 23 is just 17, since 17 is less than 23.17^2 is 289. Now, to find 289 mod 23, I can divide 289 by 23 and find the remainder. Let's see, 23 times 12 is 276. Subtracting that from 289 gives 13. So, 17^2 mod 23 is 13.Next, 17^3 is 17^2 times 17, which is 13 times 17. Let me calculate that: 13 times 17 is 221. Now, 221 divided by 23 is 9 with a remainder. 23 times 9 is 207, so 221 minus 207 is 14. So, 17^3 mod 23 is 14.Moving on to 17^4, which is 17^3 times 17, so that's 14 times 17. 14 times 17 is 238. Dividing 238 by 23, 23 times 10 is 230, so the remainder is 8. Therefore, 17^4 mod 23 is 8.Hmm, so far, the remainders are 17, 13, 14, and 8 for exponents 1 through 4. Let me keep going to see if a pattern emerges.17^5 is 17^4 times 17, which is 8 times 17. 8 times 17 is 136. Dividing 136 by 23, 23 times 5 is 115, so the remainder is 21. So, 17^5 mod 23 is 21.17^6 is 17^5 times 17, which is 21 times 17. 21 times 17 is 357. Dividing 357 by 23, 23 times 15 is 345, so the remainder is 12. Thus, 17^6 mod 23 is 12.17^7 is 17^6 times 17, so 12 times 17 is 204. Dividing 204 by 23, 23 times 8 is 184, so the remainder is 20. Therefore, 17^7 mod 23 is 20.17^8 is 17^7 times 17, which is 20 times 17. 20 times 17 is 340. Dividing 340 by 23, 23 times 14 is 322, so the remainder is 18. So, 17^8 mod 23 is 18.17^9 is 17^8 times 17, which is 18 times 17. 18 times 17 is 306. Dividing 306 by 23, 23 times 13 is 299, so the remainder is 7. Therefore, 17^9 mod 23 is 7.17^10 is 17^9 times 17, which is 7 times 17. 7 times 17 is 119. Dividing 119 by 23, 23 times 5 is 115, so the remainder is 4. Thus, 17^10 mod 23 is 4.17^11 is 17^10 times 17, which is 4 times 17. 4 times 17 is 68. Dividing 68 by 23, 23 times 2 is 46, so the remainder is 22. Therefore, 17^11 mod 23 is 22.17^12 is 17^11 times 17, which is 22 times 17. 22 times 17 is 374. Dividing 374 by 23, 23 times 16 is 368, so the remainder is 6. Thus, 17^12 mod 23 is 6.17^13 is 17^12 times 17, which is 6 times 17. 6 times 17 is 102. Dividing 102 by 23, 23 times 4 is 92, so the remainder is 10. Therefore, 17^13 mod 23 is 10.17^14 is 17^13 times 17, which is 10 times 17. 10 times 17 is 170. Dividing 170 by 23, 23 times 7 is 161, so the remainder is 9. Thus, 17^14 mod 23 is 9.17^15 is 17^14 times 17, which is 9 times 17. 9 times 17 is 153. Dividing 153 by 23, 23 times 6 is 138, so the remainder is 15. Therefore, 17^15 mod 23 is 15.17^16 is 17^15 times 17, which is 15 times 17. 15 times 17 is 255. Dividing 255 by 23, 23 times 11 is 253, so the remainder is 2. Thus, 17^16 mod 23 is 2.17^17 is 17^16 times 17, which is 2 times 17. 2 times 17 is 34. Dividing 34 by 23, the remainder is 11. So, 17^17 mod 23 is 11.17^18 is 17^17 times 17, which is 11 times 17. 11 times 17 is 187. Dividing 187 by 23, 23 times 8 is 184, so the remainder is 3. Therefore, 17^18 mod 23 is 3.17^19 is 17^18 times 17, which is 3 times 17. 3 times 17 is 51. Dividing 51 by 23, the remainder is 5. Thus, 17^19 mod 23 is 5.17^20 is 17^19 times 17, which is 5 times 17. 5 times 17 is 85. Dividing 85 by 23, 23 times 3 is 69, so the remainder is 16. Therefore, 17^20 mod 23 is 16.17^21 is 17^20 times 17, which is 16 times 17. 16 times 17 is 272. Dividing 272 by 23, 23 times 11 is 253, so the remainder is 19. Thus, 17^21 mod 23 is 19.17^22 is 17^21 times 17, which is 19 times 17. 19 times 17 is 323. Dividing 323 by 23, 23 times 14 is 322, so the remainder is 1. Therefore, 17^22 mod 23 is 1.Wait a minute, 17^22 mod 23 is 1. That's interesting. So, 17^22 is congruent to 1 modulo 23. That means that the powers of 17 modulo 23 repeat every 22 exponents. So, the cycle length here is 22.Given that, I can use this cycle to simplify 17^1499 mod 23. Since the cycle repeats every 22 exponents, I can find the remainder when 1499 is divided by 22, and then use that to find the equivalent exponent within the cycle.So, let's calculate 1499 divided by 22. Let me do that division.22 times 68 is 1496. So, 1499 minus 1496 is 3. Therefore, 1499 divided by 22 is 68 with a remainder of 3. So, 1499 = 22*68 + 3.That means that 17^1499 mod 23 is the same as 17^3 mod 23, because the exponents repeat every 22. From earlier, I calculated 17^3 mod 23 as 14.Wait, but earlier, when I calculated 17^3 mod 23, I got 14. But in the initial thought process, I thought it was 11. Hmm, let me double-check that.Wait, no, in the initial thought process, I thought that 17^4 mod 23 was 1, but actually, from my calculations, 17^22 mod 23 is 1, so the cycle length is 22, not 4. So, my initial thought was incorrect.Therefore, I need to correct that. The cycle length is 22, not 4. So, 17^22 mod 23 is 1, which means that 17^(22k) mod 23 is 1 for any integer k.Given that, 17^1499 can be written as 17^(22*68 + 3), which is equal to (17^22)^68 * 17^3. Since 17^22 mod 23 is 1, this simplifies to 1^68 * 17^3 mod 23, which is just 17^3 mod 23.From my earlier calculations, 17^3 mod 23 is 14. Therefore, the remainder when 17^1499 is divided by 23 is 14.Wait, but in the initial thought process, I thought it was 11. That was a mistake because I incorrectly assumed the cycle length was 4, but it's actually 22. So, the correct remainder is 14.But let me double-check my calculations to be sure.17^1 mod 23 = 1717^2 mod 23 = 17*17 = 289 mod 23. 23*12 = 276, so 289 - 276 = 13. So, 13.17^3 = 17^2 *17 = 13*17 = 221 mod 23. 23*9 = 207, so 221 - 207 = 14. So, 14.17^4 = 17^3 *17 = 14*17 = 238 mod 23. 23*10 = 230, so 238 - 230 = 8. So, 8.17^5 = 8*17 = 136 mod 23. 23*5 = 115, so 136 - 115 = 21. So, 21.17^6 = 21*17 = 357 mod 23. 23*15 = 345, so 357 - 345 = 12. So, 12.17^7 = 12*17 = 204 mod 23. 23*8 = 184, so 204 - 184 = 20. So, 20.17^8 = 20*17 = 340 mod 23. 23*14 = 322, so 340 - 322 = 18. So, 18.17^9 = 18*17 = 306 mod 23. 23*13 = 299, so 306 - 299 = 7. So, 7.17^10 = 7*17 = 119 mod 23. 23*5 = 115, so 119 - 115 = 4. So, 4.17^11 = 4*17 = 68 mod 23. 23*2 = 46, so 68 - 46 = 22. So, 22.17^12 = 22*17 = 374 mod 23. 23*16 = 368, so 374 - 368 = 6. So, 6.17^13 = 6*17 = 102 mod 23. 23*4 = 92, so 102 - 92 = 10. So, 10.17^14 = 10*17 = 170 mod 23. 23*7 = 161, so 170 - 161 = 9. So, 9.17^15 = 9*17 = 153 mod 23. 23*6 = 138, so 153 - 138 = 15. So, 15.17^16 = 15*17 = 255 mod 23. 23*11 = 253, so 255 - 253 = 2. So, 2.17^17 = 2*17 = 34 mod 23. 34 - 23 = 11. So, 11.17^18 = 11*17 = 187 mod 23. 23*8 = 184, so 187 - 184 = 3. So, 3.17^19 = 3*17 = 51 mod 23. 51 - 2*23 = 51 - 46 = 5. So, 5.17^20 = 5*17 = 85 mod 23. 23*3 = 69, so 85 - 69 = 16. So, 16.17^21 = 16*17 = 272 mod 23. 23*11 = 253, so 272 - 253 = 19. So, 19.17^22 = 19*17 = 323 mod 23. 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. So, 1.Yes, so 17^22 mod 23 is indeed 1, confirming that the cycle length is 22.Therefore, 17^1499 mod 23 is the same as 17^(1499 mod 22) mod 23. As calculated earlier, 1499 divided by 22 is 68 with a remainder of 3. So, 1499 mod 22 is 3.Thus, 17^1499 mod 23 is equal to 17^3 mod 23, which we found to be 14.Wait, but earlier in the initial thought process, I thought it was 11. That was a mistake because I incorrectly assumed the cycle length was 4, but it's actually 22. So, the correct remainder is 14.But let me double-check one more time to be absolutely sure.Given that 17^22 ≡ 1 mod 23, then 17^(22k) ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 mod 23 for any integer k.So, 17^1499 = 17^(22*68 + 3) = (17^22)^68 * 17^3 ≡ 1^68 * 17^3 ≡ 17^3 mod 23.From earlier calculations, 17^3 mod 23 is 14.Therefore, the remainder when 17^1499 is divided by 23 is 14.I think that's correct now. Initially, I made a mistake by assuming the cycle length was 4, but upon recalculating, I found that the cycle length is actually 22. So, the correct remainder is 14."},{"question":"Let two circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 intersect at two distinct points A and B. Let P in Gamma_1 and Q in Gamma_2 such that P, B, Q are collinear in this order. Let T be the intersection of the tangents to Gamma_2 at P and Q.Show that A Q T P is concyclic.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to show that points A, Q, T, and P lie on a single circle, which means they are concyclic. Let me start by understanding the given information and then figure out how to approach the proof.We have two circles, Γ₁ and Γ₂, intersecting at points A and B. So, A and B are the common points of these two circles. Then, there's a point P on Γ₁ and a point Q on Γ₂ such that P, B, Q are collinear in that order. That means if I draw a line through P and Q, it passes through B, and the order is P, then B, then Q.Next, T is defined as the intersection of the tangents to Γ₂ at points P and Q. So, if I draw the tangent to Γ₂ at P and another tangent at Q, these two lines will meet at point T. My goal is to show that A, Q, T, and P lie on a circle.First, I recall that if four points are concyclic, then the opposite angles of the quadrilateral formed by these points sum up to 180 degrees. So, if I can show that angle PAQ plus angle PTQ equals 180 degrees, or some other pair of opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, then I can conclude that A, Q, T, and P are concyclic.Let me try to visualize this. Since T is the intersection of the tangents at P and Q to Γ₂, I know that TP and TQ are both tangents from T to Γ₂. There's a property that says the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, TP = TQ. That might be useful later.Now, since P is on Γ₁ and Q is on Γ₂, and both circles intersect at A and B, point A is common to both circles. So, angles subtended by the same chord in a circle are equal. Maybe I can use that.Let me think about angles involving point A. Since A is on both Γ₁ and Γ₂, angles at A related to points P and Q might have some relationship. For example, angle PAQ is an angle at A subtended by points P and Q. If I can relate this angle to angle PTQ, which is at point T, maybe I can find a relationship that shows their sum is 180 degrees.Wait, angle PTQ is the angle between the two tangents at P and Q. There's a theorem that says the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to twice the angle subtended by the chord PQ at the center of the circle. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.Alternatively, I remember that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, for example, the angle between tangent TP and chord PQ is equal to the angle that PQ subtends in the alternate segment of Γ₂. Similarly, the angle between tangent TQ and chord QP is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.Let me denote the angle between TP and PQ as angle TPQ. According to the alternate segment theorem, angle TPQ is equal to the angle that PQ subtends in the alternate segment, which would be angle PAB, since A is a point on Γ₂. Similarly, the angle between TQ and QP, which is angle TQP, is equal to angle QAB.So, angle TPQ = angle PAB and angle TQP = angle QAB.Now, in triangle TPQ, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, angle TPQ + angle TQP + angle PTQ = 180 degrees. Substituting the alternate segment angles, we get angle PAB + angle QAB + angle PTQ = 180 degrees.But angle PAB + angle QAB is just angle PAQ, since A is a common vertex. Therefore, angle PAQ + angle PTQ = 180 degrees.This is exactly the condition we need for points A, Q, T, and P to be concyclic. Because in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. Here, angle PAQ and angle PTQ are opposite angles in quadrilateral AQTP, and their sum is 180 degrees. Therefore, AQTP must be a cyclic quadrilateral.So, I think I've found the necessary relationship. By using the alternate segment theorem and the properties of angles in a triangle, I was able to show that the sum of angle PAQ and angle PTQ is 180 degrees, which proves that A, Q, T, and P lie on a circle.I should double-check if there are any other properties or theorems I might have missed that could affect this conclusion. For example, ensuring that the points are indeed positioned as described and that the tangents and angles are correctly identified. But given the information, this seems like a solid approach.Another way to think about it is using power of a point. The power of point T with respect to Γ₂ is equal to TP² (since TP is a tangent). Similarly, the power of T with respect to Γ₁ might also be considered, but since T is defined based on Γ₂, maybe focusing on Γ₂ is sufficient.But since I've already established the angle condition, I think that's sufficient for the proof."},{"question":"Nadine went to a garage sale and spent 56.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem says that λ is equal to the integral from 0 to 3 of x squared dx. I remember that integrating x squared is straightforward. The integral of x squared is (1/3)x cubed, right? So if I evaluate that from 0 to 3, it should be (1/3)*(3)^3 minus (1/3)*(0)^3. That simplifies to (1/3)*27, which is 9. So λ equals 9. Got that down.Now, the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence with all positive terms. I know that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, let's call it q. So, a_n = a_1 * q^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term. Since all terms are positive, q must be positive as well.The expression we need to minimize is (a_4 + λa_2) divided by a_3. Let me write that out:(a_4 + λa_2) / a_3Since it's a geometric sequence, I can express each term in terms of a_1 and q. Let's do that:a_4 = a_1 * q^(4-1) = a_1 * q^3a_2 = a_1 * q^(2-1) = a_1 * qa_3 = a_1 * q^(3-1) = a_1 * q^2Substituting these into the expression:(a_4 + λa_2) / a_3 = (a_1 * q^3 + λ * a_1 * q) / (a_1 * q^2)I notice that a_1 is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, so I can cancel that out:= (q^3 + λ * q) / q^2Now, let's plug in the value of λ which we found earlier, which is 9:= (q^3 + 9q) / q^2I can simplify this further by dividing each term in the numerator by q^2:= q + 9/qSo now the expression simplifies to q + 9/q. We need to find the minimum value of this expression with respect to q, given that q is positive.Hmm, how do I find the minimum of q + 9/q? I think this is a classic optimization problem. Maybe I can use calculus or perhaps the AM-GM inequality.Let me try the AM-GM inequality first because it might be quicker. The AM-GM inequality states that for any two positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, for the two terms q and 9/q:(q + 9/q) / 2 ≥ sqrt(q * 9/q)Simplifying the right side:sqrt(q * 9/q) = sqrt(9) = 3Multiplying both sides by 2:q + 9/q ≥ 6So, the minimum value of q + 9/q is 6, and this occurs when q = 9/q, which implies q^2 = 9, so q = 3 (since q is positive).Alternatively, if I use calculus, I can take the derivative of the function f(q) = q + 9/q and set it equal to zero to find the critical points.f(q) = q + 9/qf'(q) = 1 - 9/q^2Setting f'(q) = 0:1 - 9/q^2 = 01 = 9/q^2q^2 = 9q = 3 (since q > 0)Then, plugging q = 3 back into f(q):f(3) = 3 + 9/3 = 3 + 3 = 6So, either way, whether I use the AM-GM inequality or calculus, I find that the minimum value is 6 when q = 3.Therefore, the minimum value of (a_4 + λa_2)/a_3 is 6.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Convert the binary number 1101 to decimal.

Factorial means multiplying all positive integers up to that number, so:[10! = 10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1]But wait, I also have (5!) in the denominator, which is:[5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120]So the denominator is (5! times 5! = 120 times 120 = 14400). Hmm, that seems a bit large. Maybe there's a way to simplify before multiplying everything out.Looking back at the formula:[frac{10!}{5! times 5!}]I can write (10!) as (10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5!), because (10! = 10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5!). So substituting that in, we get:[frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5!}{5! times 5!}]Now, the (5!) in the numerator and one (5!) in the denominator cancel out, leaving:[frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{5!}]Since (5! = 120), this becomes:[frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{120}]Now, let's compute the numerator:10 multiplied by 9 is 90.90 multiplied by 8 is 720.720 multiplied by 7 is 5040.5040 multiplied by 6 is 30240.So the numerator is 30240.Now, divide that by 120:30240 divided by 120.Hmm, let's do that step by step.First, 30240 divided by 10 is 3024.Then, 3024 divided by 12 is 252.So, 30240 divided by 120 is 252.Therefore, (dbinom{10}{5}) is 252.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the numerator:10 × 9 = 9090 × 8 = 720720 × 7 = 50405040 × 6 = 30240Yes, that's correct.Denominator: 5! = 12030240 ÷ 120: Let's see, 120 × 252 = 30240, so that's correct.Alternatively, I can simplify the fraction before multiplying everything out to make the calculation easier.Starting with:[frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1}]Which is the same as:[frac{10}{5} times frac{9}{3} times frac{8}{4} times frac{7}{1} times frac{6}{2}]Simplifying each fraction:10 ÷ 5 = 29 ÷ 3 = 38 ÷ 4 = 27 ÷ 1 = 76 ÷ 2 = 3So now we have:2 × 3 × 2 × 7 × 3Multiplying these together:2 × 3 = 66 × 2 = 1212 × 7 = 8484 × 3 = 252Same result, so that confirms it.I think that's solid. So, (dbinom{10}{5}) equals 252."},{"question":"For a positive integer ( n ), sort its positive divisors as ( 1 = d_1 < d_2 < cdots < d_k = n ). Find all positive integers ( n ) that are divisible by 2019 and satisfy ( n = d_{19}d_{20} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all positive integers ( n ) that are divisible by 2019 and satisfy ( n = d_{19}d_{20} ), where ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ) are the ordered divisors of ( n ). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that 2019 is equal to ( 3 times 673 ). So, ( n ) must be divisible by both 3 and 673. That means 3 and 673 are prime factors of ( n ). Now, the condition ( n = d_{19}d_{20} ) suggests something about the number of divisors ( n ) has. If ( d_{19} ) and ( d_{20} ) are the 19th and 20th divisors respectively, then ( n ) must have at least 20 divisors. But actually, since ( d_{20} ) is the 20th divisor and ( n ) is the last one, ( n ) must have exactly 38 divisors because ( d_{19} ) and ( d_{20} ) multiply to give ( n ). Wait, is that right?Let me think. If ( n ) has ( k ) divisors, then ( d_1 = 1 ) and ( d_k = n ). If ( n = d_{19}d_{20} ), then ( d_{19} ) and ( d_{20} ) must be such that their product is ( n ). In the list of divisors, each divisor ( d_i ) pairs with ( d_{k+1-i} ) to give ( n ). So, if ( d_{19} times d_{20} = n ), that would mean ( d_{19} ) and ( d_{20} ) are paired divisors. But in that case, the number of divisors ( k ) should be such that ( 19 + 20 = k + 1 ), so ( k = 38 ). Therefore, ( n ) must have exactly 38 divisors.Okay, so ( n ) has 38 divisors. The number of divisors function, ( tau(n) ), is given by the product of one more than each exponent in the prime factorization of ( n ). So, if ( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ldots p_m^{a_m} ), then ( tau(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) ldots (a_m + 1) ). Given that ( tau(n) = 38 ), and 38 factors into ( 2 times 19 ). So, the exponents plus one in the prime factorization of ( n ) must multiply to 38. Therefore, the possible factorizations are:1. ( 38 = 38 times 1 )2. ( 38 = 19 times 2 )So, ( n ) can be of the form ( p^{37} ) or ( p^{18} q ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes. But since ( n ) must be divisible by 2019, which is ( 3 times 673 ), ( n ) must have both 3 and 673 as prime factors. Therefore, the form ( p^{37} ) is not possible because that would mean ( n ) has only one prime factor, but we need at least two. So, the only possible form is ( p^{18} q ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes, and both 3 and 673 must be among them.So, there are two cases:1. ( n = 3^{18} times 673 )2. ( n = 3 times 673^{18} )Now, I need to check if these forms satisfy the condition ( n = d_{19}d_{20} ).Let's start with the first case: ( n = 3^{18} times 673 ).The number of divisors is ( (18 + 1)(1 + 1) = 19 times 2 = 38 ), which matches. Now, let's list the divisors in order. The divisors will be of the form ( 3^a times 673^b ) where ( 0 leq a leq 18 ) and ( 0 leq b leq 1 ).So, the divisors can be listed as:- ( 1, 3, 3^2, 3^3, ldots, 3^{18}, 673, 3 times 673, 3^2 times 673, ldots, 3^{18} times 673 )Wait, but actually, the order isn't just by increasing powers of 3. Since 673 is a larger prime than 3, some of the divisors involving 673 will be larger than some pure powers of 3. So, the ordering is a bit more complicated.Let me think. The divisors can be split into two groups: those that are powers of 3 and those that are powers of 3 multiplied by 673. So, the first group is ( 1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{18} ) and the second group is ( 673, 3 times 673, 3^2 times 673, ldots, 3^{18} times 673 ).But when ordering all divisors, the second group will interleave with the first group. Specifically, each element of the second group is larger than the corresponding element of the first group because 673 is larger than 3. So, the order will be:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 3^2 )...19. ( 3^{18} )20. ( 673 )21. ( 3 times 673 )22. ( 3^2 times 673 )...38. ( 3^{18} times 673 )Wait, that can't be right because 673 is much larger than ( 3^{18} ). Actually, ( 3^{18} ) is a very large number, but 673 is just a prime. So, actually, ( 673 ) is less than ( 3^6 ) because ( 3^6 = 729 ), which is greater than 673. So, ( 673 ) is between ( 3^6 ) and ( 3^7 ).Therefore, the ordering of the divisors is more nuanced. Let me try to list them in order:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 3^2 = 9 )4. ( 3^3 = 27 )5. ( 3^4 = 81 )6. ( 3^5 = 243 )7. ( 3^6 = 729 )8. ( 673 )9. ( 3 times 673 = 2019 )10. ( 3^2 times 673 = 6057 )11. ( 3^3 times 673 = 18171 )12. ( 3^4 times 673 = 54513 )13. ( 3^5 times 673 = 163539 )14. ( 3^6 times 673 = 490617 )15. ( 3^7 = 2187 )16. ( 3^7 times 673 = 1471431 )17. ( 3^8 = 6561 )18. ( 3^8 times 673 = 4425213 )19. ( 3^9 = 19683 )20. ( 3^9 times 673 = 13235739 )...Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think differently.Since ( n = 3^{18} times 673 ), the number of divisors is 38. The middle of the list of divisors is around the 19th and 20th divisors. Since ( d_{19} times d_{20} = n ), these two divisors should be around the square root of ( n ). But ( n = 3^{18} times 673 ), so ( sqrt{n} = 3^9 times sqrt{673} ). Since ( sqrt{673} ) is approximately 25.94, which is less than ( 3^3 = 27 ). So, ( sqrt{n} ) is approximately ( 3^9 times 25.94 ), which is a very large number, but in terms of the ordering, the 19th and 20th divisors should be around this value.But listing all 38 divisors is tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula.In the case where ( n = p^{18} q ), the number of divisors is ( (18 + 1)(1 + 1) = 38 ). The divisors can be thought of as pairs ( (p^a, q p^{18 - a}) ) for ( a = 0 ) to ( 18 ). So, each pair multiplies to ( n ). Therefore, the 19th divisor from the start is ( p^{9} ), and the 20th divisor is ( q p^{9} ). So, their product is ( p^{18} q = n ). Wait, that seems to fit. So, in this case, ( d_{19} = 3^9 ) and ( d_{20} = 673 times 3^9 ). Therefore, ( d_{19} times d_{20} = 3^9 times 673 times 3^9 = 3^{18} times 673 = n ). So, this works.Similarly, for the other case where ( n = 3 times 673^{18} ), the number of divisors is also 38, since ( (1 + 1)(18 + 1) = 2 times 19 = 38 ). In this case, the divisors are of the form ( 3^a times 673^b ) where ( a = 0 ) or ( 1 ), and ( b = 0 ) to ( 18 ). So, the list of divisors will be:1. ( 1 )2. ( 673 )3. ( 673^2 )...19. ( 673^{18} )20. ( 3 )21. ( 3 times 673 )22. ( 3 times 673^2 )...38. ( 3 times 673^{18} )Wait, that can't be right because 3 is smaller than 673, so 3 should come before 673. So, actually, the correct ordering is:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 673 )4. ( 3 times 673 )5. ( 673^2 )6. ( 3 times 673^2 )7. ( 673^3 )8. ( 3 times 673^3 )...37. ( 673^{18} )38. ( 3 times 673^{18} )Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because 673 is larger than 3, so the order should be:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 673 )4. ( 3 times 673 )5. ( 673^2 )6. ( 3 times 673^2 )7. ( 673^3 )8. ( 3 times 673^3 )...37. ( 673^{18} )38. ( 3 times 673^{18} )But wait, 673 is larger than 3, so 673 comes after 3. Then, ( 673^2 ) is larger than ( 3 times 673 ), because ( 673^2 = 452,929 ) and ( 3 times 673 = 2,019 ). So, actually, the order is:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 673 )4. ( 3 times 673 )5. ( 673^2 )6. ( 3 times 673^2 )7. ( 673^3 )8. ( 3 times 673^3 )...37. ( 673^{18} )38. ( 3 times 673^{18} )But wait, that would mean the 19th and 20th divisors are ( 673^9 ) and ( 3 times 673^9 ). Let me check:The first two divisors are 1 and 3. Then, starting from 673, each pair is ( 673^k ) and ( 3 times 673^k ). So, the order is:1. ( 1 )2. ( 3 )3. ( 673 )4. ( 3 times 673 )5. ( 673^2 )6. ( 3 times 673^2 )...19. ( 673^9 )20. ( 3 times 673^9 )...37. ( 673^{18} )38. ( 3 times 673^{18} )Yes, that makes sense. So, ( d_{19} = 673^9 ) and ( d_{20} = 3 times 673^9 ). Their product is ( 673^9 times 3 times 673^9 = 3 times 673^{18} = n ). So, this also satisfies the condition.Therefore, both forms ( n = 3^{18} times 673 ) and ( n = 3 times 673^{18} ) satisfy the given conditions.I think that's all. So, the solutions are ( n = 3^{18} times 673 ) and ( n = 3 times 673^{18} )."},{"question":"Calculate the result of sin 5^{circ}cos 55^{circ}+cos 5^{circ}sin 55^{circ}.A: - frac {1}{2}B: frac {1}{2}C: - frac { sqrt {3}}{2}D: frac { sqrt {3}}{2}","answer":"First, I observe that the expression (sin 5^{circ}cos 55^{circ} + cos 5^{circ}sin 55^{circ}) resembles the sine addition formula, which states that (sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B).Applying this formula to the given expression, I can rewrite it as:[sin(5^{circ} + 55^{circ}) = sin(60^{circ})]Next, I recall that (sin(60^{circ})) is a known value from the unit circle:[sin(60^{circ}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Therefore, the value of the original expression is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), which corresponds to option D."},{"question":"Five students are lined up in a row, with students A and B not adjacent to each other.

Treat A and B as a single entity, reducing the problem to arranging 4 entities (the AB pair and the other three students). The number of ways to arrange these 4 entities is (4! = 24).

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.It says: Given that π/2 < α < π and sin(α + π/6) = 3/5, find the value of cos(α - π/6). The options are A: (-4 - 3√3)/10, B: (4 + 3√3)/10, C: (4 - 3√3)/10, and D: (3√3 - 4)/10.Alright, so I need to find cos(α - π/6) given that sin(α + π/6) = 3/5 and α is in the second quadrant, between π/2 and π.First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. Since I'm dealing with angles that are sums and differences, maybe the cosine of a difference identity will be useful. The identity is:cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin BSo, if I let A be α + π/6 and B be π/3, then:cos((α + π/6) - π/3) = cos(α - π/6)Wait, let me check that. If I subtract π/3 from α + π/6, that would be α + π/6 - π/3. Simplifying that, π/6 is 30 degrees, π/3 is 60 degrees, so 30 - 60 is -30 degrees, which is -π/6. So, actually, cos(α - π/6) is equal to cos((α + π/6) - π/3). Hmm, that seems a bit convoluted, but maybe it's the right approach.Alternatively, maybe I can express cos(α - π/6) directly using the identity without substitution. Let me think.But before I get too deep into that, maybe I should figure out what cos(α + π/6) is, since I know sin(α + π/6) = 3/5. Because if I can find cos(α + π/6), then I can use that in the identity for cos(α - π/6).So, let's start by finding cos(α + π/6). Since sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1, I can solve for cos θ.Given sin(α + π/6) = 3/5, so sin^2(α + π/6) = (3/5)^2 = 9/25. Therefore, cos^2(α + π/6) = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25. So, cos(α + π/6) is either 4/5 or -4/5.Now, I need to determine the sign of cos(α + π/6). To do that, I should figure out in which quadrant α + π/6 lies.Given that α is between π/2 and π, adding π/6 to α would place α + π/6 between π/2 + π/6 and π + π/6. Let's compute those:π/2 is 3π/6, so 3π/6 + π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3.π is 6π/6, so 6π/6 + π/6 = 7π/6.So, α + π/6 is between 2π/3 and 7π/6. 2π/3 is 120 degrees, and 7π/6 is 210 degrees. So, α + π/6 is in the second or third quadrant.In the second quadrant, cosine is negative, and in the third quadrant, cosine is also negative. So, regardless of whether α + π/6 is in the second or third quadrant, cos(α + π/6) is negative. Therefore, cos(α + π/6) = -4/5.Alright, so now I know both sin(α + π/6) and cos(α + π/6). Let me write that down:sin(α + π/6) = 3/5cos(α + π/6) = -4/5Now, I need to find cos(α - π/6). As I thought earlier, maybe I can use the cosine of a difference identity. Let me write that identity again:cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin BBut in this case, if I let A = α and B = π/6, then:cos(α - π/6) = cos α cos(π/6) + sin α sin(π/6)Hmm, but I don't know cos α or sin α directly. I only know sin(α + π/6) and cos(α + π/6). Maybe I can express cos α and sin α in terms of sin(α + π/6) and cos(α + π/6).Alternatively, maybe I can express cos(α - π/6) in terms of cos(α + π/6) and some other angle. Let me think.Wait, earlier I thought about expressing α - π/6 as (α + π/6) - π/3. Let me verify that:(α + π/6) - π/3 = α + π/6 - 2π/6 = α - π/6. Yes, that's correct.So, cos(α - π/6) = cos((α + π/6) - π/3)Now, using the cosine of a difference identity again, but this time with angles (α + π/6) and π/3:cos((α + π/6) - π/3) = cos(α + π/6) cos(π/3) + sin(α + π/6) sin(π/3)Okay, that seems promising because I already know cos(α + π/6) and sin(α + π/6), and I know the exact values for cos(π/3) and sin(π/3).Let me recall those values:cos(π/3) = 1/2sin(π/3) = √3/2So, substituting the known values into the identity:cos(α - π/6) = cos(α + π/6) * (1/2) + sin(α + π/6) * (√3/2)Plugging in the values:cos(α - π/6) = (-4/5) * (1/2) + (3/5) * (√3/2)Let me compute each term separately.First term: (-4/5) * (1/2) = (-4)/10 = -2/5Second term: (3/5) * (√3/2) = (3√3)/10So, adding these two terms together:cos(α - π/6) = (-2/5) + (3√3)/10To combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 5 and 10, so 10 is the common denominator.Convert -2/5 to -4/10:cos(α - π/6) = (-4/10) + (3√3)/10 = (3√3 - 4)/10So, cos(α - π/6) equals (3√3 - 4)/10.Looking back at the options, that's option D.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found cos(α + π/6) by using sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1. Since sin(α + π/6) = 3/5, cos^2(α + π/6) = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25, so cos(α + π/6) is ±4/5. Then, I determined that α + π/6 is between 2π/3 and 7π/6, which are in the second and third quadrants where cosine is negative, so cos(α + π/6) = -4/5. That seems correct.2. Then, I used the identity cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B, but I expressed α - π/6 as (α + π/6) - π/3, which is correct because π/6 - π/3 = -π/6, so α + π/6 - π/3 = α - π/6.3. Substituted into the identity: cos((α + π/6) - π/3) = cos(α + π/6) cos(π/3) + sin(α + π/6) sin(π/3). That's correct.4. Plugged in the known values: cos(α + π/6) = -4/5, sin(α + π/6) = 3/5, cos(π/3) = 1/2, sin(π/3) = √3/2. That's all correct.5. Calculated each term: (-4/5)(1/2) = -2/5, (3/5)(√3/2) = (3√3)/10. Then converted -2/5 to -4/10 to combine with (3√3)/10, resulting in (3√3 - 4)/10. That seems correct.So, all steps check out, and the answer is option D: (3√3 - 4)/10.I think that's solid.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, it's helpful to look at its prime factorization. So, let's start by finding the prime factors of 1,000,000.I know that 1,000,000 is the same as 10^6. And 10 is 2 times 5, so 10^6 is (2*5)^6. Using exponent rules, that becomes 2^6 * 5^6. So, the prime factorization of 1,000,000 is 2 raised to the 6th power times 5 raised to the 6th power.Now, to find the total number of divisors, I remember that if a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b, then the total number of divisors is (a+1)*(b+1). Applying that here, the total number of divisors of 1,000,000 would be (6+1)*(6+1) = 7*7 = 49. So, there are 49 divisors in total.But the question asks specifically for divisors that do not end in 0. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many of these 49 divisors do not end with a 0.I think a number that ends with 0 must be divisible by 10, right? And 10 is 2*5, so any number that is a multiple of both 2 and 5 will end with 0. Therefore, to find divisors that do not end with 0, I need to exclude those divisors that are multiples of both 2 and 5.So, how do I find the number of divisors that are multiples of both 2 and 5? Well, if a divisor is a multiple of both 2 and 5, then in its prime factorization, it must have at least one 2 and at least one 5. So, in terms of exponents, for the prime factors 2 and 5, the exponents must be at least 1.Given that the original number is 2^6 * 5^6, the exponents for 2 in such divisors would range from 1 to 6, and similarly for 5, they would range from 1 to 6. So, the number of such divisors would be (6-1+1)*(6-1+1) = 6*6 = 36.Wait, that doesn't seem right. If I subtract 36 from the total number of divisors, which is 49, I get 13. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should think differently.Perhaps instead of subtracting the number of divisors that end with 0 from the total, I should directly count the number of divisors that do not end with 0. So, how can I ensure that a divisor does not end with 0?As I thought earlier, a number ending with 0 must be divisible by 10, which is 2*5. So, to avoid ending with 0, a number must not be divisible by both 2 and 5 simultaneously. That means either it is not divisible by 2, or it is not divisible by 5, or neither.But wait, actually, to ensure that a number does not end with 0, it must not be divisible by 10. So, it can be divisible by 2 or by 5, but not both. Or, it can be divisible by neither.So, to count the number of divisors not ending with 0, I need to count the divisors that are either not divisible by 2, or not divisible by 5, or neither.But actually, that might be more complicated. Maybe a better approach is to realize that a number not ending with 0 must not have both 2 and 5 as factors. So, in other words, it can have 2 as a factor, or 5 as a factor, or neither, but not both.Therefore, to count these divisors, I can consider two cases:1. Divisors that are powers of 2 only.2. Divisors that are powers of 5 only.3. Divisors that are 1 (which is neither a power of 2 nor a power of 5).Wait, actually, 1 is already included in both cases when the exponent is 0. So, maybe I need to be careful not to double-count.Let me think again. If I consider all divisors that are powers of 2, that would be 2^0, 2^1, ..., up to 2^6. That's 7 divisors.Similarly, all divisors that are powers of 5 would be 5^0, 5^1, ..., up to 5^6. That's another 7 divisors.But wait, 1 is included in both of these sets, right? Because 2^0 is 1 and 5^0 is also 1. So, if I just add these two sets together, I would be counting 1 twice. Therefore, to get the correct total, I should add the number of divisors that are powers of 2, add the number of divisors that are powers of 5, and then subtract 1 to account for the double-counting of 1.So, that would be 7 (powers of 2) + 7 (powers of 5) - 1 (for the overlap) = 13.Therefore, there are 13 divisors of 1,000,000 that do not end in 0.Wait, but earlier I thought about subtracting the number of divisors that end with 0 from the total. Let me check if that gives the same result.Total number of divisors is 49. Number of divisors that end with 0 is 36, as I calculated before. So, 49 - 36 = 13. That matches the previous result.So, both methods give me 13. That seems consistent.But just to be thorough, let me list out some of these divisors to make sure.Divisors that are powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.Divisors that are powers of 5: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625.Combined, these are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 16, 25, 32, 64, 125, 3125, 625, 15625.Wait, that's 13 divisors. Perfect, that matches my earlier calculation.So, it seems that the number of natural numbers that are divisors of 1,000,000 and do not end in 0 is indeed 13."},{"question":"A rectangle is called super cool if the number of square units in its area equals three times the number of units in its perimeter. This rectangle must also have integer side lengths. What is the sum of all different possible areas of super cool rectangles?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a super cool rectangle. The definition says that the area of the rectangle equals three times its perimeter, and both the side lengths are integers. I need to find all such rectangles and then sum up their different possible areas. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me recall the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The area ( A ) is given by ( A = a times b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the sides. The perimeter ( P ) is calculated as ( P = 2(a + b) ). The problem states that the area is equal to three times the perimeter. So, mathematically, that would be:[ A = 3P ]Substituting the formulas, we get:[ a times b = 3 times 2(a + b) ]Simplifying the right side:[ ab = 6(a + b) ]Okay, so now I have the equation:[ ab = 6a + 6b ]I need to find integer solutions for ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy this equation.Let me rearrange the equation to make it easier to work with. I'll bring all terms to one side:[ ab - 6a - 6b = 0 ]Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). Maybe I can factor it somehow. I remember a technique called \\"Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\\" where you add a constant to both sides to make the equation factorable.Let me try that. If I add 36 to both sides:[ ab - 6a - 6b + 36 = 36 ]Now, let's see if I can factor the left side. It looks like:[ (a - 6)(b - 6) = 36 ]Yes! That worked out. So, now the equation is:[ (a - 6)(b - 6) = 36 ]This means that ( (a - 6) ) and ( (b - 6) ) are positive integers that multiply to 36. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are side lengths, they must be positive integers greater than 6 (because ( a - 6 ) and ( b - 6 ) have to be positive). Now, I need to find all pairs of positive integers ( (x, y) ) such that ( x times y = 36 ). Each pair ( (x, y) ) will correspond to ( (a - 6, b - 6) ), so ( a = x + 6 ) and ( b = y + 6 ).Let me list all the factor pairs of 36:1. ( 1 times 36 )2. ( 2 times 18 )3. ( 3 times 12 )4. ( 4 times 9 )5. ( 6 times 6 )6. ( 9 times 4 )7. ( 12 times 3 )8. ( 18 times 2 )9. ( 36 times 1 )Wait, but some of these might result in the same rectangle, just with sides swapped. Since a rectangle with sides ( a ) and ( b ) is the same as one with sides ( b ) and ( a ), I should consider only unique pairs to avoid counting the same area twice.So, let's consider only the pairs where ( x leq y ) to ensure uniqueness:1. ( 1 times 36 )2. ( 2 times 18 )3. ( 3 times 12 )4. ( 4 times 9 )5. ( 6 times 6 )Now, for each of these pairs, I'll calculate ( a ) and ( b ), then compute the area ( ab ).1. For ( (1, 36) ):   - ( a = 1 + 6 = 7 )   - ( b = 36 + 6 = 42 )   - Area ( = 7 times 42 = 294 )2. For ( (2, 18) ):   - ( a = 2 + 6 = 8 )   - ( b = 18 + 6 = 24 )   - Area ( = 8 times 24 = 192 )3. For ( (3, 12) ):   - ( a = 3 + 6 = 9 )   - ( b = 12 + 6 = 18 )   - Area ( = 9 times 18 = 162 )4. For ( (4, 9) ):   - ( a = 4 + 6 = 10 )   - ( b = 9 + 6 = 15 )   - Area ( = 10 times 15 = 150 )5. For ( (6, 6) ):   - ( a = 6 + 6 = 12 )   - ( b = 6 + 6 = 12 )   - Area ( = 12 times 12 = 144 )So, the areas I've calculated are 294, 192, 162, 150, and 144. These are all different, so I don't need to worry about duplicates.Now, the problem asks for the sum of all different possible areas. So, I need to add these areas together:[ 294 + 192 + 162 + 150 + 144 ]Let me compute this step by step:- First, add 294 and 192:  [ 294 + 192 = 486 ]- Next, add 162:  [ 486 + 162 = 648 ]- Then, add 150:  [ 648 + 150 = 798 ]- Finally, add 144:  [ 798 + 144 = 942 ]So, the sum of all different possible areas of super cool rectangles is 942.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the areas:- 294, 192, 162, 150, 144.Adding them up:- 294 + 192: 294 + 192 is indeed 486.- 486 + 162: 486 + 162 is 648.- 648 + 150: 648 + 150 is 798.- 798 + 144: 798 + 144 is 942.Yes, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, let me verify one of the rectangles to ensure that it satisfies the original condition.Take the rectangle with sides 7 and 42:- Area: 7 * 42 = 294- Perimeter: 2*(7 + 42) = 2*49 = 98- Three times the perimeter: 3*98 = 294Yes, that matches the area.Another one: sides 12 and 12 (a square):- Area: 12*12 = 144- Perimeter: 2*(12 + 12) = 48- Three times the perimeter: 3*48 = 144That also matches.Okay, so my calculations seem correct. All the areas satisfy the condition, and the sum is indeed 942.**Final Answer**The sum of all different possible areas of super cool rectangles is boxed{942}."},{"question":"Anne, Bronwyn, and Carl ran a race.

(175 text{ m})","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Anne, Bronwyn, and Carl ran a race. They all started at the same time, and their speeds were constant throughout the race. When Anne finished, Bronwyn had 15 meters left to run, and Carl had 35 meters left. Then, when Bronwyn finished, Carl had 22 meters left. I need to find out the length of the race.Hmm, let's break this down. Since their speeds are constant, the distances they cover in the same amount of time should be proportional to their speeds. So, when Anne finishes the race, the distances that Bronwyn and Carl have left can help me figure out their speeds relative to Anne's speed.Let me denote the length of the race as ( x ) meters. When Anne finishes the race, she has run ( x ) meters. At that same moment, Bronwyn has run ( x - 15 ) meters, and Carl has run ( x - 35 ) meters. So, the distances they've covered when Anne finishes are ( x - 15 ) for Bronwyn and ( x - 35 ) for Carl.Now, when Bronwyn finishes the race, she has run the remaining 15 meters. At that point, Carl has 22 meters left. So, the time it takes Bronwyn to run those last 15 meters is the same time it takes Carl to run ( 35 - 22 = 13 ) meters. Wait, let me think about that again. When Anne finishes, Carl has 35 meters left. When Bronwyn finishes, Carl has 22 meters left. So, the difference in the distance Carl has left when Anne finishes and when Bronwyn finishes is ( 35 - 22 = 13 ) meters. That means Carl ran 13 meters in the time it took Bronwyn to run her last 15 meters.Since their speeds are constant, the ratio of the distances they cover in the same time should be equal to the ratio of their speeds. So, the ratio of Carl's speed to Bronwyn's speed is ( frac{13}{15} ).Now, let's relate this to when Anne finishes the race. At that point, Bronwyn has run ( x - 15 ) meters, and Carl has run ( x - 35 ) meters. The ratio of the distances they've covered is ( frac{x - 35}{x - 15} ). But we know that the ratio of their speeds is ( frac{13}{15} ), so:[frac{x - 35}{x - 15} = frac{13}{15}]Now, I can solve this equation for ( x ). Cross-multiplying gives:[15(x - 35) = 13(x - 15)]Expanding both sides:[15x - 525 = 13x - 195]Subtracting ( 13x ) from both sides:[2x - 525 = -195]Adding 525 to both sides:[2x = 330]Dividing both sides by 2:[x = 165]So, the length of the race is 165 meters. Let me double-check to make sure this makes sense.If the race is 165 meters, then when Anne finishes, Bronwyn has 15 meters left, so she has run ( 165 - 15 = 150 ) meters. Carl has 35 meters left, so he has run ( 165 - 35 = 130 ) meters.The ratio of Carl's distance to Bronwyn's distance at that point is ( frac{130}{150} = frac{13}{15} ), which matches the ratio of their speeds. Then, when Bronwyn finishes the remaining 15 meters, Carl runs 13 meters, leaving him with ( 35 - 13 = 22 ) meters, which matches the problem statement. Everything checks out, so I'm confident the answer is 165 meters."},{"question":"Given A={-2,2,3,4}, and B={x|x=t^{2},tin A}, express B= ______ using the roster method.","answer":"First, I need to understand the given sets and the relationship between them. Set ( A ) is defined as ( {-2, 2, 3, 4} ), and set ( B ) is defined as ( {x mid x = t^2, t in A} ). This means that every element in set ( B ) is the square of an element in set ( A ).Next, I will calculate the square of each element in set ( A ):- For ( t = -2 ), ( x = (-2)^2 = 4 ).- For ( t = 2 ), ( x = 2^2 = 4 ).- For ( t = 3 ), ( x = 3^2 = 9 ).- For ( t = 4 ), ( x = 4^2 = 16 ).Now, I will compile these results into set ( B ). Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, even though both ( -2 ) and ( 2 ) result in ( 4 ), I will only include ( 4 ) once in set ( B ).Therefore, the elements of set ( B ) are ( 4 ), ( 9 ), and ( 16 )."},{"question":" Consider non-negative real numbers  a, b, c  satisfying the condition  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2  . Find the maximum value of the following expression    P=frac{sqrt{b^2+c^2}}{3-a}+frac{sqrt{c^2+a^2}}{3-b}+a+b-2022c   ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the expression ( P = frac{sqrt{b^2 + c^2}}{3 - a} + frac{sqrt{c^2 + a^2}}{3 - b} + a + b - 2022c ) given that ( a, b, c ) are non-negative real numbers satisfying ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2 ). First, I should probably understand each part of the expression. The first two terms involve square roots and denominators, which makes them a bit tricky. The last three terms are linear in ( a, b, c ), but the coefficient of ( c ) is very large and negative, which might mean that ( c ) should be as small as possible to maximize ( P ).Since ( a, b, c ) are non-negative and their squares sum to 2, each of them is at most ( sqrt{2} ). That might be useful later.I notice that the expression ( sqrt{b^2 + c^2} ) is the same as ( sqrt{2 - a^2} ) because ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2 ). Similarly, ( sqrt{c^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2 - b^2} ). So, I can rewrite ( P ) as:[P = frac{sqrt{2 - a^2}}{3 - a} + frac{sqrt{2 - b^2}}{3 - b} + a + b - 2022c]That seems a bit simpler. Now, I need to maximize this expression. Since ( c ) has a large negative coefficient, it's beneficial to minimize ( c ). The smallest ( c ) can be is 0, given that ( c ) is non-negative. So, maybe setting ( c = 0 ) will help maximize ( P ).If ( c = 0 ), then the condition becomes ( a^2 + b^2 = 2 ). So, ( P ) simplifies to:[P = frac{sqrt{2 - a^2}}{3 - a} + frac{sqrt{2 - b^2}}{3 - b} + a + b]Now, I need to maximize this expression with ( a^2 + b^2 = 2 ). It's symmetric in ( a ) and ( b ), so maybe the maximum occurs when ( a = b ). Let me test that.If ( a = b ), then ( 2a^2 = 2 ) which implies ( a^2 = 1 ), so ( a = 1 ) (since ( a ) is non-negative). Therefore, ( a = b = 1 ).Plugging these into ( P ):[P = frac{sqrt{2 - 1}}{3 - 1} + frac{sqrt{2 - 1}}{3 - 1} + 1 + 1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + 1 + 1 = 1 + 2 = 3]So, ( P = 3 ) when ( a = b = 1 ) and ( c = 0 ). Is this the maximum?I should check if there are other values of ( a ) and ( b ) that might give a higher ( P ). Let's consider if ( a ) is larger than 1. Suppose ( a = sqrt{2} ), then ( b = 0 ). Plugging into ( P ):[P = frac{sqrt{2 - 2}}{3 - sqrt{2}} + frac{sqrt{2 - 0}}{3 - 0} + sqrt{2} + 0 = 0 + frac{sqrt{2}}{3} + sqrt{2} approx 0 + 0.471 + 1.414 = 1.885]That's less than 3. What if ( a ) is slightly larger than 1, say ( a = 1.1 ). Then ( b = sqrt{2 - 1.21} = sqrt{0.79} approx 0.89 ).Compute each term:First term: ( frac{sqrt{2 - (1.1)^2}}{3 - 1.1} = frac{sqrt{2 - 1.21}}{1.9} = frac{sqrt{0.79}}{1.9} approx frac{0.89}{1.9} approx 0.47 )Second term: ( frac{sqrt{2 - (0.89)^2}}{3 - 0.89} = frac{sqrt{2 - 0.79}}{2.11} = frac{sqrt{1.21}}{2.11} = frac{1.1}{2.11} approx 0.52 )Third term: ( a + b = 1.1 + 0.89 = 1.99 )So total ( P approx 0.47 + 0.52 + 1.99 = 2.98 ), which is still less than 3.What if ( a = 0.5 ), then ( b = sqrt{2 - 0.25} = sqrt{1.75} approx 1.322 ).Compute each term:First term: ( frac{sqrt{2 - 0.25}}{3 - 0.5} = frac{sqrt{1.75}}{2.5} approx frac{1.322}{2.5} approx 0.529 )Second term: ( frac{sqrt{2 - (1.322)^2}}{3 - 1.322} = frac{sqrt{2 - 1.748}}{1.678} = frac{sqrt{0.252}}{1.678} approx frac{0.502}{1.678} approx 0.30 )Third term: ( a + b = 0.5 + 1.322 = 1.822 )Total ( P approx 0.529 + 0.30 + 1.822 = 2.651 ), still less than 3.Hmm, so when ( a = b = 1 ), ( P = 3 ). When I tried other values, ( P ) was less. Maybe 3 is indeed the maximum.But wait, I should also check if ( c ) can be non-zero and still give a higher ( P ). Since ( c ) has a large negative coefficient, increasing ( c ) would decrease ( P ). So, to maximize ( P ), we should set ( c = 0 ). Therefore, the maximum occurs when ( c = 0 ), and ( a = b = 1 ).Let me confirm this by considering the partial derivatives, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can think about the behavior of the function.The terms ( frac{sqrt{2 - a^2}}{3 - a} ) and ( frac{sqrt{2 - b^2}}{3 - b} ) are both maximized when ( a ) and ( b ) are as large as possible, but they are constrained by ( a^2 + b^2 = 2 ). The linear terms ( a + b ) are also maximized when ( a ) and ( b ) are as large as possible. However, the denominators ( 3 - a ) and ( 3 - b ) decrease as ( a ) and ( b ) increase, which might cause the fractions to decrease.So, there's a trade-off between the numerator and denominator. When ( a ) and ( b ) are 1, the fractions are ( frac{1}{2} ) each, which seems to be a good balance. If ( a ) or ( b ) increases beyond 1, the numerator increases but the denominator decreases, but the overall effect might not be enough to compensate for the decrease in the other term.Therefore, it's plausible that the maximum occurs at ( a = b = 1 ), ( c = 0 ), giving ( P = 3 ).I think I've considered different cases and the symmetry of the problem. It seems that ( P ) reaches its maximum value of 3 when ( a = b = 1 ) and ( c = 0 )."},{"question":"Given that m and n are two different lines, and alpha, beta, gamma are three different planes, which of the following statements is correct?

It involves lines and planes, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me go through each option one by one and see if I can understand why each is correct or not.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I have it right. We have two different lines, m and n, and three different planes, α, β, and γ. The question is asking which of the statements A, B, C, or D is correct.Starting with option A: \\"If α is perpendicular to γ, and α is perpendicular to β, then γ is parallel to β.\\" Hmm, okay. So if plane α is perpendicular to both γ and β, does that mean γ and β are parallel? I'm not sure. Let me visualize this. Imagine α is like the floor, and γ and β are walls. If both walls are perpendicular to the floor, does that mean the walls are parallel? Well, in a typical room, the walls are perpendicular to the floor but they meet at a corner, so they're not parallel. So, in that case, γ and β would intersect, not be parallel. So, that would mean statement A is not necessarily true. So, A is incorrect.Moving on to option B: \\"If m is parallel to n, m is contained in α, and n is contained in β, then α is parallel to β.\\" Hmm, okay. So, if two parallel lines are each lying on different planes, does that make the planes parallel? I think not necessarily. For example, imagine two parallel lines on the floor and on a wall. The floor and the wall are not parallel; they intersect along a line. So, even though the lines are parallel, the planes can intersect. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.Option C: \\"If m is parallel to n, and m is parallel to α, then n is parallel to α.\\" Hmm, so if two lines are parallel, and one is parallel to a plane, does the other have to be parallel too? Let me think. If m is parallel to α, that means m doesn't intersect α and lies outside of it. If n is parallel to m, then n should also not intersect α, right? But wait, could n lie on α? If n is parallel to m, which is parallel to α, could n be on α? I think yes. For example, imagine plane α is the floor, m is a line on the ceiling parallel to the floor, and n is a line on the floor. Then m is parallel to α, n is parallel to m, but n is on α, not parallel to it. So, in that case, n is not parallel to α, it's lying on α. So, statement C is incorrect because n could be on α instead of being parallel.Finally, option D: \\"If m is parallel to n, m is perpendicular to α, and n is perpendicular to β, then α is parallel to β.\\" Okay, so if two parallel lines are each perpendicular to different planes, does that make the planes parallel? Let me break this down. If m is perpendicular to α, that means m is a normal vector to α. Similarly, n is a normal vector to β. Since m is parallel to n, their direction vectors are the same. If two planes have parallel normal vectors, then the planes themselves must be parallel. That makes sense because the orientation of the planes is determined by their normals. If the normals are parallel, the planes can't intersect; they must be parallel. So, statement D seems correct.Wait, let me double-check. If m is perpendicular to α, then m is a normal vector of α. Similarly, n is a normal vector of β. Since m is parallel to n, their direction ratios are proportional, meaning the normals are scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, the planes α and β must be parallel. Yes, that seems right. So, D is correct.So, to recap:- A is incorrect because two planes perpendicular to the same plane can intersect.- B is incorrect because two parallel lines can lie on intersecting planes.- C is incorrect because a line parallel to another line on a plane can lie on that plane instead of being parallel.- D is correct because parallel lines perpendicular to two planes imply the planes are parallel.Therefore, the correct answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Solve the equations:<br/>(1)2x^{2}-x-6=0;<br/>(2)left(y-2right)^{2}=9y^{2}.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two equations to solve. Let's take them one at a time. The first one is a quadratic equation: 2x squared minus x minus 6 equals zero. Okay, quadratic equations usually have two solutions, so I need to find both of them. I remember that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Factoring seems like a good approach here because the coefficients aren't too big, and maybe it factors nicely.So, let's see. 2x squared minus x minus 6. I need to factor this into two binomials. The general form would be (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0. When I multiply that out, I get acx squared plus (ad + bc)x plus bd. Comparing that to 2x squared minus x minus 6, I can see that ac should be 2, and bd should be -6. Also, ad + bc should be -1.Let's think about possible factors. Since 2 is a prime number, the only way to get ac as 2 is to have a=2 and c=1, or a=1 and c=2. Let's try a=2 and c=1 first. Then, we need to find b and d such that bd = -6 and ad + bc = -1. So, with a=2 and c=1, that becomes 2d + b = -1. Also, bd = -6.So, let's list the pairs of integers that multiply to -6: (1, -6), (-1, 6), (2, -3), (-2, 3). Let's test these pairs to see which one satisfies 2d + b = -1.First pair: b=1, d=-6. Then 2*(-6) + 1 = -12 + 1 = -11, which is not -1.Second pair: b=-1, d=6. Then 2*6 + (-1) = 12 - 1 = 11, not -1.Third pair: b=2, d=-3. Then 2*(-3) + 2 = -6 + 2 = -4, not -1.Fourth pair: b=-2, d=3. Then 2*3 + (-2) = 6 - 2 = 4, not -1.Hmm, none of these worked. Maybe I should try a=1 and c=2 instead. So, a=1, c=2. Then, ad + bc = d + 2b = -1, and bd = -6.Again, let's list the pairs for bd=-6: (1, -6), (-1, 6), (2, -3), (-2, 3).First pair: b=1, d=-6. Then d + 2b = -6 + 2 = -4, not -1.Second pair: b=-1, d=6. Then d + 2b = 6 + (-2) = 4, not -1.Third pair: b=2, d=-3. Then d + 2b = -3 + 4 = 1, not -1.Fourth pair: b=-2, d=3. Then d + 2b = 3 + (-4) = -1. Oh, that works!So, b=-2 and d=3. Therefore, the factors are (1x - 2)(2x + 3) = 0. So, (x - 2)(2x + 3) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero:x - 2 = 0 => x = 22x + 3 = 0 => 2x = -3 => x = -3/2Okay, so the solutions for the first equation are x = 2 and x = -3/2.Now, moving on to the second equation: (y - 2)^2 = 9y^2.This looks like a quadratic equation as well, but it's already in a squared form. Maybe I can take square roots on both sides, but I have to remember that taking square roots introduces both positive and negative solutions.So, let's take the square root of both sides:sqrt((y - 2)^2) = sqrt(9y^2)Which simplifies to:|y - 2| = 3|y|Hmm, absolute values can complicate things a bit. Let's consider the two cases separately.Case 1: y - 2 = 3yCase 2: y - 2 = -3yLet's solve Case 1 first:y - 2 = 3ySubtract y from both sides:-2 = 2yDivide both sides by 2:y = -1Now, let's solve Case 2:y - 2 = -3yAdd 3y to both sides:4y - 2 = 0Add 2 to both sides:4y = 2Divide both sides by 4:y = 2/4 = 1/2So, the solutions for the second equation are y = -1 and y = 1/2.Wait a second, let me double-check these solutions to make sure they satisfy the original equation.For y = -1:Left side: (-1 - 2)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9Right side: 9*(-1)^2 = 9*1 = 9So, 9 = 9, which is correct.For y = 1/2:Left side: (1/2 - 2)^2 = (-3/2)^2 = 9/4Right side: 9*(1/2)^2 = 9*(1/4) = 9/4So, 9/4 = 9/4, which is also correct.Okay, so both solutions are valid.In summary, for the first equation, the solutions are x = 2 and x = -3/2, and for the second equation, the solutions are y = -1 and y = 1/2."},{"question":"Ella designed a rectangular sticker that is 4.5 inches wide and 3 inches tall. She needs to resize it for a promotional poster to be 13.5 inches wide. How tall will the sticker be if resized proportionately?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about resizing a sticker. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Ella has a rectangular sticker that's 4.5 inches wide and 3 inches tall. She wants to make it bigger for a promotional poster, and the new width needs to be 13.5 inches. The question is, how tall will the sticker be if she resizes it proportionately?Alright, so first, I need to figure out what \\"resizing proportionately\\" means. I think it means that the width and height are scaled by the same factor so that the shape stays the same, right? So, if she makes the width bigger, the height should also get bigger by the same amount to keep the sticker looking the same.Let me write down the original dimensions:- Original width: 4.5 inches- Original height: 3 inchesAnd the new width she wants is 13.5 inches. So, I need to find the new height that keeps the proportions the same.I remember that when scaling things proportionally, you can set up a ratio of the new dimension to the original dimension and make sure that ratio is the same for both width and height. So, if I let the new height be \\"h,\\" I can write the ratio for width and set it equal to the ratio for height.So, the ratio for width would be:New width / Original width = 13.5 / 4.5And the ratio for height would be:New height / Original height = h / 3Since the resizing is proportional, these two ratios should be equal. So, I can set them equal to each other:13.5 / 4.5 = h / 3Now, I need to solve for h. Let's compute 13.5 divided by 4.5 first. Hmm, 4.5 times 3 is 13.5, so 13.5 divided by 4.5 is 3. So, the ratio is 3.So, now I have:3 = h / 3To solve for h, I can multiply both sides by 3:3 * 3 = h9 = hSo, the new height should be 9 inches.Wait, let me double-check that. If the original width is 4.5 and the new width is 13.5, that's three times bigger. So, if the original height is 3 inches, three times bigger would be 9 inches. Yeah, that makes sense.I think I did it right. The scale factor is 3, so both width and height are multiplied by 3. Original width 4.5 * 3 = 13.5, which matches the desired width. Original height 3 * 3 = 9, so the new height should be 9 inches.I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The proportions are maintained, and the scale factor is consistent for both dimensions. So, I'm confident that the new height is 9 inches."},{"question":"Let  ABC  be an isosceles triangle in which  angle BAC=120^circ,   D  be the midpoint of  BC,   DE  be the altitude of triangle  ADC,  and  M  be the midpoint of  DE.  Prove that  BM=3AM. ","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to prove that BM is three times AM in this specific triangle setup. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.First, the triangle ABC is isosceles with angle BAC being 120 degrees. Since it's isosceles, sides AB and AC must be equal. Let me denote AB = AC = c, and BC = a. I think assigning some variables might help me later on.Now, D is the midpoint of BC. So, BD = DC = a/2. Since D is the midpoint, it should lie exactly halfway between B and C. That makes sense.Next, DE is the altitude of triangle ADC. So, DE is perpendicular to AC. Wait, no, DE is the altitude, so it should be perpendicular to the base of the triangle ADC. Hmm, triangle ADC has base DC, so DE must be perpendicular to DC? Or is it the altitude from D to AC? Wait, no, DE is the altitude of triangle ADC, so it should be from D to AC. So, DE is perpendicular to AC. That makes sense because in triangle ADC, DE is the altitude from D to AC.Wait, but AC is one of the equal sides of the original triangle ABC. So, AC is equal to AB, which is c. So, DE is the altitude from D to AC, which is a line segment from D perpendicular to AC, meeting AC at point E.Then, M is the midpoint of DE. So, once I have DE, M is halfway along that segment.I need to prove that BM = 3AM. So, BM is the length from B to M, and AM is the length from A to M. So, BM is three times as long as AM.Hmm, okay. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = c and angle BAC = 120 degrees, I can place point B at (c, 0). Then, point C should be somewhere in the plane such that AC = c and angle BAC is 120 degrees. To find the coordinates of C, I can use some trigonometry.In triangle ABC, with AB = AC = c and angle BAC = 120 degrees, the coordinates of C can be found using rotation. If I rotate point B around A by 120 degrees, I should get point C. The rotation matrix for 120 degrees is:[begin{pmatrix}cos 120^circ & -sin 120^circ sin 120^circ & cos 120^circend{pmatrix}]Which is:[begin{pmatrix}-1/2 & -sqrt{3}/2 sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2end{pmatrix}]Applying this to point B (c, 0):x' = c*(-1/2) - 0*(sqrt{3}/2) = -c/2y' = c*(sqrt{3}/2) + 0*(-1/2) = (csqrt{3})/2So, point C is at (-c/2, (csqrt{3})/2).Okay, so now I have coordinates for A, B, and C:A: (0, 0)B: (c, 0)C: (-c/2, (csqrt{3})/2)Now, D is the midpoint of BC. Let me find the coordinates of D.Midpoint formula: D_x = (B_x + C_x)/2, D_y = (B_y + C_y)/2So,D_x = (c + (-c/2))/2 = (c/2)/2 = c/4D_y = (0 + (csqrt{3}/2))/2 = (csqrt{3}/2)/2 = csqrt{3}/4So, D is at (c/4, csqrt{3}/4)Next, DE is the altitude of triangle ADC. So, DE is perpendicular to AC and meets AC at E.First, let me find the equation of AC to find where DE intersects it.Points A (0,0) and C (-c/2, csqrt{3}/2). The slope of AC is:m_AC = (csqrt{3}/2 - 0)/(-c/2 - 0) = (csqrt{3}/2)/(-c/2) = -sqrt{3}So, the equation of AC is y = -sqrt{3}xSince DE is perpendicular to AC, its slope is the negative reciprocal of -sqrt{3}, which is 1/sqrt{3}So, DE has slope 1/sqrt{3} and passes through D (c/4, csqrt{3}/4)Equation of DE: y - csqrt{3}/4 = (1/sqrt{3})(x - c/4)Now, find point E where DE intersects AC.AC: y = -sqrt{3}xDE: y = (1/sqrt{3})x + (csqrt{3}/4 - (1/sqrt{3})(c/4))Simplify DE equation:y = (1/sqrt{3})x + (csqrt{3}/4 - c/(4sqrt{3}))Let me combine the constants:csqrt{3}/4 - c/(4sqrt{3}) = c/(4sqrt{3})(3 - 1) = c/(4sqrt{3})*2 = c/(2sqrt{3})So, DE: y = (1/sqrt{3})x + c/(2sqrt{3})Now, set equal to AC: y = -sqrt{3}xSo,-sqrt{3}x = (1/sqrt{3})x + c/(2sqrt{3})Multiply both sides by sqrt{3} to eliminate denominators:-3x = x + c/2Bring x terms to left:-3x - x = c/2-4x = c/2x = -c/8Now, plug back into AC equation to find y:y = -sqrt{3}*(-c/8) = csqrt{3}/8So, point E is at (-c/8, csqrt{3}/8)Now, DE is the segment from D (c/4, csqrt{3}/4) to E (-c/8, csqrt{3}/8)Midpoint M of DE: average the coordinates.M_x = (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 = (2c/8 - c/8)/2 = (c/8)/2 = c/16Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, midpoint formula is (x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2.So,M_x = (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 = (2c/8 - c/8)/2 = (c/8)/2 = c/16M_y = (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 = (2csqrt{3}/8 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 = (3csqrt{3}/8)/2 = 3csqrt{3}/16Wait, but that seems too small. Let me double-check.Wait, no, midpoint is just ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, actually, no, midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, that's not correct. Midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, that's not correct. Midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, that's not correct. Midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, no, that's not correct. Midpoint is ( (c/4 + (-c/8))/2 , (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8)/2 )Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute M_x and M_y step by step.M_x = (c/4 + (-c/8)) / 2First, c/4 is 2c/8, so 2c/8 - c/8 = c/8Then, divide by 2: c/8 / 2 = c/16Similarly, M_y = (csqrt{3}/4 + csqrt{3}/8) / 2csqrt{3}/4 is 2csqrt{3}/8, so 2csqrt{3}/8 + csqrt{3}/8 = 3csqrt{3}/8Divide by 2: 3csqrt{3}/8 / 2 = 3csqrt{3}/16So, M is at (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)Wait, that seems correct. So, M is at (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)Now, I need to find BM and AM.First, let's find coordinates of B, M, and A.Point B is at (c, 0)Point M is at (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)Point A is at (0,0)So, vector AM is from A (0,0) to M (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)So, AM has components (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)Length AM = sqrt( (c/16)^2 + (3csqrt{3}/16)^2 )Similarly, BM is from B (c, 0) to M (c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)So, vector BM is (c/16 - c, 3csqrt{3}/16 - 0) = (-15c/16, 3csqrt{3}/16)Length BM = sqrt( (-15c/16)^2 + (3csqrt{3}/16)^2 )Let me compute AM first.AM^2 = (c/16)^2 + (3csqrt{3}/16)^2 = c²/256 + 27c²/256 = (1 + 27)c² / 256 = 28c² / 256 = 7c² / 64So, AM = sqrt(7c² / 64) = (c/8) sqrt(7)Now, BM^2 = (-15c/16)^2 + (3csqrt{3}/16)^2 = 225c²/256 + 27c²/256 = (225 + 27)c² / 256 = 252c² / 256 = 63c² / 64So, BM = sqrt(63c² / 64) = (c/8) sqrt(63) = (c/8) * 3 sqrt(7) = (3c/8) sqrt(7)So, BM = 3 * (c/8 sqrt(7)) = 3 AMTherefore, BM = 3 AMWait, that's exactly what we needed to prove! So, through coordinate geometry, assigning coordinates, finding midpoints, and computing distances, I arrived at BM being three times AM.I think this makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.1. Assigned coordinates correctly.2. Found D as midpoint of BC correctly.3. Found equation of AC correctly.4. Found slope of DE correctly as perpendicular to AC.5. Found equation of DE and solved for intersection E correctly.6. Found midpoint M correctly.7. Calculated distances AM and BM correctly, leading to BM = 3 AM.Yes, everything seems to check out.

What is the sum of the first 14 terms?A: 15B: 210C: 105D: 60","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\\"In the arithmetic sequence {aₙ}, a₇ and a₈ are the two roots of the quadratic equation x² - 15x + m = 0. What is the sum of the first 14 terms? The options are A: 15, B: 210, C: 105, D: 60.\\"Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term. So, if I denote the first term as a₁ and the common difference as d, then the nth term aₙ can be written as:aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)dSo, a₇ would be a₁ + 6d, and a₈ would be a₁ + 7d.Now, the problem states that a₇ and a₈ are the roots of the quadratic equation x² - 15x + m = 0. I recall that for a quadratic equation of the form x² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b, and the product is c. Wait, in this case, the equation is x² - 15x + m = 0, so comparing it to the standard form, b is -15, and c is m.So, the sum of the roots (a₇ + a₈) should be equal to -b, which in this case is 15. And the product of the roots (a₇ * a₈) should be equal to m.Let me write that down:a₇ + a₈ = 15a₇ * a₈ = mBut since we're dealing with an arithmetic sequence, maybe I can express a₇ and a₈ in terms of a₁ and d.As I wrote earlier:a₇ = a₁ + 6da₈ = a₁ + 7dSo, adding them together:a₇ + a₈ = (a₁ + 6d) + (a₁ + 7d) = 2a₁ + 13d = 15Hmm, so 2a₁ + 13d = 15. That's one equation.But I don't know the value of m, so maybe I don't need it. The question is asking for the sum of the first 14 terms.I remember that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:Sₙ = n/2 * (2a₁ + (n - 1)d)Alternatively, it can also be written as:Sₙ = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ)Since aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d.So, for n = 14, the sum S₁₄ would be:S₁₄ = 14/2 * (a₁ + a₁₄) = 7 * (a₁ + a₁₄)But a₁₄ is the 14th term, which is a₁ + 13d.So, S₁₄ = 7 * (a₁ + a₁ + 13d) = 7 * (2a₁ + 13d)Wait a minute, from earlier, I have 2a₁ + 13d = 15.So, substituting that into the sum:S₁₄ = 7 * 15 = 105So, the sum of the first 14 terms is 105, which is option C.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I correctly identified that a₇ and a₈ are roots, so their sum is 15.2. Expressed a₇ and a₈ in terms of a₁ and d, added them to get 2a₁ + 13d = 15.3. Remembered the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence and recognized that a₁ + a₁₄ is equal to 2a₁ + 13d, which is 15.4. Plugged that into the sum formula: 14/2 * 15 = 7 * 15 = 105.Everything seems to check out. So, I feel confident that the answer is 105.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory.

Let me first understand what each set represents.Set M is defined by the equation (x²)/9 + (y²)/4 = 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. I think that's the equation of an ellipse. Right, because the standard form of an ellipse is (x²)/a² + (y²)/b² = 1. So in this case, a² is 9 and b² is 4, which means a is 3 and b is 2. So, this ellipse is centered at the origin, stretching 3 units along the x-axis and 2 units along the y-axis.Set N is defined by the equation (x)/3 + (y)/2 = 1. That seems like a linear equation. Let me rearrange it to the slope-intercept form to better understand it. If I subtract (x)/3 from both sides, I get (y)/2 = 1 - (x)/3. Then, multiplying both sides by 2, I get y = 2 - (2x)/3. So, this is a straight line with a y-intercept at (0, 2) and a slope of -2/3.Now, I need to find M ∩ N, which means I need to find all the points that lie on both the ellipse and the line. In other words, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously.Let me write down the two equations:1. (x²)/9 + (y²)/4 = 12. y = 2 - (2x)/3Since the second equation is already solved for y, I can substitute this expression for y into the first equation. That way, I can solve for x first and then find the corresponding y values.Substituting y = 2 - (2x)/3 into the ellipse equation:(x²)/9 + [(2 - (2x)/3)²]/4 = 1Let me simplify this step by step.First, let's expand the squared term in the numerator:(2 - (2x)/3)² = 2² - 2*2*(2x)/3 + (2x/3)² = 4 - (8x)/3 + (4x²)/9So, substituting back into the equation:(x²)/9 + [4 - (8x)/3 + (4x²)/9]/4 = 1Now, let's simplify each term:First term: (x²)/9 remains as is.Second term: [4 - (8x)/3 + (4x²)/9]/4 can be broken down into three separate fractions:4/4 - (8x)/3 /4 + (4x²)/9 /4Which simplifies to:1 - (2x)/3 + (x²)/9So now, the entire equation becomes:(x²)/9 + 1 - (2x)/3 + (x²)/9 = 1Combine like terms:(x²)/9 + (x²)/9 = (2x²)/9So, the equation is now:(2x²)/9 - (2x)/3 + 1 = 1Subtract 1 from both sides:(2x²)/9 - (2x)/3 = 0Let's factor out common terms. I can factor out (2x)/9:(2x)/9 * (x - 3) = 0Wait, let me check that. If I factor out (2x)/9 from (2x²)/9 - (2x)/3, I get:(2x)/9 * x - (2x)/9 * 3 = (2x²)/9 - (6x)/9 = (2x²)/9 - (2x)/3Yes, that's correct. So, (2x)/9 * (x - 3) = 0Therefore, either (2x)/9 = 0 or (x - 3) = 0Solving these:1. (2x)/9 = 0 => x = 02. x - 3 = 0 => x = 3So, the x-values where the line intersects the ellipse are x = 0 and x = 3.Now, let's find the corresponding y-values using the equation of the line y = 2 - (2x)/3.For x = 0:y = 2 - (2*0)/3 = 2 - 0 = 2So, one point is (0, 2).For x = 3:y = 2 - (2*3)/3 = 2 - 2 = 0So, the other point is (3, 0).Therefore, the intersection points of the ellipse and the line are (0, 2) and (3, 0).Looking back at the options:A: ∅ (empty set) – Not correct, since we found two points.B: {(3,0), (0,2)} – This matches our findings.C: [-2, 2] – This is an interval for y-values, but the intersection is specific points, not an interval.D: [-3, 3] – Similarly, this is an interval for x-values, but again, the intersection is specific points.So, the correct answer should be option B.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Then f(x)= （ ）.A: e^{x+1}B: e^{x-1}C: e^{-x+1}D: e^{-x-1}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about functions and their graphs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\\"The graph of the function ( f(x) ) is translated 1 unit to the right, and the resulting graph is symmetric to the curve ( y = e^x ) with respect to the y-axis. Then ( f(x) = ) （ ）.\\"And the options are:A: ( e^{x+1} )B: ( e^{x-1} )C: ( e^{-x+1} )D: ( e^{-x-1} )Alright, so I need to find the original function ( f(x) ) such that when its graph is shifted 1 unit to the right, it becomes symmetric to ( y = e^x ) with respect to the y-axis.First, let me recall some basic concepts. Translating a graph to the right by 1 unit means replacing ( x ) with ( x - 1 ) in the function. So, if the original function is ( f(x) ), then shifting it 1 unit to the right would give me ( f(x - 1) ).Now, the resulting graph after this translation is symmetric to ( y = e^x ) with respect to the y-axis. Symmetry with respect to the y-axis means that if you reflect the graph over the y-axis, it remains unchanged. So, if a graph is symmetric to another graph with respect to the y-axis, they are mirror images of each other across the y-axis.Given that, if the translated graph ( f(x - 1) ) is symmetric to ( y = e^x ), then ( f(x - 1) ) must be the reflection of ( y = e^x ) across the y-axis. Reflecting ( y = e^x ) over the y-axis would replace ( x ) with ( -x ), giving ( y = e^{-x} ).So, putting it together, after translating ( f(x) ) 1 unit to the right, we get ( f(x - 1) = e^{-x} ).Now, to find ( f(x) ), I need to reverse the translation. Since ( f(x - 1) = e^{-x} ), replacing ( x ) with ( x + 1 ) in both sides would give me ( f(x) = e^{-(x + 1)} ). Simplifying that, it becomes ( f(x) = e^{-x - 1} ).Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I take ( f(x) = e^{-x - 1} ) and translate it 1 unit to the right, I replace ( x ) with ( x - 1 ), so I get ( f(x - 1) = e^{-(x - 1) - 1} = e^{-x + 1 - 1} = e^{-x} ). Yes, that's correct. So, ( f(x - 1) = e^{-x} ), which is indeed the reflection of ( y = e^x ) over the y-axis. Therefore, ( f(x) = e^{-x - 1} ), which is option D.Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up the translation direction. Translating to the right by 1 unit is ( f(x - 1) ), right? Because if you think about shifting the graph, to move it to the right, you subtract from ( x ). For example, ( f(x - h) ) shifts the graph ( h ) units to the right.Yes, that's correct. So, my earlier reasoning holds.Alternatively, I can think about it as starting from the translated function. If the translated function is ( e^{-x} ), then to get the original function, I need to shift it back 1 unit to the left. Shifting left by 1 unit would replace ( x ) with ( x + 1 ), so ( e^{-(x + 1)} ), which is ( e^{-x - 1} ). That's the same result as before.So, I feel confident that the correct answer is D: ( e^{-x - 1} ).**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Rotate the vector (begin{pmatrix} 1  3  2 end{pmatrix}) 180° about the origin and find the resulting vector given that the rotation processes through the x-axis.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to rotate a vector 180 degrees about the origin, and the rotation is supposed to process through the x-axis. The vector given is (begin{pmatrix} 1  3  2 end{pmatrix}). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, I remember that rotating a vector in 3D space can be a bit tricky because there are different axes to consider. In this case, the rotation is about the x-axis, so I guess that means the x-component will stay the same, and the other components will change. But wait, it's a 180-degree rotation, so maybe that affects things differently.Let me recall some basics about vector rotations. I know that a rotation in 3D can be represented using rotation matrices. For the x-axis, the rotation matrix for an angle (theta) is:[R_x(theta) = begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 0 & costheta & -sintheta 0 & sintheta & costhetaend{pmatrix}]Since we're rotating 180 degrees, (theta = 180^circ). I need to plug that into the matrix. I remember that (cos(180^circ) = -1) and (sin(180^circ) = 0). So substituting these values in, the rotation matrix becomes:[R_x(180^circ) = begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 0 & -1 & 0 0 & 0 & -1end{pmatrix}]Okay, so this matrix will rotate any vector 180 degrees about the x-axis. Now, I need to apply this matrix to the given vector (begin{pmatrix} 1  3  2 end{pmatrix}).Let me write down the multiplication:[begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 0 & -1 & 0 0 & 0 & -1end{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix}1 3 2end{pmatrix}]Multiplying these out, the first component is (1*1 + 0*3 + 0*2 = 1). The second component is (0*1 + (-1)*3 + 0*2 = -3). The third component is (0*1 + 0*3 + (-1)*2 = -2).So, the resulting vector after rotation is (begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  -2 end{pmatrix}). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.Hmm, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. When rotating 180 degrees about the x-axis, shouldn't both the y and z components be negated? Because a 180-degree rotation should flip the vector to the opposite direction in the y-z plane. So, starting from (begin{pmatrix} 1  3  2 end{pmatrix}), after rotation, it should be (begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  -2 end{pmatrix}). Yeah, that seems correct.But wait, the problem says the rotation \\"processes through the x-axis.\\" I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe it's just emphasizing that the rotation is about the x-axis, not through some other path. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.Let me visualize this. If I have a vector in 3D space, pointing in the positive x, positive y, and positive z direction. Rotating it 180 degrees about the x-axis should flip its direction in the y and z axes, but keep the x-component the same. So, yes, (begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  -2 end{pmatrix}) makes sense.But hold on, another thought: sometimes, rotations can be represented differently depending on the handedness of the coordinate system. But since we're dealing with a standard right-handed coordinate system, I think the rotation matrix I used is appropriate.Just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. If I think about the effect of a 180-degree rotation, it's equivalent to reflecting the vector through the x-axis. So, reflecting through the x-axis would invert the y and z components, which is exactly what the rotation matrix does.Therefore, I'm confident that the resulting vector after a 180-degree rotation about the x-axis is (begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  -2 end{pmatrix}).Wait a second, but in the initial problem statement, it says \\"rotate the vector... 180° about the origin and find the resulting vector given that the rotation processes through the x-axis.\\" I want to make sure that \\"processes through the x-axis\\" doesn't mean something else, like the rotation is happening along the x-axis as a path, but I think it's more likely referring to the axis of rotation.In any case, the standard interpretation is that rotating about the x-axis by 180 degrees would negate the y and z components, leaving the x-component unchanged. So, I think my answer is correct.Just to recap:1. Identify the rotation axis: x-axis.2. Determine the rotation angle: 180 degrees.3. Use the rotation matrix for x-axis by 180 degrees.4. Multiply the matrix by the original vector.5. The resulting vector is (begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  -2 end{pmatrix}).I don't see any errors in this reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"Five numbers, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, are drawn randomly and without replacement from the set {1, 2, 3, dots, 50}.

Let p be the probability that, after a suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions a_1 times a_2 times a_3 times a_4 can be enclosed in a box of dimensions b_1 times b_2 times b_3 times b_4, with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box. Compute p in lowest terms and determine the sum of the numerator and denominator.","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the probability that a brick with dimensions a1, a2, a3, a4 can fit inside a box with dimensions b1, b2, b3, b4 after suitable rotation. The numbers a1 to a4 are drawn from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 50}, and then the b1 to b4 are drawn from the remaining 46 numbers. First, I need to understand what it means for the brick to fit inside the box. Since we can rotate the brick, the order of the dimensions doesn't matter as long as each dimension of the brick is less than or equal to the corresponding dimension of the box when both are sorted in the same order. So, if I sort both sets of dimensions in ascending or descending order, each dimension of the brick must be less than or equal to the corresponding dimension of the box.Let me break it down step by step.1. **Understanding the Problem:**   - We have 50 numbers. We randomly select 4 numbers without replacement; these are the dimensions of the brick: a1, a2, a3, a4.   - Then, from the remaining 46 numbers, we randomly select another 4 numbers without replacement; these are the dimensions of the box: b1, b2, b3, b4.   - We need to find the probability that, after sorting both sets of dimensions, each dimension of the brick is less than or equal to the corresponding dimension of the box.2. **Sorting the Dimensions:**   - Without loss of generality, let's sort both the brick dimensions and the box dimensions in ascending order. So, we'll have a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4 and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ b3 ≤ b4.   - For the brick to fit inside the box, it must be true that a1 ≤ b1, a2 ≤ b2, a3 ≤ b3, and a4 ≤ b4.3. **Total Number of Ways to Choose Dimensions:**   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers for the brick from 50 is C(50, 4).   - After choosing the brick dimensions, the number of ways to choose the box dimensions from the remaining 46 numbers is C(46, 4).   - So, the total number of possible pairs (brick, box) is C(50, 4) * C(46, 4).4. **Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**   - We need to count how many pairs (brick, box) satisfy a1 ≤ b1, a2 ≤ b2, a3 ≤ b3, and a4 ≤ b4 after sorting both sets.   - This seems similar to a problem where we have two sets of numbers, and we want one set to be component-wise less than or equal to the other set after sorting.5. **Thinking About Combinatorial Arrangements:**   - If we consider all 8 numbers (4 brick and 4 box) together, there are C(50, 8) ways to choose them.   - Once we have these 8 numbers, we need to assign 4 of them to be the brick and the remaining 4 to be the box such that when both are sorted, each brick dimension is less than or equal to the corresponding box dimension.6. **Assigning Numbers to Brick and Box:**   - For the brick to fit inside the box, each of the smallest, second smallest, third smallest, and largest brick dimensions must be less than or equal to the corresponding box dimensions.   - This is equivalent to choosing 4 numbers out of the 8 to be the brick dimensions such that each brick dimension is less than or equal to the corresponding box dimension when both are sorted.7. **Using Combinatorial Arguments:**   - The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 8 such that each chosen number is less than or equal to the corresponding number in the remaining set is given by the number of 4-element subsets of an 8-element set where each element is less than or equal to its counterpart in the complementary subset.   - This is a classic combinatorial problem, and the number of such subsets is known to be C(8, 4) / 2^4, but I need to verify this.8. **Calculating the Number of Favorable Assignments:**   - Wait, actually, the number of ways to assign 4 numbers to the brick such that each brick number is less than or equal to the corresponding box number is equal to the number of 4-element subsets where each element is less than or equal to the corresponding element in the complementary subset.   - This is equivalent to the number of ways to interleave two sets of 4 numbers such that the brick numbers are all less than or equal to the box numbers in each position.9. **Using the Concept of Non-Crossing Partitions:**   - Alternatively, this can be thought of as the number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 8 such that when both sets are sorted, each brick number is less than or equal to the corresponding box number.   - This is similar to the number of non-crossing partitions or the number of ways to match elements without crossing, which is given by the Catalan numbers. However, I'm not sure if Catalan numbers apply here directly.10. **Re-examining the Problem:**    - Maybe a simpler approach is to realize that for each position i (from 1 to 4), the brick dimension ai must be less than or equal to the box dimension bi.    - Since both sets are sorted, this condition must hold for all i.    - Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose 4 numbers for the brick such that each is less than or equal to the corresponding box number when both are sorted.11. **Using Hypergeometric Distribution:**    - Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a hypergeometric distribution problem where we want the brick numbers to be less than or equal to the box numbers in each position.    - However, hypergeometric distribution typically deals with successes and failures without considering order, so this might not be directly applicable.12. **Considering All Possible Orderings:**    - Another approach is to consider all possible ways to interleave the 8 numbers and count how many interleavings satisfy the condition that the first 4 numbers (brick) are each less than or equal to the corresponding next 4 numbers (box).    - However, this seems complicated because the numbers are not necessarily consecutive or in any particular order.13. **Simplifying the Problem:**    - Maybe instead of thinking about all 8 numbers, I can think about the relative order of the brick and box numbers.    - For each of the 4 brick numbers, it must be less than or equal to the corresponding box number when both are sorted.    - This is similar to having two sets of 4 numbers each, and we want one set to stochastically dominate the other.14. **Using Probability Theory:**    - The probability that one set stochastically dominates another can be calculated using combinatorial methods.    - Specifically, the probability that one set is component-wise less than or equal to another set after sorting is given by the number of such pairs divided by the total number of pairs.15. **Calculating the Probability:**    - The total number of ways to choose 4 brick numbers and 4 box numbers from 50 is C(50, 4) * C(46, 4).    - The number of favorable pairs is the number of ways to choose 4 brick numbers such that each is less than or equal to the corresponding box number when both are sorted.    - This is equivalent to choosing 8 numbers from 50, then assigning the 4 smallest to the brick and the 4 largest to the box. However, this would only give one specific favorable case, but there might be more.16. **Realizing the Number of Favorable Cases:**    - Wait, actually, for each set of 8 numbers, there is exactly one way to assign 4 to the brick and 4 to the box such that each brick number is less than or equal to the corresponding box number. That is, assign the 4 smallest to the brick and the 4 largest to the box.    - Therefore, the number of favorable pairs is equal to the number of ways to choose 8 numbers from 50, which is C(50, 8).17. **Calculating the Probability:**    - So, the probability p is equal to the number of favorable pairs divided by the total number of pairs.    - Number of favorable pairs = C(50, 8).    - Total number of pairs = C(50, 4) * C(46, 4).    - Therefore, p = C(50, 8) / [C(50, 4) * C(46, 4)].18. **Simplifying the Expression:**    - Let's compute this expression.    - C(50, 8) = 50! / (8! * 42!).    - C(50, 4) = 50! / (4! * 46!).    - C(46, 4) = 46! / (4! * 42!).    - Therefore, C(50, 4) * C(46, 4) = [50! / (4! * 46!)] * [46! / (4! * 42!)] = 50! / (4! * 4! * 42!).    - So, p = [50! / (8! * 42!)] / [50! / (4! * 4! * 42!)] = (4! * 4!) / 8! = (24 * 24) / 40320 = 576 / 40320.19. **Simplifying the Fraction:**    - Simplify 576 / 40320.    - Divide numerator and denominator by 576: 576 ÷ 576 = 1, 40320 ÷ 576 = 70.    - So, p = 1 / 70.20. **Final Answer:**    - The probability p is 1/70.    - The sum of the numerator and denominator is 1 + 70 = 71."},{"question":"A certain number less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, I remember that there's a tangent addition formula. It goes like this: tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). Maybe I can use that here somehow. Let me see, if I take A as 20° and B as 40°, then A + B would be 60°, right? And I know that tan 60° is √3. That seems promising because the expression I need to evaluate has √3 in it.So, let me write down the tangent addition formula for 20° and 40°:tan(20° + 40°) = (tan 20° + tan 40°) / (1 - tan 20° tan 40°)Since 20° + 40° is 60°, this simplifies to:tan 60° = (tan 20° + tan 40°) / (1 - tan 20° tan 40°)And since tan 60° is √3, I can write:√3 = (tan 20° + tan 40°) / (1 - tan 20° tan 40°)Okay, so now I have an equation involving tan 20° and tan 40°. Let me denote tan 20° as T and tan 40° as S to make it easier to write. So, substituting:√3 = (T + S) / (1 - TS)I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:√3 (1 - TS) = T + SExpanding the left side:√3 - √3 TS = T + SHmm, let's rearrange this equation to group like terms. I'll bring all terms to one side:√3 - √3 TS - T - S = 0Wait, but I'm supposed to find the value of T + S + √3 TS. Let me look back at the original expression: tan 20° + tan 40° + √3 tan 20° tan 40°, which is T + S + √3 TS. So, if I can express this in terms of the equation I have, maybe I can find its value.From the equation above:√3 - √3 TS - T - S = 0Let me rearrange it:√3 = T + S + √3 TSWait, that's exactly the expression I need to evaluate! So, T + S + √3 TS equals √3. Therefore, the value of tan 20° + tan 40° + √3 tan 20° tan 40° is √3.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the tangent addition formula, I substituted 20° and 40°, which gives 60°, and since tan 60° is √3, that part is correct. Then, I set up the equation √3 = (T + S)/(1 - TS) and cross-multiplied to get √3 (1 - TS) = T + S. Expanding that gives √3 - √3 TS = T + S, which I rearranged to √3 = T + S + √3 TS. That seems correct.Another way to think about it is to consider that the expression T + S + √3 TS is equal to √3, so the value is indeed √3. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I think the answer is √3.**Final Answer**boxed{sqrt{3}}"},{"question":"A waiter had 22 customers in his section.

The waiter originally had 22 customers, and 8 remained. Therefore, 22 minus 8 equals 14 customers who left the section.Thus, the number of customers who left the waiter's section is 14."},{"question":"Let h_{n} denote the number of different ways to distribute n distinct items to 3 children such that each child receives at least one item. Find the counting formula for h_{n}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to distribute n distinct items to 3 children, and each child has to get at least one item. Hmm, let's see. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle from my combinatorics class. Maybe that can help here.First, if there were no restrictions, each item could go to any of the 3 children. Since the items are distinct, for each item, there are 3 choices. So, the total number of ways without any restrictions would be 3^n. That makes sense because for each of the n items, there are 3 options.But wait, the problem says each child has to get at least one item. So, I can't just use 3^n because that includes distributions where one or more children might not get any items. I need to subtract those cases where at least one child gets nothing.This is where the inclusion-exclusion principle comes into play. Let me recall how that works. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps in counting the number of elements in a union of multiple sets by including and excluding the intersections appropriately.So, let's define:- Let S be the set of all possible distributions without any restrictions. As we said, |S| = 3^n.- Let A1 be the set of distributions where the first child gets nothing. Similarly, A2 where the second child gets nothing, and A3 where the third child gets nothing.We need to find the number of distributions where none of the children get nothing, which is |S - (A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3)|.According to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of elements in the union of A1, A2, and A3 is:|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3| = |A1| + |A2| + |A3| - |A1 ∩ A2| - |A1 ∩ A3| - |A2 ∩ A3| + |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3|So, to find the number of valid distributions, we subtract this from the total number of distributions:|S - (A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3)| = |S| - |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3|Let me compute each term step by step.First, |A1|: This is the number of distributions where the first child gets nothing. So, each item can only go to the second or third child. That's 2 choices per item, so |A1| = 2^n. Similarly, |A2| = 2^n and |A3| = 2^n.Next, |A1 ∩ A2|: This is the number of distributions where both the first and second children get nothing. So, all items must go to the third child. There's only one way this can happen for each item, so |A1 ∩ A2| = 1^n = 1. Similarly, |A1 ∩ A3| = 1 and |A2 ∩ A3| = 1.Lastly, |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3|: This is the number of distributions where all three children get nothing. But that's impossible because we have n items to distribute. So, this is 0.Putting it all together:|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3| = 3*2^n - 3*1 + 0 = 3*2^n - 3Therefore, the number of valid distributions is:|S| - |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3| = 3^n - (3*2^n - 3) = 3^n - 3*2^n + 3Wait, let me double-check that. So, 3^n minus 3*2^n plus 3. Yeah, that seems right.Just to make sure, let's test this formula with a small n, say n=1. If n=1, we have only one item. The number of ways to distribute it so that each child gets at least one item should be 0 because we can't give one item to three children. Plugging into the formula: 3^1 - 3*2^1 + 3 = 3 - 6 + 3 = 0. That checks out.How about n=2? For two items, the number of ways where each child gets at least one item should be... Let's see. Each child must get at least one item, but we have only two items. So, one child gets both items, and the other two get none. But wait, that's not allowed because each child must get at least one. So, actually, it's impossible. So, the number should be 0. Plugging into the formula: 3^2 - 3*2^2 + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0. Correct again.Wait, n=3. For three items, each child gets exactly one item. The number of ways is 3! = 6. Let's see what the formula gives: 3^3 - 3*2^3 + 3 = 27 - 24 + 3 = 6. Perfect.Another test: n=4. The number of ways should be... Let's think. It's the number of onto functions from 4 elements to 3 elements, which is calculated by inclusion-exclusion as well. The formula is 3^4 - 3*2^4 + 3*1^4 = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36. Alternatively, using the formula for surjective functions, it's 3! * S(4,3), where S is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. S(4,3) is 6, so 6*6=36. So, our formula gives 3^4 - 3*2^4 + 3 = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36. Correct.Okay, so the formula seems to hold for these test cases. Therefore, I'm confident that the counting formula for h_n is 3^n - 3*2^n + 3."},{"question":"a 140 meter long train crosses a man standing on the platform in 6 sec . what is the speed of the train ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the speed of the train using the information provided.The train is 140 meters long and it takes 6 seconds to pass a man standing on the platform.Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.So, the distance the train travels while passing the man is equal to its own length, which is 140 meters.The time taken to pass the man is 6 seconds.Therefore, the speed of the train is 140 meters divided by 6 seconds, which equals approximately 23.33 meters per second."},{"question":"Sasha has 3.80 in U.S. coins. She has the same number of quarters as nickels, and twice as many dimes as quarters. What is the greatest number of quarters she could have?","answer":"First, I'll define the number of quarters Sasha has as ( q ).Since Sasha has the same number of nickels as quarters, she also has ( q ) nickels.She has twice as many dimes as quarters, so she has ( 2q ) dimes.Next, I'll calculate the total value contributed by each type of coin:- The value from quarters is ( 0.25q ) dollars.- The value from nickels is ( 0.05q ) dollars.- The value from dimes is ( 0.10 times 2q = 0.20q ) dollars.Adding these values together gives the total amount of money Sasha has:[0.25q + 0.05q + 0.20q = 0.50q]Since Sasha has a total of 3.80, I'll set up the equation:[0.50q = 3.80]Solving for ( q ):[q = frac{3.80}{0.50} = 7.6]Since the number of quarters must be a whole number, the greatest possible number of quarters Sasha can have is 7.Finally, I'll verify that 7 quarters, 7 nickels, and 14 dimes add up to 3.80:[0.25 times 7 + 0.05 times 7 + 0.10 times 14 = 1.75 + 0.35 + 1.40 = 3.50]This confirms that 7 quarters is the correct and maximum number under the given conditions."},{"question":"The energy stored by any pair of positive charges is inversely proportional to the distance between them and directly proportional to their charges. Three identical point charges begin at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, storing 15 Joules of energy in this configuration. Assume each side of the triangle is doubled. How much energy in Joules would be stored in this new configuration?","answer":"First, I recognize that the energy stored between two charges is inversely proportional to the distance between them and directly proportional to their charges. Since all three charges are identical, the energy between each pair depends solely on the distance between them.Initially, the charges form an equilateral triangle with side length ( d ). The total energy stored in this configuration is 15 Joules, which is the sum of the energy between each of the three pairs of charges.When the side length of the triangle is doubled to ( 2d ), the distance between each pair of charges increases. Since energy is inversely proportional to distance, doubling the distance will halve the energy between each pair.To find the new total energy, I calculate the energy for one pair at the new distance and then multiply by three to account for all pairs. This results in the total stored energy in the new configuration."},{"question":"If x in mathbb{R}, then the condition \\"x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0\\" is a ( ) condition for \\"x > 0\\".A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( x in mathbb{R} ), then the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) is a ( ) condition for ( x > 0 ). The options are A: Sufficient but not necessary, B: Necessary but not sufficient, C: Necessary and sufficient, D: Neither sufficient nor necessary.Hmm, I need to figure out whether the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for ( x > 0 ). Let me start by understanding what each term means.A sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement ( x > 0 ) must be true. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the statement can't be true without the condition. On the other hand, a necessary condition means that for the statement ( x > 0 ) to be true, the condition must be met. But it doesn't guarantee that the statement is true just because the condition is met.So, first, let me analyze the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ). I notice that this is a quadratic expression. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots to understand for which values of ( x ) this inequality holds.Let me try factoring ( x^2 - 2x + 1 ). Hmm, that looks familiar. It seems like a perfect square because ( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 ). So, the inequality becomes ( (x - 1)^2 leq 0 ).Wait, a square of a real number is always non-negative, right? So, ( (x - 1)^2 ) is greater than or equal to zero for all real ( x ). The only time it equals zero is when ( x - 1 = 0 ), which is when ( x = 1 ). So, the inequality ( (x - 1)^2 leq 0 ) holds only when ( x = 1 ).Okay, so the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) simplifies to ( x = 1 ). That means the only solution is ( x = 1 ). Now, I need to see how this relates to the statement ( x > 0 ).So, if ( x = 1 ), then ( x > 0 ) is definitely true. Therefore, whenever the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) is satisfied, ( x > 0 ) is also satisfied. That makes the condition a sufficient condition for ( x > 0 ).But is it a necessary condition? That would mean that ( x > 0 ) can only be true if ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ). However, ( x > 0 ) is true for many values of ( x ), like ( x = 2 ), ( x = 0.5 ), ( x = 100 ), etc., none of which satisfy ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) except for ( x = 1 ). So, the condition is not necessary because ( x > 0 ) doesn't require ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) to be true.Therefore, the condition ( x^2 - 2x + 1 leq 0 ) is sufficient but not necessary for ( x > 0 ). So, the correct answer should be option A.Wait, let me double-check. If ( x = 1 ), then ( x > 0 ) is true. So, the condition being true guarantees that ( x > 0 ) is true, which makes it sufficient. But since ( x > 0 ) can be true without the condition being true (for example, ( x = 2 )), the condition isn't necessary. Yeah, that makes sense.I think I'm confident now. The answer is A."},{"question":"Three machines perform certain work. If the first machine works alone, it will finish the work a days later than if all machines worked together. If the second machine works alone, it will finish b days later than if all worked together. If the third machine works alone, it will take c times longer than if all worked together. How many days does each machine work individually? What values can c take?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about three machines working together and individually. Let me try to understand what it's asking.First, it says that if the first machine works alone, it will finish the work 'a' days later than if all machines worked together. Similarly, the second machine alone takes 'b' days longer than all together. The third machine alone takes 'c' times longer than all together. I need to find how many days each machine takes individually and what values 'c' can take.Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to model this. I remember that work problems often involve rates. So, maybe I should define the work rates of each machine.Let's denote the total work as 1 unit. Then, the work rates of the machines can be expressed as fractions of the work done per day.Let’s say:- Machine 1 takes x days to complete the work alone, so its rate is 1/x.- Machine 2 takes y days, so its rate is 1/y.- Machine 3 takes z days, so its rate is 1/z.When all three machines work together, their combined rate is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z. The time taken when all work together would be 1 divided by this sum.Let me denote the time taken when all work together as T. So, T = 1 / (1/x + 1/y + 1/z).Now, according to the problem:- Machine 1 alone takes T + a days. So, x = T + a.- Machine 2 alone takes T + b days. So, y = T + b.- Machine 3 alone takes c*T days. So, z = c*T.So, I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of T and a, b, c.But I need to find x, y, z individually, so I need to express them without T. Maybe I can substitute these expressions into the equation for T.Let me write T again:T = 1 / (1/x + 1/y + 1/z)But x = T + a, y = T + b, z = c*T.So, substituting these into the equation:T = 1 / [1/(T + a) + 1/(T + b) + 1/(c*T)]Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for T.Let me write it step by step.First, the denominator is:1/(T + a) + 1/(T + b) + 1/(c*T)Let me combine these fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. The common denominator would be (T + a)(T + b)(c*T).So, let's compute each term:1/(T + a) = (T + b)(c*T) / [(T + a)(T + b)(c*T)]1/(T + b) = (T + a)(c*T) / [(T + a)(T + b)(c*T)]1/(c*T) = (T + a)(T + b) / [(T + a)(T + b)(c*T)]So, adding them together:[ (T + b)(c*T) + (T + a)(c*T) + (T + a)(T + b) ] / [(T + a)(T + b)(c*T)]Simplify the numerator:First term: (T + b)(c*T) = c*T^2 + b*c*TSecond term: (T + a)(c*T) = c*T^2 + a*c*TThird term: (T + a)(T + b) = T^2 + (a + b)*T + a*bSo, adding all three:c*T^2 + b*c*T + c*T^2 + a*c*T + T^2 + (a + b)*T + a*bCombine like terms:c*T^2 + c*T^2 + T^2 = (2c + 1)*T^2b*c*T + a*c*T + (a + b)*T = (b*c + a*c + a + b)*TAnd the constant term: a*bSo, numerator becomes:(2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*bDenominator is:(T + a)(T + b)(c*T) = c*T*(T + a)(T + b)So, putting it back into the equation for T:T = 1 / [ (2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*b ) / (c*T*(T + a)(T + b)) ]Which simplifies to:T = c*T*(T + a)(T + b) / [ (2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*b ]Multiply both sides by the denominator:T * [ (2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*b ] = c*T*(T + a)(T + b)Assuming T ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by T:(2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*b = c*(T + a)(T + b)Expand the right side:c*(T + a)(T + b) = c*(T^2 + (a + b)*T + a*b) = c*T^2 + c*(a + b)*T + c*a*bNow, bring all terms to the left side:(2c + 1)*T^2 + (b*c + a*c + a + b)*T + a*b - c*T^2 - c*(a + b)*T - c*a*b = 0Simplify term by term:For T^2: (2c + 1 - c)*T^2 = (c + 1)*T^2For T: (b*c + a*c + a + b - c*(a + b))*TLet me compute that:b*c + a*c + a + b - c*a - c*b = (b*c - c*b) + (a*c - c*a) + a + b = 0 + 0 + a + b = a + bConstant term: a*b - c*a*b = a*b*(1 - c)So, the equation becomes:(c + 1)*T^2 + (a + b)*T + a*b*(1 - c) = 0So, we have a quadratic equation in T:(c + 1)*T^2 + (a + b)*T + a*b*(1 - c) = 0Let me write it as:(c + 1)T² + (a + b)T + ab(1 - c) = 0Now, to solve for T, we can use the quadratic formula:T = [ -B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC) ] / (2A)Where A = c + 1, B = a + b, C = ab(1 - c)So,T = [ -(a + b) ± sqrt( (a + b)^2 - 4*(c + 1)*ab*(1 - c) ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]Simplify the discriminant:D = (a + b)^2 - 4*(c + 1)*ab*(1 - c)Let me compute this:D = a² + 2ab + b² - 4ab*(c + 1)*(1 - c)First, compute (c + 1)*(1 - c) = 1 - c²So,D = a² + 2ab + b² - 4ab*(1 - c²)= a² + 2ab + b² - 4ab + 4ab*c²= a² - 2ab + b² + 4ab*c²= (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c²So, discriminant D = (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c²Therefore, T is:T = [ -(a + b) ± sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]Since time cannot be negative, we take the positive root:T = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]So, now we have T in terms of a, b, c.But we need to find x, y, z.Recall:x = T + ay = T + bz = c*TSo, substituting T:x = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)] + aSimilarly,y = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)] + bz = c * [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]Let me simplify x:x = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)] + a= [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) + 2a*(c + 1) ] / [2*(c + 1)]= [ (-a - b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) + 2a*c + 2a ] / [2*(c + 1)]Combine like terms:(-a - b + 2a + 2a*c) = (a - b + 2a*c)So,x = [ (a - b + 2a*c) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]Similarly for y:y = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)] + b= [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) + 2b*(c + 1) ] / [2*(c + 1)]= [ (-a - b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) + 2b*c + 2b ] / [2*(c + 1)]Combine like terms:(-a - b + 2b + 2b*c) = (-a + b + 2b*c)So,y = [ (-a + b + 2b*c) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]And z is:z = c * [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]= [ -c*(a + b) + c*sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]So, now we have expressions for x, y, z in terms of a, b, c.But the problem also asks what values c can take.Looking back at the discriminant D = (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c², which is always positive since it's a sum of squares, so the square root is always real. But we also need T to be positive because time cannot be negative.Looking at T:T = [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]The numerator must be positive:- (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) > 0So,sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) > a + bSquaring both sides:(a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² > (a + b)^2Expand both sides:Left: a² - 2ab + b² + 4ab*c²Right: a² + 2ab + b²Subtract right from left:(a² - 2ab + b² + 4ab*c²) - (a² + 2ab + b²) = -4ab + 4ab*c² > 0Factor:4ab*(-1 + c²) > 0Since a and b are positive (they are days), 4ab > 0. So,-1 + c² > 0 => c² > 1 => c > 1 or c < -1But c is a multiplier of time, so it must be positive. Therefore, c > 1.So, c must be greater than 1.Therefore, the values c can take are c > 1.So, summarizing:Each machine takes:x = [ (a - b + 2a*c) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]y = [ (-a + b + 2b*c) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]z = [ -c*(a + b) + c*sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab*c² ) ] / [2*(c + 1)]And c must be greater than 1.I think that's the solution. Let me just check if the expressions make sense.For example, if c approaches 1 from above, what happens?As c approaches 1, z approaches [ - (a + b) + sqrt( (a - b)^2 + 4ab ) ] / 4Which is similar to the case when all machines have similar efficiency.And as c increases, z increases as well, which makes sense because z is c times T.Also, when c is very large, z becomes approximately c*T, and T becomes dominated by the term sqrt(4ab*c²)/[2*(c + 1)] ≈ (2c*sqrt(ab))/[2c] = sqrt(ab). So, z ≈ c*sqrt(ab)/(c + 1) ≈ sqrt(ab) as c increases, which seems reasonable.So, overall, the solution seems consistent."},{"question":"Find the general solution of the equation ( y^{prime prime prime} = frac{ln x}{x^{2}} ) and determine the solution that satisfies the initial conditions ( y(1) = 0 ), ( y^{prime}(1) = 1 ), ( y^{prime prime}(1) = 2 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this differential equation: ( y''' = frac{ln x}{x^2} ).

Let's set up the integral:[ y'' = int frac{ln x}{x^2} , dx ]Hmm, integrating ( frac{ln x}{x^2} ) isn't straightforward. Maybe I can use integration by parts. Let me recall the formula for integration by parts:[ int u , dv = uv - int v , du ]Let me choose ( u = ln x ) and ( dv = frac{1}{x^2} dx ). Then, I need to find ( du ) and ( v ).Calculating ( du ):[ du = frac{1}{x} dx ]Calculating ( v ):[ v = int frac{1}{x^2} dx = int x^{-2} dx = -x^{-1} = -frac{1}{x} ]Now, applying integration by parts:[ int frac{ln x}{x^2} dx = uv - int v , du = ln x cdot left(-frac{1}{x}right) - int left(-frac{1}{x}right) cdot frac{1}{x} dx ][ = -frac{ln x}{x} + int frac{1}{x^2} dx ][ = -frac{ln x}{x} - frac{1}{x} + C_1 ]So, the first integration gives me:[ y'' = -frac{ln x}{x} - frac{1}{x} + C_1 ]Alright, moving on to the second integration to find ( y' ):[ y' = int left( -frac{ln x}{x} - frac{1}{x} + C_1 right) dx ]Let me break this integral into three parts:1.

Given (alpha): (x in A cap B), (beta): (x) satisfies (2x+p leqslant 0). If (alpha) is a sufficient condition for (beta), find the range of the real number (p).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about domains of functions and conditions. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, the problem mentions two functions: f(x) = lg(x² - x - 2) and g(x) = sqrt(3/x - 1). It defines set A as the domain of f(x) and set B as the domain of g(x). Then, it introduces two conditions: α is when x is in the intersection of A and B, and β is when x satisfies the inequality 2x + p ≤ 0. The key part is that α is a sufficient condition for β, which means that if α is true, then β must also be true. I need to find the range of the real number p.Alright, let's break it down. I'll start by finding the domains A and B.For function f(x) = lg(x² - x - 2), since it's a logarithmic function, the argument inside the log must be greater than zero. So, x² - x - 2 > 0. Let me solve this inequality.x² - x - 2 > 0First, factor the quadratic equation x² - x - 2 = 0. Let's see, the factors of -2 that add up to -1 are -2 and +1. So, (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = 2 and x = -1.Since it's a quadratic opening upwards (coefficient of x² is positive), the expression x² - x - 2 will be greater than zero when x < -1 or x > 2. So, the domain A is (-∞, -1) ∪ (2, ∞).Next, for function g(x) = sqrt(3/x - 1). Since it's a square root, the expression inside must be greater than or equal to zero. So, 3/x - 1 ≥ 0.Let me solve this inequality:3/x - 1 ≥ 0First, combine the terms:(3 - x)/x ≥ 0So, the inequality is (3 - x)/x ≥ 0. To find where this is true, I need to consider the critical points where the numerator or denominator is zero. The numerator is zero when x = 3, and the denominator is zero when x = 0.So, the critical points are x = 0 and x = 3. These divide the real line into intervals: (-∞, 0), (0, 3), and (3, ∞). I'll test each interval.1. For x < 0: Let's pick x = -1. Plugging into (3 - (-1))/(-1) = (4)/(-1) = -4, which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.2. For 0 < x < 3: Let's pick x = 1. (3 - 1)/1 = 2, which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.3. For x > 3: Let's pick x = 4. (3 - 4)/4 = (-1)/4 = -0.25, which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.Also, at x = 0, the expression is undefined because of division by zero. At x = 3, the expression is zero, which is allowed since the square root can be zero.Therefore, the solution to (3 - x)/x ≥ 0 is (0, 3]. So, the domain B is (0, 3].Now, set A is (-∞, -1) ∪ (2, ∞) and set B is (0, 3]. The intersection of A and B, which is A ∩ B, would be the overlap between these two sets.Looking at A: (-∞, -1) ∪ (2, ∞) and B: (0, 3]. The overlap occurs where both sets are true. So, (-∞, -1) doesn't overlap with (0, 3], but (2, ∞) does overlap with (0, 3] from 2 to 3. Therefore, A ∩ B is (2, 3].So, α is the condition x ∈ (2, 3]. Now, β is the condition that x satisfies 2x + p ≤ 0. Let's write that inequality:2x + p ≤ 0 ⇒ 2x ≤ -p ⇒ x ≤ -p/2So, β is the set of all x such that x ≤ -p/2.The problem states that α is a sufficient condition for β. In logical terms, this means that if α is true, then β must be true. In set terms, this means that the set defined by α is a subset of the set defined by β. So, (2, 3] must be a subset of (-∞, -p/2].Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. If α is a sufficient condition for β, then whenever x is in A ∩ B, it must satisfy β. So, every x in (2, 3] must satisfy x ≤ -p/2.But wait, x is in (2, 3], which is all numbers greater than 2 and up to 3. So, if every x in (2, 3] must satisfy x ≤ -p/2, that would mean that the maximum value in (2, 3], which is 3, must be less than or equal to -p/2.So, 3 ≤ -p/2 ⇒ multiplying both sides by 2, 6 ≤ -p ⇒ multiplying both sides by -1 (and reversing the inequality), -6 ≥ p ⇒ p ≤ -6.Therefore, p must be less than or equal to -6.Wait, but let me double-check. If p is less than or equal to -6, then -p/2 is greater than or equal to 3. So, the set β would be x ≤ something greater than or equal to 3. But our set α is (2, 3], so all x in (2, 3] must be less than or equal to -p/2.But if -p/2 is greater than or equal to 3, then x ≤ -p/2 would include all x up to that point, which would certainly include (2, 3]. So, yes, that makes sense.But wait, is it possible for p to be exactly -6? If p = -6, then -p/2 = 3. So, β becomes x ≤ 3. Since α is (2, 3], which is entirely contained within (2, 3] being less than or equal to 3, so yes, p = -6 is acceptable.Therefore, p must be less than or equal to -6. So, the range of p is (-∞, -6].But let me think again. The problem says α is a sufficient condition for β. So, if x is in A ∩ B, then x must satisfy β. So, for all x in (2, 3], 2x + p ≤ 0. So, 2x + p ≤ 0 for all x in (2, 3]. So, the maximum value of 2x in (2, 3] is 6 (when x = 3). So, 6 + p ≤ 0 ⇒ p ≤ -6.Yes, that's another way to see it. So, the maximum value of 2x in (2, 3] is 6, so 6 + p ≤ 0 ⇒ p ≤ -6.Therefore, the range of p is all real numbers less than or equal to -6. So, p ∈ (-∞, -6].Wait, but in the initial thought process, I thought of p < -6, but considering p = -6, it's still valid because when p = -6, 2x -6 ≤ 0 ⇒ 2x ≤ 6 ⇒ x ≤ 3, which is exactly the upper bound of α. So, p = -6 is acceptable.Therefore, the range is p ≤ -6, which is (-∞, -6].I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:1. Found domain A by solving x² - x - 2 > 0, which gave (-∞, -1) ∪ (2, ∞).2. Found domain B by solving 3/x - 1 ≥ 0, which gave (0, 3].3. Found A ∩ B, which is (2, 3].4. Noted that β is x ≤ -p/2.5. For α to be a sufficient condition for β, every x in (2, 3] must satisfy x ≤ -p/2.6. Therefore, the maximum x in (2, 3] is 3, so 3 ≤ -p/2 ⇒ p ≤ -6.Yes, that all checks out. So, p must be less than or equal to -6."},{"question":"an empty fuel tank with a capacity of 208 gallons was filled partially with fuel a and then to capacity with fuel b . fuel a contains 12 % ethanol by volume and fuel b contains 16 % ethanol by volume . if the full fuel tank contains 30 gallons of ethanol , how many gallons of fuel a were added ?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many gallons of Fuel A were added to the tank. Let's denote the volume of Fuel A as ( x ) gallons.Fuel A contains 12% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in Fuel A is ( 0.12x ) gallons.The remaining volume of the tank, which is filled with Fuel B, is ( 208 - x ) gallons. Fuel B contains 16% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in Fuel B is ( 0.16(208 - x) ) gallons.The total amount of ethanol in the full fuel tank is given as 30 gallons. Therefore, I can set up the following equation:[0.12x + 0.16(208 - x) = 30]Next, I'll expand and simplify the equation:[0.12x + 33.28 - 0.16x = 30]Combine like terms:[-0.04x + 33.28 = 30]Subtract 33.28 from both sides:[-0.04x = -3.28]Finally, solve for ( x ):[x = frac{-3.28}{-0.04} = 82]So, 82 gallons of Fuel A were added to the tank."},{"question":"In the complex plane, the point corresponding to the complex number z=frac{1}{2-i} is located in ( ).A: The first quadrant  B: The second quadrant  C: The third quadrant  D: The fourth quadrant","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: In the complex plane, the point corresponding to the complex number ( z = frac{1}{2 - i} ) is located in which quadrant? The options are A: The first quadrant, B: The second quadrant, C: The third quadrant, D: The fourth quadrant.Alright, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that complex numbers can be represented as points in the complex plane, where the x-axis is the real part and the y-axis is the imaginary part. So, to figure out which quadrant ( z ) is in, I need to find its real and imaginary parts and see their signs.But ( z ) is given as ( frac{1}{2 - i} ). Hmm, that's a fraction with a complex number in the denominator. I think I need to simplify this expression to get it into the standard form ( a + bi ), where ( a ) is the real part and ( b ) is the imaginary part.To simplify ( frac{1}{2 - i} ), I recall that I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of ( 2 - i ) is ( 2 + i ). So, multiplying both numerator and denominator by ( 2 + i ) should help eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator.Let me write that out:[z = frac{1}{2 - i} times frac{2 + i}{2 + i} = frac{2 + i}{(2 - i)(2 + i)}]Now, I need to compute the denominator. Using the formula ( (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2 ), where ( a = 2 ) and ( b = i ), the denominator becomes:[(2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5]So, the denominator simplifies to 5. Now, the numerator is ( 2 + i ). Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:[z = frac{2 + i}{5} = frac{2}{5} + frac{1}{5}i]Okay, so now ( z ) is expressed as ( frac{2}{5} + frac{1}{5}i ). This means the real part of ( z ) is ( frac{2}{5} ) and the imaginary part is ( frac{1}{5} ). Both of these are positive numbers.In the complex plane, the first quadrant is where both the real and imaginary parts are positive. The second quadrant has a negative real part and a positive imaginary part, the third quadrant has both negative, and the fourth quadrant has a positive real part and a negative imaginary part.Since both ( frac{2}{5} ) and ( frac{1}{5} ) are positive, the point corresponding to ( z ) lies in the first quadrant.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate, which is correct. The denominator calculation: ( (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5 ). That seems right. The numerator: ( 1 times (2 + i) = 2 + i ). Dividing by 5 gives ( frac{2}{5} + frac{1}{5}i ). Yep, that looks correct.So, both the real and imaginary parts are positive, which means it's in the first quadrant. Therefore, the answer should be A: The first quadrant.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward once you remember to multiply by the conjugate. I guess another way to think about it is plotting the point ( frac{2}{5} ) on the real axis and ( frac{1}{5} ) on the imaginary axis, which would definitely be in the first quadrant.Yeah, I'm pretty confident now. The answer is A."},{"question":"The negation of the proposition \\"exists x_0 in mathbb{R}, x_0^2 - x_0 - 1 > 0\\" is ( )A: forall x in mathbb{R}, x^2 - x - 1 leqslant 0B: forall x in mathbb{R}, x^2 - x - 1 > 0C: exists x_0 in mathbb{R}, x_0^2 - x_0 - 1 leqslant 0D: exists x_0 in mathbb{R}, x_0^2 - x_0 - 1 geqslant 0","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about negating a proposition. Let me read it again: \\"The negation of the proposition '∃x₀ ∈ ℝ, x₀² - x₀ - 1 > 0' is ( )\\". The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, I need to figure out what the negation of this statement is.Alright, first, let's understand what the original proposition is saying. It says, \\"There exists a real number x₀ such that x₀ squared minus x₀ minus 1 is greater than zero.\\" So, in simpler terms, it's claiming that there is at least one real number where if you plug it into the quadratic expression x² - x - 1, the result will be positive.Now, I need to find the negation of this statement. Remember, the negation of an existential quantifier (∃) is a universal quantifier (∀), and the negation of the inner statement flips the inequality. So, if the original statement is \\"There exists an x such that P(x)\\", the negation would be \\"For all x, not P(x)\\".Applying that here, the negation should be: \\"For all real numbers x, x² - x - 1 is not greater than zero.\\" Which translates to \\"For all real numbers x, x² - x - 1 is less than or equal to zero.\\"Looking at the options:A: ∀x ∈ ℝ, x² - x - 1 ≤ 0  B: ∀x ∈ ℝ, x² - x - 1 > 0  C: ∃x₀ ∈ ℝ, x₀² - x₀ - 1 ≤ 0  D: ∃x₀ ∈ ℝ, x₀² - x₀ - 1 ≥ 0So, option A matches what I just thought. It changes the existential quantifier to a universal one and flips the inequality from > to ≤. That makes sense because if it's not true that there exists an x where the expression is greater than zero, then for every x, the expression must be less than or equal to zero.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original statement is about existence, so the negation should cover all possibilities, meaning it's a universal statement. The inequality also needs to be negated, so instead of being greater than zero, it should be less than or equal to zero. Yep, that's exactly what option A says.Just to be thorough, let's consider the other options:Option B: This is saying that for all x, the expression is greater than zero. That's actually stronger than the original statement. The original was just saying there exists some x where it's greater, but this is saying it's always greater. That's not the negation; it's a different statement altogether.Option C: This is another existential statement, but it's saying there exists an x where the expression is less than or equal to zero. That doesn't negate the original statement because the original was about existence, and this is also about existence. It's possible for both the original and this statement to be true if there are some x where the expression is greater and some where it's less than or equal.Option D: Similar to C, this is an existential statement about the expression being greater than or equal to zero. Again, this doesn't negate the original statement because it's still about existence, not about all x.So, after considering all options, A is definitely the correct negation. It properly changes the quantifier and negates the inequality.Just to make sure, maybe I can think about the quadratic expression x² - x - 1. Let's analyze its graph. It's a parabola opening upwards because the coefficient of x² is positive. The vertex of this parabola will be at x = -b/(2a) = 1/2. Plugging that back into the equation, the y-coordinate of the vertex is (1/2)² - (1/2) - 1 = 1/4 - 1/2 - 1 = -5/4. So, the vertex is at (0.5, -1.25). Since the parabola opens upwards, the expression x² - x - 1 will be less than zero between the two roots and greater than zero outside of them.Wait a second, so if the expression is less than zero between the roots and greater outside, then there are definitely real numbers where it's greater than zero. So, the original statement is actually true. But that doesn't affect the negation; the negation is still about what would make the original statement false.If the original statement is true, then its negation must be false. But regardless of the truth value, the process of negation is about flipping the quantifier and the inequality. So, even if the original is true, the negation is still correctly formed as option A.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, yeah, A is the right answer."},{"question":"Compute the sum of all positive integers ( n ) for which the expressionfrac{n+7}{sqrt{n-1}}is an integer.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that the expression ( frac{n + 7}{sqrt{n - 1}} ) is an integer. Then, I have to compute the sum of all such ( n ). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I notice that the denominator is ( sqrt{n - 1} ). For this to be an integer, ( n - 1 ) must be a perfect square because the square root of a non-perfect square is irrational, and we can't have an irrational number in the denominator if the whole expression is supposed to be an integer. So, let me set ( sqrt{n - 1} = k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. That means ( n - 1 = k^2 ), so ( n = k^2 + 1 ).Now, substituting ( n = k^2 + 1 ) back into the original expression, we get:[frac{n + 7}{sqrt{n - 1}} = frac{(k^2 + 1) + 7}{k} = frac{k^2 + 8}{k}]Simplifying that, it becomes:[frac{k^2 + 8}{k} = k + frac{8}{k}]Okay, so for this entire expression to be an integer, ( frac{8}{k} ) must also be an integer because ( k ) is already an integer. That means ( k ) must be a divisor of 8. Let me list the positive divisors of 8: 1, 2, 4, and 8.Now, for each of these ( k ) values, I can find the corresponding ( n ):1. If ( k = 1 ):   [   n = 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2   ]   2. If ( k = 2 ):   [   n = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5   ]   3. If ( k = 4 ):   [   n = 4^2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17   ]   4. If ( k = 8 ):   [   n = 8^2 + 1 = 64 + 1 = 65   ]So, the positive integers ( n ) that satisfy the condition are 2, 5, 17, and 65. Now, I need to find the sum of these integers:[2 + 5 + 17 + 65 = 89]Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. - For ( k = 1 ): ( n = 2 ). Plugging back into the original expression: ( frac{2 + 7}{sqrt{2 - 1}} = frac{9}{1} = 9 ), which is an integer. Good.  - For ( k = 2 ): ( n = 5 ). Plugging back: ( frac{5 + 7}{sqrt{5 - 1}} = frac{12}{2} = 6 ), which is an integer. Good.- For ( k = 4 ): ( n = 17 ). Plugging back: ( frac{17 + 7}{sqrt{17 - 1}} = frac{24}{4} = 6 ), which is an integer. Good.- For ( k = 8 ): ( n = 65 ). Plugging back: ( frac{65 + 7}{sqrt{65 - 1}} = frac{72}{8} = 9 ), which is an integer. Good.All these values check out. So, the sum is indeed 89.

Determine the smallest natural number ( n ) that satisfies the following property: In any set of ( n ) integers, there must be two numbers whose sum or difference is divisible by ( 2k + 1 ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given a natural number ( k ), I need to find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that in any set of ( n ) integers, there must be two numbers whose sum or difference is divisible by ( 2k + 1 ). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that when dealing with problems like this, modular arithmetic and the pigeonhole principle often come into play. The pigeonhole principle says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least two pigeons must share a hole. Maybe I can apply that here somehow.So, the problem is about sums or differences being divisible by ( 2k + 1 ). That means if I take two numbers from my set, either their sum or their difference should be a multiple of ( 2k + 1 ). Let's denote ( m = 2k + 1 ) to make things simpler. So, ( m ) is an odd number greater than or equal to 3 since ( k ) is a natural number.Now, I need to find the smallest ( n ) such that any set of ( n ) integers will have two numbers with their sum or difference divisible by ( m ). Let's think about how to approach this.Maybe I can consider the residues of these integers modulo ( m ). If two numbers have the same residue modulo ( m ), their difference is divisible by ( m ). That's straightforward. But the problem also mentions sums, so I need to consider that as well.Wait, if two numbers have residues ( a ) and ( b ) modulo ( m ), then their sum modulo ( m ) is ( a + b ). For this sum to be divisible by ( m ), ( a + b ) must be congruent to 0 modulo ( m ). That means ( b equiv -a ) modulo ( m ). So, if I have two numbers with residues ( a ) and ( -a ), their sum will be divisible by ( m ).Therefore, to ensure that either two numbers have the same residue (so their difference is divisible by ( m )) or two numbers have residues that are negatives of each other (so their sum is divisible by ( m )), I need to consider how many residues I can have without this happening.Let's think about the possible residues modulo ( m ). Since ( m = 2k + 1 ), the residues can be from ( 0 ) to ( 2k ). But considering negative residues as well, we can think of them as ( -k ) to ( k ) because ( m ) is odd. So, the residues can be paired as ( {1, -1}, {2, -2}, ldots, {k, -k} ), plus the residue ( 0 ).That gives us ( k ) pairs of residues and one single residue ( 0 ). So, in total, there are ( k + 1 ) distinct \\"types\\" of residues: each pair ( {j, -j} ) for ( j = 1 ) to ( k ), and the residue ( 0 ).Now, if I have a set of integers, each integer will fall into one of these residue classes. If I have more than ( k + 1 ) integers, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them must fall into the same residue class. But wait, if they fall into the same residue class, their difference is divisible by ( m ), which is what we want.But hold on, the problem also mentions sums. So, if two numbers fall into residue classes that are negatives of each other, their sum is divisible by ( m ). So, to avoid both having two numbers with the same residue or two numbers with residues that are negatives of each other, how many numbers can I have?Well, if I pick one number from each pair ( {j, -j} ) and also include the residue ( 0 ), I can have ( k + 1 ) numbers without any two having their sum or difference divisible by ( m ). For example, if I pick ( 1, 2, ldots, k, 0 ), none of these pairs will have a sum or difference divisible by ( m ).But if I add one more number, making it ( k + 2 ) numbers, then by the pigeonhole principle, I must have either two numbers in the same residue class or two numbers in complementary residue classes (i.e., ( j ) and ( -j )). Therefore, ( n = k + 2 ) is the smallest number that guarantees the condition.Let me test this with a small value of ( k ) to see if it makes sense. Let's take ( k = 1 ). Then ( m = 3 ). The smallest ( n ) should be ( 3 ). Let's see: if I have any three integers, there must be two whose sum or difference is divisible by 3.Consider the set ( {0, 1, 2} ). The differences are ( 1, 2, 1 ), none of which are divisible by 3. The sums are ( 1, 2, 3 ). Oh, wait, ( 0 + 3 = 3 ), but 3 is not in the set. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, actually, in the set ( {0, 1, 2} ), the sum of 1 and 2 is 3, which is divisible by 3. So, yes, in this case, it works. If I have three numbers, I must have two whose sum is divisible by 3.Another example: ( k = 2 ), so ( m = 5 ). Then ( n = 4 ). Let's see: any set of four integers must have two whose sum or difference is divisible by 5.Take the set ( {0, 1, 2, 3} ). The differences are ( 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1 ), none divisible by 5. The sums are ( 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 ). Ah, 2 + 3 = 5, which is divisible by 5. So, it works.If I try with ( n = 3 ), can I find a set where no two numbers have a sum or difference divisible by 5? Let's see: ( {1, 2, 3} ). Sums: 3, 4, 5. Oh, 2 + 3 = 5, which is divisible by 5. So, even with ( n = 3 ), it's not possible to avoid having a sum divisible by 5. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Hmm, maybe my reasoning was flawed. Let me think again.Wait, in the case of ( k = 2 ), ( m = 5 ), and ( n = 4 ). But in the set ( {1, 2, 3, 4} ), the sums are 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7. So, 1 + 4 = 5, which is divisible by 5. Similarly, 2 + 3 = 5. So, even with ( n = 4 ), it's unavoidable.But wait, what if I choose numbers that are all in the same residue class? For example, ( {1, 1, 1, 1} ). Then, their differences are 0, which is divisible by 5. So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, if I choose residues ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ), as above, I still get sums divisible by 5.Wait, maybe my initial assumption that ( n = k + 2 ) is correct, but in the case of ( k = 2 ), ( n = 4 ), which seems to hold. But when I tried ( n = 3 ), I still got a sum divisible by 5. So, perhaps ( n = k + 1 ) is sufficient? But that contradicts my earlier reasoning.Wait, no. Let's think about it again. If ( k = 1 ), ( m = 3 ), and ( n = 3 ). In that case, any three numbers must have two whose sum or difference is divisible by 3. But if I choose ( {1, 2, 4} ), their differences are 1, 2, 3, and sums are 3, 5, 6. So, 1 + 2 = 3, which is divisible by 3. So, yes, it works.But if I choose ( {1, 2, 3} ), then 1 + 2 = 3, which is divisible by 3. So, it seems that even with ( n = k + 1 ), it's unavoidable. But wait, earlier I thought that ( n = k + 2 ) is the answer. So, where is the mistake?Wait, maybe I need to consider that when ( n = k + 1 ), it's possible to have a set where no two numbers have a sum or difference divisible by ( m ). Let's see.For ( k = 1 ), ( m = 3 ), ( n = 2 ). Can I have two numbers whose sum or difference is not divisible by 3? Yes, for example, ( {1, 2} ). Their sum is 3, which is divisible by 3. So, no, even with ( n = 2 ), it's unavoidable.Wait, that's confusing. Maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me try to think differently.Perhaps I should consider the concept of \\"complementary\\" residues. For each residue ( a ), its complement is ( m - a ). So, if I have a number with residue ( a ), and another with residue ( m - a ), their sum is ( m ), which is divisible by ( m ).Therefore, to avoid having two numbers whose sum is divisible by ( m ), I can have at most one number from each complementary pair. Plus, I can have at most one number with residue 0.So, the number of complementary pairs is ( k ), since ( m = 2k + 1 ). Therefore, the maximum number of numbers I can have without having two numbers whose sum is divisible by ( m ) is ( k + 1 ) (one from each pair plus the zero residue).Similarly, to avoid having two numbers whose difference is divisible by ( m ), I need all numbers to have distinct residues. Since there are ( m ) residues, but we're considering modulo ( m ), the maximum number of numbers with distinct residues is ( m ). But since we're also considering sums, it's more restrictive.Wait, so to avoid both sums and differences being divisible by ( m ), I need to have all residues distinct and no two residues being complementary. That would mean selecting at most one residue from each complementary pair and at most one zero residue.Therefore, the maximum size of such a set is ( k + 1 ). Hence, if I have ( k + 2 ) numbers, I must have either two numbers with the same residue (difference divisible by ( m )) or two numbers with complementary residues (sum divisible by ( m )).Therefore, the smallest ( n ) is ( k + 2 ).Wait, but earlier when I tried ( k = 1 ), ( n = 3 ), and ( m = 3 ), it seemed that even with ( n = 2 ), it's unavoidable. But according to this reasoning, ( n = k + 2 = 3 ) is the answer. So, maybe my earlier confusion was because I was considering specific examples where it's unavoidable even with smaller ( n ), but in general, the worst case is ( k + 2 ).Let me try another example. Let ( k = 3 ), so ( m = 7 ). Then ( n = 5 ). Let's see if I can find a set of 4 numbers where no two have a sum or difference divisible by 7.Choose residues ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ). Now, check sums:1 + 2 = 3, not divisible by 71 + 3 = 4, not divisible by 71 + 4 = 5, not divisible by 72 + 3 = 5, not divisible by 72 + 4 = 6, not divisible by 73 + 4 = 7, which is divisible by 7. Oh, so even with 4 numbers, I have a sum divisible by 7. So, in this case, ( n = 5 ) is not necessary; ( n = 4 ) already forces a sum divisible by 7.Wait, that contradicts the earlier conclusion. So, maybe my reasoning is still flawed.Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose residues more carefully. Let's try to pick residues such that no two sum to 7 and no two are the same.Residues modulo 7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.Complementary pairs are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4).So, to avoid sums divisible by 7, I can pick at most one from each pair.Plus, I can pick at most one 0.So, maximum size without sums divisible by 7 is 4: one from each pair plus 0.But wait, if I pick 0, 1, 2, 3, then their sums are:0 + 1 = 10 + 2 = 20 + 3 = 31 + 2 = 31 + 3 = 42 + 3 = 5None of these are divisible by 7. So, in this case, with ( n = 4 ), I can have a set where no two numbers have a sum or difference divisible by 7.But wait, the differences:1 - 0 = 12 - 0 = 23 - 0 = 32 - 1 = 13 - 1 = 23 - 2 = 1None of these differences are divisible by 7 either.So, in this case, with ( n = 4 ), it's possible to have a set where no two numbers have a sum or difference divisible by 7. Therefore, ( n = 5 ) is indeed the smallest number where it's unavoidable.So, this aligns with the earlier conclusion that ( n = k + 2 ). For ( k = 3 ), ( n = 5 ).Therefore, the general answer is ( n = k + 2 ).I think I confused myself earlier by not considering that in some cases, even with ( n = k + 1 ), it might be unavoidable, but in the worst case, you can have a set of size ( k + 1 ) without the desired property, so ( n = k + 2 ) is indeed the smallest number that guarantees the condition.So, to summarize:- Consider residues modulo ( m = 2k + 1 ).- There are ( k ) complementary pairs and one zero residue.- To avoid sums divisible by ( m ), pick at most one from each pair and at most one zero.- This gives a maximum of ( k + 1 ) numbers.- Therefore, adding one more number (total ( k + 2 )) forces either a repeated residue (difference divisible by ( m )) or a complementary pair (sum divisible by ( m )).Hence, the smallest ( n ) is ( k + 2 )."},{"question":"No matter what real number m is, the line l: (m-1)x + (2m-1)y = m-5 always passes through a fixed point ______ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: No matter what real number ( m ) is, the line ( l: (m-1)x + (2m-1)y = m-5 ) always passes through a fixed point. I need to find that fixed point. Hmm, interesting. I remember that if a line passes through a fixed point regardless of the parameter, then that point must satisfy the equation for all values of the parameter. So, in this case, the point ( (x, y) ) should satisfy the equation ( (m-1)x + (2m-1)y = m-5 ) for all real numbers ( m ).Let me write down the equation again to make it clearer:[ (m - 1)x + (2m - 1)y = m - 5 ]I think I can rearrange this equation to group the terms involving ( m ) together. Let me try that. Expanding the left side:[ m x - x + 2m y - y = m - 5 ]Now, let's collect the terms with ( m ):[ m x + 2m y - x - y = m - 5 ]Factor out ( m ) from the terms that have it:[ m(x + 2y) - x - y = m - 5 ]Hmm, so now I have:[ m(x + 2y) - x - y = m - 5 ]Since this equation must hold true for all values of ( m ), the coefficients of ( m ) on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must also be equal. That gives me a system of two equations:1. Coefficient of ( m ): ( x + 2y = 1 )2. Constant term: ( -x - y = -5 )So, now I have a system of linear equations:1. ( x + 2y = 1 )2. ( -x - y = -5 )I need to solve this system to find the values of ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy both equations.Let me write the equations again:1. ( x + 2y = 1 )  -- Equation (1)2. ( -x - y = -5 ) -- Equation (2)I can solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. Let me try elimination. If I add Equation (1) and Equation (2) together, the ( x ) terms will cancel out.Adding Equation (1) and Equation (2):( (x - x) + (2y - y) = 1 - 5 )Simplify:( 0x + y = -4 )So, ( y = -4 )Now that I have ( y = -4 ), I can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find ( x ). Let's use Equation (1):( x + 2(-4) = 1 )Simplify:( x - 8 = 1 )Add 8 to both sides:( x = 1 + 8 )( x = 9 )So, the solution is ( x = 9 ) and ( y = -4 ). Therefore, the fixed point through which the line always passes is ( (9, -4) ).Wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I'll substitute ( x = 9 ) and ( y = -4 ) back into the original equation to see if it holds true for any ( m ).Original equation:[ (m - 1)x + (2m - 1)y = m - 5 ]Substitute ( x = 9 ) and ( y = -4 ):Left side:[ (m - 1)(9) + (2m - 1)(-4) ]Calculate each term:First term: ( 9(m - 1) = 9m - 9 )Second term: ( -4(2m - 1) = -8m + 4 )Combine the terms:( 9m - 9 - 8m + 4 = (9m - 8m) + (-9 + 4) = m - 5 )Right side:( m - 5 )So, left side equals right side: ( m - 5 = m - 5 ). That checks out.Therefore, my solution is correct. The fixed point is indeed ( (9, -4) ).I think I've got it. The key idea was to recognize that for the equation to hold for all ( m ), the coefficients of ( m ) and the constants must separately satisfy the equation, leading to a system of equations that can be solved for ( x ) and ( y ). Once I set up the system, solving it was straightforward using elimination. Then, verifying by substitution confirmed that the point satisfies the original equation for any ( m ).Another way I could approach this problem is by choosing specific values of ( m ) and finding the intersection point of the resulting lines. Since the fixed point lies on all such lines, it should be the intersection point of any two such lines. Let me try that method as a cross-check.Let's choose two different values for ( m ), say ( m = 0 ) and ( m = 1 ), and find the equations of the lines for these values. Then, find their intersection point.First, for ( m = 0 ):The equation becomes:[ (0 - 1)x + (0 - 1)y = 0 - 5 ][ -x - y = -5 ]Multiply both sides by -1:[ x + y = 5 ] -- Equation ANext, for ( m = 1 ):The equation becomes:[ (1 - 1)x + (2*1 - 1)y = 1 - 5 ][ 0x + (2 - 1)y = -4 ][ y = -4 ] -- Equation BNow, find the intersection of Equation A and Equation B.From Equation B, ( y = -4 ). Substitute into Equation A:( x + (-4) = 5 )( x - 4 = 5 )( x = 5 + 4 )( x = 9 )So, the intersection point is ( (9, -4) ), which matches the earlier result. This method also confirms that the fixed point is ( (9, -4) ).Alternatively, I could choose another value of ( m ), say ( m = 2 ), and see if the point ( (9, -4) ) lies on that line as well.For ( m = 2 ):The equation becomes:[ (2 - 1)x + (4 - 1)y = 2 - 5 ][ 1x + 3y = -3 ]Substitute ( x = 9 ) and ( y = -4 ):Left side: ( 9 + 3*(-4) = 9 - 12 = -3 )Right side: ( -3 )So, it holds true.Therefore, regardless of the method I use—whether by equating coefficients or by finding intersections of specific lines—the fixed point is consistently ( (9, -4) ). This gives me confidence that my solution is correct.In summary, the problem required identifying a point that lies on the given line for all real numbers ( m ). By manipulating the equation to separate the terms involving ( m ) and solving the resulting system of equations, I found the fixed point. Additionally, verifying with specific values of ( m ) further confirmed the solution. This approach is a standard method in analytic geometry for finding fixed points through which a family of lines passes.**Final Answer**The fixed point is boxed{(9, -4)}."},{"question":"Mickey's age is 20 years less than 400% of Jerry's age. If Mickey is 24 years old, how old is Jerry?","answer":"First, I need to understand the relationship between Mickey's age and Jerry's age as described in the problem.The problem states that Mickey's age is 20 years less than 400% of Jerry's age. This means that if I let ( J ) represent Jerry's age, then 400% of Jerry's age is ( 4J ).Next, according to the problem, Mickey's age ( M ) can be expressed as:[M = 4J - 20]I know that Mickey is 24 years old, so I can substitute ( M = 24 ) into the equation:[24 = 4J - 20]To solve for ( J ), I'll first add 20 to both sides of the equation:[24 + 20 = 4J][44 = 4J]Now, I'll divide both sides by 4 to find Jerry's age:[J = frac{44}{4} = 11]Therefore, Jerry is 11 years old."},{"question":"Let ( frac{p}{q} ) be an irreducible fraction, where ( p ) and ( q ) are natural numbers. Define ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right)=frac{p^{2} q^{2}}{q_{1} ldots q_{n}} ), where ( q_{1}, ldots, q_{n} ) are the distinct prime divisors of ( q ). Prove that ( f ) is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive rational numbers and the set of all natural numbers.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to prove that a certain function ( f ) is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive rational numbers and the set of all natural numbers. The function is defined as ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = frac{p^{2} q^{2}}{q_{1} ldots q_{n}} ), where ( frac{p}{q} ) is an irreducible fraction, and ( q_{1}, ldots, q_{n} ) are the distinct prime divisors of ( q ).Okay, let me start by understanding what this function does. So, given a positive rational number ( frac{p}{q} ) in its simplest form (meaning ( p ) and ( q ) have no common factors other than 1), the function ( f ) takes this fraction and maps it to a natural number. The mapping involves squaring both the numerator and the denominator, multiplying them together, and then dividing by the product of the distinct prime factors of the denominator ( q ).First, I need to make sure I understand the components here. An irreducible fraction ( frac{p}{q} ) means that ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, right? So, their greatest common divisor is 1. The distinct prime divisors of ( q ) are just the unique prime numbers that divide ( q ). For example, if ( q = 12 ), its prime divisors are 2 and 3.So, if I take ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) ), it's ( frac{p^2 q^2}{q_1 q_2 ldots q_n} ). Let me see what this simplifies to. Since ( q_1, q_2, ldots, q_n ) are the distinct primes dividing ( q ), their product is the radical of ( q ), often denoted as ( text{rad}(q) ). So, ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = frac{p^2 q^2}{text{rad}(q)} ).Hmm, interesting. So, this function is taking the square of the numerator and denominator, then dividing by the product of the distinct primes in the denominator. I need to show that this function is a bijection, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).Let me start by considering injectivity. To show that ( f ) is injective, I need to prove that if ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = fleft(frac{r}{s}right) ), then ( frac{p}{q} = frac{r}{s} ). So, suppose ( frac{p^2 q^2}{text{rad}(q)} = frac{r^2 s^2}{text{rad}(s)} ). I need to show that this implies ( frac{p}{q} = frac{r}{s} ).To do this, I should probably look at the prime factorizations of ( p ), ( q ), ( r ), and ( s ). Let's denote the prime factorizations as follows:- ( p = prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{a_i} )- ( q = prod_{j=1}^{n} q_j^{b_j} )- ( r = prod_{k=1}^{l} r_k^{c_k} )- ( s = prod_{m=1}^{o} s_m^{d_m} )Here, ( p_i, q_j, r_k, s_m ) are primes, and ( a_i, b_j, c_k, d_m ) are their respective exponents.Since ( frac{p}{q} ) and ( frac{r}{s} ) are in lowest terms, ( p ) and ( q ) share no common prime factors, and similarly for ( r ) and ( s ).Now, plugging these into the function ( f ):( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = frac{p^2 q^2}{text{rad}(q)} = frac{left(prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{a_i}right)^2 left(prod_{j=1}^{n} q_j^{b_j}right)^2}{prod_{j=1}^{n} q_j} = prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{2a_i} prod_{j=1}^{n} q_j^{2b_j - 1} )Similarly,( fleft(frac{r}{s}right) = prod_{k=1}^{l} r_k^{2c_k} prod_{m=1}^{o} s_m^{2d_m - 1} )Given that ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = fleft(frac{r}{s}right) ), their prime factorizations must be identical. Therefore, the primes in the factorizations must match, and their exponents must be equal.This implies that the set of primes in ( p ) and ( q ) must be the same as those in ( r ) and ( s ), and the exponents must satisfy:- For each prime ( p_i ) in ( p ), ( 2a_i = 2c_k ) for some ( k ), meaning ( a_i = c_k ).- For each prime ( q_j ) in ( q ), ( 2b_j - 1 = 2d_m - 1 ) for some ( m ), meaning ( b_j = d_m ).Since the primes are unique and the exponents match, this implies that ( p = r ) and ( q = s ). Therefore, ( frac{p}{q} = frac{r}{s} ), proving that ( f ) is injective.Now, onto surjectivity. I need to show that for every natural number ( N ), there exists a positive rational number ( frac{p}{q} ) such that ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = N ).Given any natural number ( N ), I can factorize it into its prime factors:( N = prod_{i=1}^{k} t_i^{e_i} )Each prime ( t_i ) in this factorization can be either from the numerator or the denominator of the original fraction ( frac{p}{q} ). Let me separate the primes into two groups: those with even exponents and those with odd exponents. Wait, actually, in the expression ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{2a_i} prod_{j=1}^{n} q_j^{2b_j - 1} ), the exponents for primes coming from ( p ) are even, and those from ( q ) are odd.So, for each prime in ( N ), if its exponent is even, it must come from ( p ), and if it's odd, it must come from ( q ). Therefore, to reconstruct ( frac{p}{q} ), I can set:- For each prime ( t_i ) with exponent ( e_i ) in ( N ):  - If ( e_i ) is even, let ( p ) include ( t_i^{e_i / 2} ).  - If ( e_i ) is odd, let ( q ) include ( t_i^{(e_i + 1)/2} ).This way, when I compute ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) ), the exponents for primes from ( p ) will be doubled (hence even), and for primes from ( q ), the exponents will be doubled and then reduced by 1 (hence odd), matching the exponents in ( N ).Therefore, every natural number ( N ) can be expressed as ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) ) for some positive rational number ( frac{p}{q} ), proving that ( f ) is surjective.Since ( f ) is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection between the set of positive rational numbers and the set of natural numbers.I think that covers both injectivity and surjectivity. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.For injectivity, I assumed that two different fractions could map to the same natural number and showed that this leads to the fractions being equal. For surjectivity, I showed that any natural number can be expressed in the form required by ( f ) by appropriately choosing ( p ) and ( q ). I also need to ensure that the function ( f ) is well-defined. Since ( frac{p}{q} ) is irreducible, ( p ) and ( q ) share no common primes, so their contributions to the prime factorization of ( fleft(frac{p}{q}right) ) are distinct. This ensures that the function doesn't inadvertently mix primes from ( p ) and ( q ), which could complicate the bijection.Additionally, the function ( f ) always results in a natural number because the denominator ( text{rad}(q) ) divides ( q^2 ). Since ( q ) is a natural number, ( q^2 ) is a multiple of ( text{rad}(q) ), making the division exact and resulting in a natural number.I think that's all the bases covered. I don't see any gaps in the logic, so I feel confident that this proof works."},{"question":"6 women can color a certain length of cloth in 3 days.

The ( alpha_k ) are ordered such that ( 0 < alpha_1 leq alpha_2 leq alpha_3 leq ldots leq alpha_{34} < 1 ).First, I need to understand what the polynomial ( P(x) ) looks like. The expression inside the square is a geometric series. I remember that the sum of a geometric series ( 1 + x + x^2 + ldots + x^n ) is ( frac{1 - x^{n+1}}{1 - x} ) when ( x neq 1 ). So, applying that here, the sum ( 1 + x + x^2 + ldots + x^{17} ) should be ( frac{1 - x^{18}}{1 - x} ).So, substituting that into ( P(x) ), we get:[P(x) = left( frac{1 - x^{18}}{1 - x} right)^2 - x^{17}]Hmm, okay. Maybe I can simplify this expression further. Let me write it out:[P(x) = frac{(1 - x^{18})^2}{(1 - x)^2} - x^{17}]To combine these terms, I might need a common denominator. Let's multiply the second term ( -x^{17} ) by ( frac{(1 - x)^2}{(1 - x)^2} ) so that both terms have the same denominator:[P(x) = frac{(1 - x^{18})^2 - x^{17}(1 - x)^2}{(1 - x)^2}]Now, let's expand the numerator:First, expand ( (1 - x^{18})^2 ):[(1 - x^{18})^2 = 1 - 2x^{18} + x^{36}]Next, expand ( x^{17}(1 - x)^2 ):[x^{17}(1 - x)^2 = x^{17}(1 - 2x + x^2) = x^{17} - 2x^{18} + x^{19}]Now, subtract the second expansion from the first:[(1 - 2x^{18} + x^{36}) - (x^{17} - 2x^{18} + x^{19}) = 1 - 2x^{18} + x^{36} - x^{17} + 2x^{18} - x^{19}]Simplify the terms:- The ( -2x^{18} ) and ( +2x^{18} ) cancel out.- So, we're left with ( 1 - x^{17} - x^{19} + x^{36} ).So, the numerator simplifies to:[1 - x^{17} - x^{19} + x^{36}]Therefore, the polynomial ( P(x) ) is:[P(x) = frac{1 - x^{17} - x^{19} + x^{36}}{(1 - x)^2}]Hmm, maybe I can factor the numerator further. Let me see:Looking at ( 1 - x^{17} - x^{19} + x^{36} ), perhaps factor by grouping.Group the first two terms and the last two terms:[(1 - x^{17}) + (-x^{19} + x^{36}) = (1 - x^{17}) - x^{19}(1 - x^{17})]Ah, so factor out ( (1 - x^{17}) ):[(1 - x^{17})(1 - x^{19})]So, the numerator becomes ( (1 - x^{17})(1 - x^{19}) ). Therefore, the polynomial ( P(x) ) is:[P(x) = frac{(1 - x^{17})(1 - x^{19})}{(1 - x)^2}]That's a nice simplification. So, the zeros of ( P(x) ) are the zeros of the numerator, excluding the zeros of the denominator. The denominator is ( (1 - x)^2 ), so ( x = 1 ) is a double root, but since it's excluded, the zeros of ( P(x) ) are the 17th roots of unity and the 19th roots of unity, excluding ( x = 1 ).So, the zeros are:- The 17th roots of unity: ( e^{2pi i k /17} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 16 )- The 19th roots of unity: ( e^{2pi i k /19} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 18 )Therefore, there are 16 + 18 = 34 zeros, which matches the degree of the polynomial.Each zero can be written in the form ( z_k = r_k [cos(2pi alpha_k) + i sin(2pi alpha_k)] ). Since all zeros are roots of unity, their modulus ( r_k ) is 1. So, each zero is simply ( e^{2pi i alpha_k} ), meaning ( alpha_k ) is the fractional part of the angle divided by ( 2pi ).So, the ( alpha_k ) for the 17th roots of unity are ( frac{k}{17} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 16 ), and for the 19th roots of unity, they are ( frac{k}{19} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 18 ).Now, I need to list all these ( alpha_k ) values, sort them in increasing order, and then add up the first five.So, let's list all the ( alpha ) values:From 17th roots:( frac{1}{17}, frac{2}{17}, frac{3}{17}, ldots, frac{16}{17} )From 19th roots:( frac{1}{19}, frac{2}{19}, frac{3}{19}, ldots, frac{18}{19} )So, we have 34 fractions. To find the five smallest ( alpha_k ), we need to compare the smallest fractions from both sets.Let me list the smallest fractions from both:From 17th roots: ( frac{1}{17} approx 0.0588 )From 19th roots: ( frac{1}{19} approx 0.0526 )So, ( frac{1}{19} ) is smaller.

Maybe I should list all the small fractions in order.Alternatively, perhaps I can list all the fractions and sort them.But since 17 and 19 are coprime, their fractions won't overlap except at 1.So, the order of the smallest fractions will be the smallest from both sets.Let me list the first few fractions:From 19th roots:( frac{1}{19} approx 0.0526 )( frac{2}{19} approx 0.1053 )( frac{3}{19} approx 0.1579 )( frac{4}{19} approx 0.2105 )( frac{5}{19} approx 0.2632 )( frac{6}{19} approx 0.3158 )( frac{7}{19} approx 0.3684 )( frac{8}{19} approx 0.4211 )( frac{9}{19} approx 0.4737 )( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 )( frac{11}{19} approx 0.5789 )( frac{12}{19} approx 0.6316 )( frac{13}{19} approx 0.6842 )( frac{14}{19} approx 0.7368 )( frac{15}{19} approx 0.7895 )( frac{16}{19} approx 0.8421 )( frac{17}{19} approx 0.8947 )( frac{18}{19} approx 0.9474 )From 17th roots:( frac{1}{17} approx 0.0588 )( frac{2}{17} approx 0.1176 )( frac{3}{17} approx 0.1765 )( frac{4}{17} approx 0.2353 )( frac{5}{17} approx 0.2941 )( frac{6}{17} approx 0.3529 )( frac{7}{17} approx 0.4118 )( frac{8}{17} approx 0.4706 )( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 )( frac{10}{17} approx 0.5882 )( frac{11}{17} approx 0.6471 )( frac{12}{17} approx 0.7059 )( frac{13}{17} approx 0.7647 )( frac{14}{17} approx 0.8235 )( frac{15}{17} approx 0.8824 )( frac{16}{17} approx 0.9412 )Now, let's merge these two lists in order:Start with the smallest:1.

( frac{4}{19} approx 0.2105 )8. ( frac{4}{17} approx 0.2353 )9. ( frac{5}{19} approx 0.2632 )10. ( frac{5}{17} approx 0.2941 )11. ( frac{6}{19} approx 0.3158 )12. ( frac{6}{17} approx 0.3529 )13. ( frac{7}{19} approx 0.3684 )14. ( frac{7}{17} approx 0.4118 )15. ( frac{8}{19} approx 0.4211 )16. ( frac{8}{17} approx 0.4706 )17. ( frac{9}{19} approx 0.4737 )18. ( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 )19. ( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 )Wait, hold on, ( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 ) is less than ( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 ). So, actually, the order should be:After 17. ( frac{8}{19} approx 0.4211 )18. ( frac{8}{17} approx 0.4706 )19. ( frac{9}{19} approx 0.4737 )20. ( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 )21. ( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 ) Wait, no, ( 0.5263 < 0.5294 ), so actually, after 19. ( frac{9}{19} approx 0.4737 ), next is ( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 ), then ( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 ).This is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should list all the fractions in order.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the first five smallest ( alpha_k ) are the first five smallest fractions from both sets.So, let's list the fractions in order:1. ( frac{1}{19} approx 0.0526 )2. ( frac{1}{17} approx 0.0588 )3. ( frac{2}{19} approx 0.1053 )4. ( frac{2}{17} approx 0.1176 )5. ( frac{3}{19} approx 0.1579 )6. ( frac{3}{17} approx 0.1765 )7. ( frac{4}{19} approx 0.2105 )8. ( frac{4}{17} approx 0.2353 )9. ( frac{5}{19} approx 0.2632 )10. ( frac{5}{17} approx 0.2941 )11. ( frac{6}{19} approx 0.3158 )12. ( frac{6}{17} approx 0.3529 )13. ( frac{7}{19} approx 0.3684 )14. ( frac{7}{17} approx 0.4118 )15. ( frac{8}{19} approx 0.4211 )16. ( frac{8}{17} approx 0.4706 )17. ( frac{9}{19} approx 0.4737 )18. ( frac{9}{17} approx 0.5294 )19. ( frac{10}{19} approx 0.5263 ) Wait, this is less than ( frac{9}{17} ), so actually, after 17, it should be ( frac{10}{19} ), then ( frac{9}{17} ), then ( frac{11}{19} approx 0.5789 ), and so on.But for the first five, it's clear that the order is:1. ( frac{1}{19} )2. ( frac{1}{17} )3. ( frac{2}{19} )4. ( frac{2}{17} )5. ( frac{3}{19} )So, the first five ( alpha_k ) are ( frac{1}{19}, frac{1}{17}, frac{2}{19}, frac{2}{17}, frac{3}{19} ).Now, I need to add these up:[alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 + alpha_5 = frac{1}{19} + frac{1}{17} + frac{2}{19} + frac{2}{17} + frac{3}{19}]Let's compute this step by step.First, combine the fractions with denominator 19:[frac{1}{19} + frac{2}{19} + frac{3}{19} = frac{1 + 2 + 3}{19} = frac{6}{19}]Next, combine the fractions with denominator 17:[frac{1}{17} + frac{2}{17} = frac{3}{17}]Now, add these two results together:[frac{6}{19} + frac{3}{17}]To add these, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 17 is 323 (since 19 and 17 are both prime).Convert each fraction:[frac{6}{19} = frac{6 times 17}{19 times 17} = frac{102}{323}][frac{3}{17} = frac{3 times 19}{17 times 19} = frac{57}{323}]Now, add them:[frac{102}{323} + frac{57}{323} = frac{159}{323}]So, the sum of the first five ( alpha_k ) is ( frac{159}{323} ).I should check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see if 159 and 323 have any common factors.159 factors: 3 × 53323 factors: 17 × 19No common factors, so ( frac{159}{323} ) is already in simplest form.Therefore, the answer is ( frac{159}{323} )."},{"question":"Given k in mathbb{N}^*, let the function f: mathbb{N}^* rightarrow mathbb{N}^* satisfy: for any positive integer n greater than k, f(n) = n - k.(1) Let k=1, then the value of the function f(x) at n=1 is boxed{a} (where a is a positive integer).(2) Let k=4, and when n leq 4, 2 leq f(n) leq 3, then the number of different functions f is boxed{16}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about functions defined on positive integers. Let me try to understand it step by step.First, the problem says that for a given positive integer ( k ), the function ( f: mathbb{N}^* rightarrow mathbb{N}^* ) satisfies that for any positive integer ( n ) greater than ( k ), ( f(n) = n - k ). So, for numbers bigger than ( k ), the function just subtracts ( k ) from them. That seems straightforward.Now, there are two parts to the problem.**Part (1):** Let ( k = 1 ). Then, the value of the function ( f(x) ) at ( n = 1 ) is ( boxed{a} ), where ( a ) is a positive integer.Hmm, okay. So when ( k = 1 ), the function ( f ) is defined such that for any ( n > 1 ), ( f(n) = n - 1 ). But what about when ( n = 1 )? The problem doesn't specify any condition for ( n leq k ), so ( n = 1 ) is the only case here. Since ( f ) maps positive integers to positive integers, ( f(1) ) must be some positive integer ( a ). The problem doesn't give any additional constraints, so ( a ) can be any positive integer. Therefore, the value at ( n = 1 ) is ( a ), which is just a placeholder for any positive integer.**Part (2):** Let ( k = 4 ), and when ( n leq 4 ), ( 2 leq f(n) leq 3 ). Then, the number of different functions ( f ) is ( boxed{16} ).Alright, so when ( k = 4 ), for ( n > 4 ), ( f(n) = n - 4 ). But for ( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ), the function ( f(n) ) can be either 2 or 3. So, each of these four values (for ( n = 1 ) to ( 4 )) has two choices: 2 or 3. To find the number of different functions, we can think of this as each of the four positions (1, 2, 3, 4) having two possible values. So, the total number of functions is ( 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 2^4 = 16 ). That makes sense because each choice is independent of the others.Wait, let me double-check. For each ( n ) from 1 to 4, there are 2 choices for ( f(n) ). Since these choices are independent, we multiply the number of choices for each ( n ). So, 2 choices for ( f(1) ), 2 for ( f(2) ), 2 for ( f(3) ), and 2 for ( f(4) ). That's ( 2^4 = 16 ) different functions. Yeah, that seems right.So, summarizing:1. For ( k = 1 ), ( f(1) ) can be any positive integer ( a ).2. For ( k = 4 ), with ( f(n) ) restricted to 2 or 3 for ( n leq 4 ), there are 16 different functions.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The first part is straightforward because there's no restriction except that ( f(1) ) must be a positive integer. The second part is a counting problem where each of the four function values has two choices, leading to 16 possibilities.**Final Answer**(1) (boxed{a})(2) (boxed{16})"},{"question":"A certain amount of water is added with 3 ltr of a solution containing 33% of alcohol in the water.

Since the solution is 33% alcohol, I can calculate the alcohol content by multiplying 3 liters by 0.33.Next, I'll let ( W ) represent the amount of water added. Adding ( W ) liters of water increases the total volume of the mixture to ( 3 + W ) liters.The percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is given as 24.75%. This means that the alcohol content in the new mixture can also be expressed as 24.75% of the total volume ( 3 + W ).Since the amount of alcohol remains the same before and after adding water, I can set up an equation equating the alcohol content before and after the addition of water.Finally, I'll solve this equation to find the value of ( W ), which represents the amount of water added."},{"question":"In an examination, a student scores 5 marks for every correct answer and loses 2 marks for every wrong answer.

Hmm, okay. I remember that sometimes when you have sine and cosine in an equation, you can use some identities or formulas to simplify it. Maybe I can rewrite sin x plus cos x in a different form that's easier to solve.Let me think. I recall that there's a formula for combining sine and cosine into a single sine or cosine function. It's something like A sin x plus B cos x equals C sin(x plus some angle). Yeah, I think that's right. So, maybe I can use that here.First, let's write down the equation again: sin x + cos x = -1. I need to find all x that satisfy this equation. Okay, so I want to express sin x + cos x as a single sine function. The general formula is A sin x + B cos x = C sin(x + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.In this case, A is 1 and B is also 1 because the coefficients of sin x and cos x are both 1. So, C should be the square root of (A squared plus B squared), which is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Okay, so C is sqrt(2). That makes sense.Now, the phase shift φ can be found using tan φ = B/A. Since A and B are both 1, tan φ = 1/1 = 1. So, φ is arctan(1), which is π/4 radians or 45 degrees. Got it. So, φ is π/4.Putting it all together, sin x + cos x can be written as sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4). So, the equation becomes sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4) = -1.Now, I can divide both sides by sqrt(2) to simplify it further. That gives me sin(x + π/4) = -1/sqrt(2). Hmm, okay. I know that sin(θ) = -1/sqrt(2) has solutions in specific quadrants.Let me recall the unit circle. The sine of an angle is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. The reference angle for which sin is 1/sqrt(2) is π/4, so the angles where sin is -1/sqrt(2) would be π + π/4 and 2π - π/4, which are 5π/4 and 7π/4.But since the sine function has a period of 2π, all solutions can be expressed as θ = 5π/4 + 2πn or θ = 7π/4 + 2πn, where n is any integer.But in our equation, θ is x + π/4. So, we can write:x + π/4 = 5π/4 + 2πn or x + π/4 = 7π/4 + 2πn.Now, I need to solve for x in both cases.First case:x + π/4 = 5π/4 + 2πnSubtract π/4 from both sides:x = 5π/4 - π/4 + 2πnSimplify:x = 4π/4 + 2πnWhich is:x = π + 2πnSecond case:x + π/4 = 7π/4 + 2πnSubtract π/4 from both sides:x = 7π/4 - π/4 + 2πnSimplify:x = 6π/4 + 2πnWhich simplifies to:x = 3π/2 + 2πnWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. 7π/4 minus π/4 is 6π/4, which is indeed 3π/2. Okay, that seems right.So, the solutions are x = π + 2πn and x = 3π/2 + 2πn, where n is any integer.But let me think if there's another way to express this. Sometimes, people prefer to write solutions in terms of multiples of π without fractions if possible. Let me see.Looking at x = π + 2πn, that's straightforward. For x = 3π/2 + 2πn, that's also fine. Alternatively, I could express 3π/2 as π + π/2, but I don't think that necessarily simplifies it more.Alternatively, I could factor out π from both solutions:x = π(1 + 2n) and x = (3/2)π + 2πn.But I think the way I have it is clear enough.Let me check if these solutions actually satisfy the original equation.First, take x = π. sin π is 0, cos π is -1. So, 0 + (-1) = -1, which matches the equation.Next, take x = 3π/2. sin(3π/2) is -1, cos(3π/2) is 0. So, -1 + 0 = -1, which also matches.Now, let's check another solution, say x = π + 2π = 3π. sin(3π) is 0, cos(3π) is -1. So, 0 + (-1) = -1. Good.And x = 3π/2 + 2π = 7π/2. sin(7π/2) is -1, cos(7π/2) is 0. So, again, -1 + 0 = -1. Perfect.So, it seems like my solutions are correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other solutions or if I missed something.When I solved for θ = x + π/4, I considered θ = 5π/4 + 2πn and θ = 7π/4 + 2πn. Are there any other angles where sin θ = -1/sqrt(2)? Let me think.No, in the interval [0, 2π), the only solutions are 5π/4 and 7π/4. Beyond that, it's just adding multiples of 2π. So, I think I covered all possible solutions.Therefore, the solution set is all real numbers x such that x = π + 2πn or x = 3π/2 + 2πn, where n is any integer.Alternatively, I can write it using a different notation, like x = (2n + 1)π or x = 2nπ - π/2, but let me see if that's equivalent.Wait, x = π + 2πn is the same as x = (2n + 1)π, which is like x = odd multiples of π.And x = 3π/2 + 2πn can be written as x = 2πn + 3π/2, which is the same as x = 2πn - π/2 if we adjust n accordingly.Because 3π/2 is equal to 2π - π/2, so adding 2πn gives x = 2πn - π/2.So, yes, that's another way to write it.Therefore, the solution set can also be expressed as x = (2n - 1)π or x = 2nπ - π/2, where n is any integer.I think both forms are acceptable, but perhaps the first form is more straightforward.In any case, the important thing is that the solutions are at x = π, 3π/2, 3π, 7π/2, and so on, repeating every 2π.So, summarizing, the solution set is all real numbers x such that x equals π plus any multiple of 2π, or x equals 3π/2 plus any multiple of 2π.I think that's a complete solution."},{"question":"The negation of the proposition \\"forall x gt 0, e^{x} gt x+1\\" is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this proposition: \\"For all x greater than 0, e raised to the power of x is greater than x plus 1.\\" I need to find the negation of this statement. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that negating a statement in logic involves flipping the quantifiers and the inequality. So, if the original statement is a universal quantifier (\\"for all\\"), the negation should be an existential quantifier (\\"there exists\\"). Similarly, if the original statement uses a greater than sign, the negation should use a less than or equal to sign.Wait, let me think about that again. The original statement is saying that for every x greater than 0, e^x is greater than x + 1. So, the negation would mean that there is at least one x greater than 0 where e^x is not greater than x + 1. That could mean e^x is equal to x + 1 or less than x + 1. But in this case, since e^x is always greater than x + 1 for x > 0, the negation would specifically mean that there exists an x > 0 where e^x is less than x + 1.Okay, so to negate the original statement, I need to switch the \\"for all\\" to \\"there exists\\" and change the inequality from \\">\\" to \\"<\\". That makes sense because the negation of \\"for all x, P(x)\\" is \\"there exists x such that not P(x)\\". So, applying that here, the negation would be \\"there exists an x > 0 such that e^x is less than x + 1\\".Wait, but is that accurate? Let me double-check. If the original statement is \\"for all x > 0, e^x > x + 1\\", then the negation would indeed be \\"there exists an x > 0 where e^x is not greater than x + 1\\". Since e^x is always greater than x + 1 for x > 0, the negation would specifically mean that there is some x > 0 where e^x is less than x + 1.But hold on, is there any x > 0 where e^x is actually less than x + 1? I thought e^x grows faster than any linear function, so maybe there isn't such an x. But logically, the negation doesn't have to be true; it just has to be the correct logical negation of the original statement.So, regardless of whether the negation is true or not, the logical negation of \\"for all x > 0, e^x > x + 1\\" is \\"there exists an x > 0 such that e^x < x + 1\\".Let me write that out to make sure it's clear: \\"There exists an x > 0 such that e^x < x + 1.\\"Yeah, that seems right.

Find the real root of this cubic polynomial.","answer":"Okay, so I have this cubic polynomial: ( ax^3 + 4x^2 + bx - 100 = 0 ). One of the roots is given as ( -3 - 4i ). Hmm, since the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, I remember that complex roots come in conjugate pairs. That means if ( -3 - 4i ) is a root, then its conjugate ( -3 + 4i ) must also be a root. So, that gives me two roots already: ( -3 - 4i ) and ( -3 + 4i ).Now, since it's a cubic polynomial, there must be three roots in total. The third root has to be real because the other two are complex conjugates. So, my goal is to find that real root. But before I can find the real root, I think I need to figure out the values of ( a ) and ( b ) first. Because without knowing ( a ) and ( b ), I can't write down the polynomial completely, and hence can't find the real root.Alright, let's start by plugging the complex root ( -3 - 4i ) into the polynomial equation. That should give me an equation involving ( a ) and ( b ). So, substituting ( x = -3 - 4i ) into ( ax^3 + 4x^2 + bx - 100 = 0 ), we get:( a(-3 - 4i)^3 + 4(-3 - 4i)^2 + b(-3 - 4i) - 100 = 0 ).Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I can handle it by expanding each term step by step.First, let me compute ( (-3 - 4i)^2 ). Using the formula ( (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ), but since it's ( (-3 - 4i)^2 ), it's actually ( (-3)^2 + 2(-3)(-4i) + (-4i)^2 ).Calculating each term:- ( (-3)^2 = 9 )- ( 2(-3)(-4i) = 24i )- ( (-4i)^2 = 16i^2 = 16(-1) = -16 )So, adding them up: ( 9 + 24i - 16 = (9 - 16) + 24i = -7 + 24i ).Okay, so ( (-3 - 4i)^2 = -7 + 24i ).Next, I need to compute ( (-3 - 4i)^3 ). That's ( (-3 - 4i) times (-3 - 4i)^2 ). Since I already have ( (-3 - 4i)^2 = -7 + 24i ), I can multiply that by ( (-3 - 4i) ).So, ( (-3 - 4i)(-7 + 24i) ). Let's compute this:Multiply each term:- ( (-3) times (-7) = 21 )- ( (-3) times 24i = -72i )- ( (-4i) times (-7) = 28i )- ( (-4i) times 24i = -96i^2 = -96(-1) = 96 )Now, adding all these together:( 21 - 72i + 28i + 96 = (21 + 96) + (-72i + 28i) = 117 - 44i ).Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.Wait, no, when I multiplied ( (-4i) times 24i ), that should be ( -96i^2 ), which is ( +96 ) because ( i^2 = -1 ). So, that part is correct.Then, combining the real parts: 21 + 96 = 117.Now, the imaginary parts: -72i + 28i = (-72 + 28)i = (-44)i.So, ( (-3 - 4i)^3 = 117 - 44i ). Wait, but in the initial solution, it was 117 - 112i. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me recompute ( (-3 - 4i)^3 ). Maybe I messed up the multiplication.Wait, no, actually, let's do it step by step:( (-3 - 4i)^3 = (-3 - 4i) times (-3 - 4i) times (-3 - 4i) ).We already have ( (-3 - 4i)^2 = -7 + 24i ). So, multiplying that by ( (-3 - 4i) ):( (-7 + 24i)(-3 - 4i) ).Let's compute this:First, multiply -7 by each term in the second bracket:-7 * (-3) = 21-7 * (-4i) = 28iThen, multiply 24i by each term in the second bracket:24i * (-3) = -72i24i * (-4i) = -96i^2 = +96So, adding all these together:21 + 28i - 72i + 96 = (21 + 96) + (28i - 72i) = 117 - 44i.Hmm, so that's 117 - 44i. Wait, but in the initial solution, it was 117 - 112i. Did I do something wrong?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the multiplication again.Wait, no, perhaps the initial solution had a different expansion. Let me see:Wait, in the initial solution, it was written as:[ (-3 - 4i)^3 = (-3 - 4i)(-7 + 24i) = 21 - 84i - 28i + 96 = 117 - 112i. ]Wait, that's different from what I just calculated. So, where is the discrepancy?Wait, in my calculation, I have:(-7 + 24i)(-3 - 4i) = 21 + 28i -72i -96i^2.Wait, but in the initial solution, it's written as:(-3 - 4i)(-7 + 24i) = 21 - 84i -28i +96.Wait, so in the initial solution, they have:First term: (-3)*(-7) = 21Second term: (-3)*(24i) = -72iThird term: (-4i)*(-7) = 28iFourth term: (-4i)*(24i) = -96i^2 = +96So, adding up: 21 -72i +28i +96 = 117 -44i.Wait, so that's the same as what I just did. But in the initial solution, it's written as 21 -84i -28i +96, which would be 117 -112i. That must be a mistake in the initial solution.Wait, so perhaps the initial solution had a miscalculation. So, the correct value should be 117 -44i.Wait, but in my calculation, I have 117 -44i, but in the initial solution, it's 117 -112i. So, which one is correct?Wait, let me do the multiplication again:(-3 -4i)(-7 +24i):First, multiply -3 by -7: 21Then, -3 by 24i: -72iThen, -4i by -7: 28iThen, -4i by 24i: -96i^2 = +96Now, adding all these together:21 -72i +28i +96 = (21 +96) + (-72i +28i) = 117 -44i.Yes, so that's correct. So, the initial solution had a mistake in the expansion, leading to an incorrect value of 117 -112i. The correct value is 117 -44i.Okay, so now, going back to the equation:( a(-3 -4i)^3 +4(-3 -4i)^2 +b(-3 -4i) -100 =0 ).Substituting the computed values:( a(117 -44i) +4(-7 +24i) +b(-3 -4i) -100 =0 ).Now, let's compute each term:First term: ( a(117 -44i) = 117a -44ai )Second term: 4*(-7 +24i) = -28 +96iThird term: b*(-3 -4i) = -3b -4biFourth term: -100.Now, adding all these together:(117a -44ai) + (-28 +96i) + (-3b -4bi) -100 =0.Now, let's combine like terms. Let's separate the real parts and the imaginary parts.Real parts:117a -28 -3b -100.Imaginary parts:-44a i +96i -4b i.So, combining real parts:117a -3b -128.Imaginary parts:(-44a +96 -4b)i.Since the polynomial equals zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, we have two equations:1. 117a -3b -128 =02. -44a +96 -4b =0.So, now we have a system of two equations with two variables, a and b.Let me write them clearly:Equation 1: 117a -3b = 128Equation 2: -44a -4b = -96Wait, hold on, in the imaginary part, it's (-44a +96 -4b)i =0, so:-44a -4b +96 =0.Wait, but in the initial solution, it was written as -112a +96 -4b=0, which was incorrect because of the mistake in the expansion. So, in reality, it's -44a -4b +96=0.So, now, we have:Equation 1: 117a -3b =128Equation 2: -44a -4b = -96.Let me write them again:117a -3b =128 ...(1)-44a -4b = -96 ...(2)Now, let's solve this system.First, let's simplify equation (2). Let's divide both sides by -4 to make the coefficients smaller.-44a -4b = -96Divide by -4:11a + b =24 ...(2a)So, equation (2a): 11a + b =24.Now, equation (1): 117a -3b =128.Let me solve equation (2a) for b:b =24 -11a.Now, substitute this into equation (1):117a -3*(24 -11a) =128.Compute:117a -72 +33a =128.Combine like terms:(117a +33a) -72 =128150a -72 =128Add 72 to both sides:150a =200Divide both sides by 150:a =200/150 =4/3 ≈1.333...Wait, that's a fractional value. Hmm, but in the initial solution, a was found to be 4. So, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.Wait, let me check my steps again.So, starting from the substitution:We had:117a -3b =128 ...(1)11a + b =24 ...(2a)From (2a): b=24 -11a.Substitute into (1):117a -3*(24 -11a) =128.Compute:117a -72 +33a =128.So, 117a +33a =150a.150a -72 =128.150a =128 +72=200.So, a=200/150=4/3.Hmm, that's correct. So, a=4/3.Then, b=24 -11a=24 -11*(4/3)=24 -44/3= (72/3 -44/3)=28/3≈9.333...Wait, but in the initial solution, a was 4 and b was 8. So, that suggests that perhaps the initial solution had a mistake in the expansion of (-3 -4i)^3.Wait, in the initial solution, they had (-3 -4i)^3=117 -112i, but in reality, it's 117 -44i, as we computed. So, that mistake led to incorrect equations, which in turn led to a=4 and b=8.But in reality, with the correct expansion, we have a=4/3 and b=28/3.Wait, but let me check if that makes sense.Wait, let me plug a=4/3 and b=28/3 into the original polynomial and see if x=-3 -4i is a root.So, the polynomial becomes:(4/3)x^3 +4x^2 + (28/3)x -100=0.Let me compute this at x=-3 -4i.First, compute x^3:x=-3 -4i, so x^3=117 -44i as we computed earlier.So, (4/3)*(117 -44i)= (4/3)*117 - (4/3)*44i= 156 - (176/3)i.Next, 4x^2=4*(-7 +24i)= -28 +96i.Then, (28/3)x= (28/3)*(-3 -4i)= -28 - (112/3)i.Finally, -100.Now, add all these together:156 - (176/3)i -28 +96i -28 - (112/3)i -100.Let's compute real parts and imaginary parts separately.Real parts:156 -28 -28 -100=156 -156=0.Imaginary parts:- (176/3)i +96i - (112/3)i.Convert 96i to thirds: 96i=288/3 i.So, total imaginary parts:(-176/3 +288/3 -112/3)i= (0/3)i=0.So, indeed, the total is 0, which confirms that x=-3 -4i is a root when a=4/3 and b=28/3.Wait, so the initial solution had a mistake in the expansion of (-3 -4i)^3, leading to incorrect values of a and b. So, the correct values are a=4/3 and b=28/3.Now, with these values, the polynomial becomes:(4/3)x^3 +4x^2 + (28/3)x -100=0.To make it easier, let's multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:4x^3 +12x^2 +28x -300=0.So, the polynomial is 4x^3 +12x^2 +28x -300=0.Now, since we know that x=-3 -4i and x=-3 +4i are roots, the third root must be real. Let's denote the roots as r1=-3 -4i, r2=-3 +4i, and r3= real root.We can use Vieta's formula to find the real root.Vieta's formula for cubic equation ax^3 +bx^2 +cx +d=0:Sum of roots: r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/a.Product of roots: r1*r2*r3 = -d/a.Sum of products two at a time: r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = c/a.So, in our case, the polynomial is 4x^3 +12x^2 +28x -300=0.So, a=4, b=12, c=28, d=-300.Sum of roots: r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/a = -12/4 = -3.We know r1 + r2 = (-3 -4i) + (-3 +4i) = -6.So, -6 + r3 = -3.Therefore, r3= -3 +6=3.So, the real root is 3.Alternatively, we can factor the polynomial.Since we know two roots, we can factor the polynomial as (x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3).But since r1 and r2 are complex conjugates, their product is a quadratic with real coefficients.So, (x - (-3 -4i))(x - (-3 +4i))= (x +3 +4i)(x +3 -4i)= (x +3)^2 - (4i)^2= x^2 +6x +9 +16= x^2 +6x +25.So, the polynomial can be written as (x^2 +6x +25)(x - r3)=4x^3 +12x^2 +28x -300.Let's expand (x^2 +6x +25)(x - r3):= x^3 - r3x^2 +6x^2 -6r3x +25x -25r3.Combine like terms:= x^3 + ( -r3 +6 )x^2 + ( -6r3 +25 )x -25r3.Now, set this equal to the original polynomial divided by 4:(4x^3 +12x^2 +28x -300)/4= x^3 +3x^2 +7x -75.So, equate coefficients:x^3: 1=1, okay.x^2: (-r3 +6)=3.x: (-6r3 +25)=7.constant term: -25r3= -75.Let's solve for r3.From the constant term:-25r3= -75.Divide both sides by -25:r3=3.So, the real root is 3.Therefore, the real root is 3."},{"question":"Given xi sim N(mu, delta^2), if P(xi > 4) = P(xi < 2) holds, and P(xi leq 0) = 0.2, then P(0 < xi < 6) = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where ξ follows a normal distribution with mean μ and variance δ². The problem states two things: first, that the probability of ξ being greater than 4 is equal to the probability of ξ being less than 2, and second, that the probability of ξ being less than or equal to 0 is 0.2. I need to find the probability that ξ is between 0 and 6.Alright, let's break this down step by step. Since ξ is normally distributed, I know that the distribution is symmetric around its mean μ. The first condition given is that P(ξ > 4) = P(ξ < 2). This seems like it's telling me something about the symmetry of the distribution. If the probabilities of being above 4 and below 2 are equal, then the mean μ must be exactly halfway between 4 and 2. Let me calculate that.The midpoint between 4 and 2 is (4 + 2)/2 = 3. So, that suggests that the mean μ is 3. That makes sense because in a normal distribution, the mean is the center of symmetry, so if the probabilities on either side of two points are equal, those points must be equidistant from the mean. So, I can conclude that μ = 3.Now, moving on to the second condition: P(ξ ≤ 0) = 0.2. This is the probability that ξ is less than or equal to 0, which is given as 0.2. Since we know the mean μ is 3, we can use this information to find the standard deviation σ. To do this, I need to standardize the variable ξ.Standardizing ξ, we get Z = (ξ - μ)/σ. So, for ξ = 0, Z = (0 - 3)/σ = -3/σ. The probability P(ξ ≤ 0) is equal to P(Z ≤ -3/σ) = 0.2. I need to find the value of σ such that the standard normal variable Z has a probability of 0.2 to the left of -3/σ. To find this, I can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The value of Z such that P(Z ≤ z) = 0.2 is approximately -0.8416. This is because the 20th percentile of the standard normal distribution is around -0.8416.So, setting -3/σ equal to -0.8416, we can solve for σ:-3/σ = -0.8416  => 3/σ = 0.8416  => σ = 3 / 0.8416 ≈ 3.563So, the standard deviation σ is approximately 3.563. Now, with μ = 3 and σ ≈ 3.563, I can find the probability P(0 < ξ < 6). To do this, I'll convert the values 0 and 6 to their respective Z-scores.For ξ = 0:Z₁ = (0 - 3)/3.563 ≈ -0.8416For ξ = 6:Z₂ = (6 - 3)/3.563 ≈ 0.8416So, P(0 < ξ < 6) is equivalent to P(-0.8416 < Z < 0.8416). Looking at the standard normal distribution table, the probability that Z is less than 0.8416 is approximately 0.7995. Similarly, the probability that Z is less than -0.8416 is approximately 0.2005. Therefore, the probability between -0.8416 and 0.8416 is:P(-0.8416 < Z < 0.8416) = P(Z < 0.8416) - P(Z < -0.8416) ≈ 0.7995 - 0.2005 = 0.599So, approximately 0.6 or 60%.Wait, let me verify that. If P(Z < 0.8416) is about 0.7995 and P(Z < -0.8416) is about 0.2005, then subtracting them gives 0.599, which is roughly 0.6. That seems correct.Alternatively, since the distribution is symmetric, the area from -0.8416 to 0.8416 is twice the area from 0 to 0.8416. The area from 0 to 0.8416 is approximately 0.2995, so doubling that gives 0.599, which is about 0.6. That matches.Therefore, P(0 < ξ < 6) ≈ 0.6.Wait, but let me think again. The initial problem didn't specify whether δ is the standard deviation or the variance. In the problem statement, it's written as N(μ, δ²), so δ² is the variance, which means δ is the standard deviation. So, in my earlier calculation, I used σ, which is the standard deviation, so that's consistent. So, σ ≈ 3.563 is correct.Alternatively, if I had used δ as the standard deviation, it would have been the same. So, no issue there.Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with probabilities, it's easy to make a mistake.Given that P(ξ ≤ 0) = 0.2, which translates to P(Z ≤ (0 - 3)/σ) = 0.2. The Z value corresponding to 0.2 is indeed approximately -0.8416. So, (0 - 3)/σ = -0.8416, which gives σ = 3 / 0.8416 ≈ 3.563. That seems correct.Then, for ξ = 6, Z = (6 - 3)/3.563 ≈ 0.8416. So, P(ξ < 6) is P(Z < 0.8416) ≈ 0.7995, and P(ξ < 0) is 0.2. Therefore, P(0 < ξ < 6) = P(ξ < 6) - P(ξ < 0) ≈ 0.7995 - 0.2 = 0.5995, which is approximately 0.6.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, since the distribution is symmetric around μ = 3, the distance from 3 to 0 is 3 units, and the distance from 3 to 6 is also 3 units. So, the interval from 0 to 6 is symmetric around the mean. Therefore, the probability should be the same as the probability that Z is between -0.8416 and 0.8416, which is about 0.6.So, I think my answer is correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Since we know that P(ξ > 4) = P(ξ < 2), and we found μ = 3, we can also find σ by considering the distance from μ to 4 and 2.The distance from μ = 3 to 4 is 1, and from 3 to 2 is also 1. So, in terms of standard deviations, these points are 1 unit away from the mean. But in our earlier calculation, we found that σ ≈ 3.563, so 1 unit in terms of ξ is 1/3.563 ≈ 0.2805 standard deviations. That seems a bit small, but let's see.Wait, actually, the Z-scores for 4 and 2 would be:For ξ = 4: Z = (4 - 3)/σ ≈ 1/3.563 ≈ 0.2805For ξ = 2: Z = (2 - 3)/σ ≈ -1/3.563 ≈ -0.2805But we were given that P(ξ > 4) = P(ξ < 2). So, P(Z > 0.2805) = P(Z < -0.2805). Looking at standard normal tables, P(Z < -0.2805) is approximately 0.388, and P(Z > 0.2805) is also approximately 0.388. So, that checks out because 0.2805 is approximately the Z-score where the tail probability is about 0.388. Wait, but earlier, when we calculated σ, we used the fact that P(ξ ≤ 0) = 0.2, which gave us σ ≈ 3.563. So, the distance from μ = 3 to 0 is 3 units, which in terms of σ is 3/3.563 ≈ 0.8416 standard deviations, which matches the Z-score we found earlier.So, everything seems consistent.Therefore, putting it all together, P(0 < ξ < 6) is approximately 0.6.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 0.6."},{"question":"In an isosceles triangle, the center of the inscribed circle divides the altitude in the ratio 17: 15. The base is 60. Find the radius of this circle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle where the center of the inscribed circle divides the altitude in the ratio 17:15, and the base is 60. I need to find the radius of the inscribed circle. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me visualize the triangle. It's an isosceles triangle, so two sides are equal. Let's call the triangle ABC, where AB = AC. The base is BC, which is 60 units long. The altitude from vertex A to the base BC will split the base into two equal parts, each 30 units. Let me denote the midpoint of BC as M. So, BM = MC = 30.Now, the center of the inscribed circle, which is called the incenter, is located along this altitude AM. The problem states that this incenter divides the altitude in the ratio 17:15. That means if I consider the segments from the vertex A to the incenter (let's call it O) and from the incenter to the midpoint M, their lengths are in the ratio 17:15.So, if I let the length of AO be 17k and OM be 15k, then the entire altitude AM would be AO + OM = 17k + 15k = 32k. Therefore, AM = 32k.I need to find the radius of the inscribed circle. The radius of the inscribed circle (r) in a triangle is given by the formula:[ r = frac{A}{s} ]where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter.But before I can use this formula, I need to find the area and the semi-perimeter of the triangle. To find the area, I need the base and the height. The base is given as 60, and the height is AM, which I've denoted as 32k. So, the area would be:[ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 60 times 32k = 960k ]Now, I need to find the semi-perimeter. For that, I need the lengths of all sides. I know the base is 60, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. Let me find the length of AB.Since ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, and M is the midpoint of BC, triangle ABM is a right-angled triangle with sides BM = 30, AM = 32k, and hypotenuse AB. Using the Pythagorean theorem:[ AB^2 = BM^2 + AM^2 ][ AB^2 = 30^2 + (32k)^2 ][ AB^2 = 900 + 1024k^2 ]So, AB = AC = (sqrt{900 + 1024k^2}).Now, the semi-perimeter (s) is:[ s = frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = frac{2 times sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 60}{2} = sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30 ]So, the radius r is:[ r = frac{960k}{sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30} ]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think about the inradius in an isosceles triangle.I remember that in any triangle, the inradius can also be expressed as:[ r = frac{text{Area}}{s} ]But I already have that. Maybe I can relate the segments AO and OM to the inradius.Wait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side of the triangle. In this case, since the incenter is on the altitude AM, the inradius should be equal to the distance from O to BC, which is the same as OM, right? Because OM is the segment from the incenter to the base BC.Wait, no. Actually, the inradius is the perpendicular distance from the incenter to any side, not necessarily the segment OM. But in this case, since O is on the altitude AM, which is perpendicular to BC, the length OM is indeed the inradius. Because the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the base, which is along the altitude.So, if OM is the inradius, then r = OM = 15k.But earlier, I had the formula for r as:[ r = frac{960k}{sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30} ]So, setting this equal to 15k:[ 15k = frac{960k}{sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30} ]I can cancel out k (assuming k ≠ 0, which it isn't because lengths are positive):[ 15 = frac{960}{sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30} ]Now, let's solve for k.Multiply both sides by the denominator:[ 15 times (sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30) = 960 ]Divide both sides by 15:[ sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} + 30 = 64 ]Subtract 30 from both sides:[ sqrt{900 + 1024k^2} = 34 ]Square both sides:[ 900 + 1024k^2 = 34^2 ][ 900 + 1024k^2 = 1156 ]Subtract 900 from both sides:[ 1024k^2 = 256 ]Divide both sides by 1024:[ k^2 = frac{256}{1024} = frac{1}{4} ]Take the square root:[ k = frac{1}{2} ]So, k = 0.5.Now, recall that the inradius r = OM = 15k = 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.Therefore, the radius of the inscribed circle is 7.5 units.Wait, let me double-check this. If k = 0.5, then the altitude AM = 32k = 16 units. So, the height of the triangle is 16. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, the equal sides AB and AC would be:[ AB = sqrt{30^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{900 + 256} = sqrt{1156} = 34 ]So, AB = AC = 34, and BC = 60. The semi-perimeter s is:[ s = frac{34 + 34 + 60}{2} = frac{128}{2} = 64 ]The area is:[ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 60 times 16 = 480 ]Then, the inradius r is:[ r = frac{text{Area}}{s} = frac{480}{64} = 7.5 ]Yes, that matches. So, the radius is indeed 7.5.I think that makes sense. The key was realizing that the inradius is equal to OM, which is 15k, and then setting up the equation using the area and semi-perimeter to solve for k. Once I found k, plugging it back gave me the inradius.**Final Answer**The radius of the inscribed circle is boxed{7.5}."},{"question":"A 90 cm long wire is to be cut into two pieces so that one piece will be some fraction of the other.

Hmm, I remember that square roots can only take non-negative numbers, right? So, the expression inside the square root has to be greater than or equal to zero. That makes sense because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. Alright, so if I have sqrt(x + 3), the part inside the square root is (x + 3). To make sure this is meaningful, I need to set up an inequality where (x + 3) is greater than or equal to zero. Let me write that down:x + 3 ≥ 0Now, I need to solve this inequality for x. That should be straightforward. I'll subtract 3 from both sides to isolate x:x + 3 - 3 ≥ 0 - 3Simplifying that, I get:x ≥ -3So, this means that x has to be greater than or equal to -3 for the square root to be meaningful. Let me double-check that. If x is -3, then x + 3 is 0, and sqrt(0) is 0, which is fine. If x is greater than -3, like -2, then x + 3 is 1, and sqrt(1) is 1, which is also fine. What if x is less than -3, say -4? Then x + 3 would be -1, and sqrt(-1) isn't a real number. So, yeah, x has to be at least -3.I think that's it. So, the range of values for x is all real numbers greater than or equal to -3."},{"question":"Definition: If for any positive integer n, a sequence {a_n} satisfies |a_{n+1}| + |a_n| = d (where d is a constant), then {a_n} is called an \\"absolute sum sequence,\\" and d is called the \\"absolute common sum.\\" Given an \\"absolute sum sequence\\" {a_n} where a_1 = 2 and the \\"absolute common sum\\" d = 2, the minimum value of the sum of the first 2012 terms S_{2012} is.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an \\"absolute sum sequence.\\" The definition says that for any positive integer ( n ), the sequence ( {a_n} ) satisfies ( |a_{n+1}| + |a_n| = d ), where ( d ) is a constant. They call this an \\"absolute sum sequence,\\" and ( d ) is the \\"absolute common sum.\\" Given that ( a_1 = 2 ) and ( d = 2 ), I need to find the minimum value of the sum of the first 2012 terms, ( S_{2012} ). Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let's understand the recurrence relation: ( |a_{n+1}| + |a_n| = 2 ). This means that the absolute value of each term plus the absolute value of the next term is always 2. So, starting from ( a_1 = 2 ), what can ( a_2 ) be?Well, ( |a_2| + |a_1| = 2 ) implies ( |a_2| + 2 = 2 ), so ( |a_2| = 0 ). That means ( a_2 = 0 ). Okay, so ( a_2 ) must be zero.Now, moving on to ( a_3 ). Using the same relation, ( |a_3| + |a_2| = 2 ). Since ( a_2 = 0 ), this simplifies to ( |a_3| = 2 ). So, ( a_3 ) can be either 2 or -2. Hmm, interesting. So, it's not fixed; it can be positive or negative.Similarly, ( |a_4| + |a_3| = 2 ). If ( a_3 = 2 ), then ( |a_4| + 2 = 2 ) implies ( |a_4| = 0 ), so ( a_4 = 0 ). If ( a_3 = -2 ), then ( |a_4| + 2 = 2 ) still implies ( |a_4| = 0 ), so ( a_4 = 0 ) regardless. So, ( a_4 = 0 ).Continuing this pattern, ( |a_5| + |a_4| = 2 ). Since ( a_4 = 0 ), ( |a_5| = 2 ), so ( a_5 ) can be 2 or -2. It seems like every odd term can be either 2 or -2, and every even term is 0. Let me write this out for the first few terms:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = 0 )- ( a_3 = pm 2 )- ( a_4 = 0 )- ( a_5 = pm 2 )- ( a_6 = 0 )- ( a_7 = pm 2 )- ( a_8 = 0 )- And so on...So, the sequence alternates between 0 and either 2 or -2. Since we're looking to minimize the sum ( S_{2012} ), we should choose the negative values as much as possible for the terms that can be negative. That is, we want as many of the odd-indexed terms (starting from ( a_3 )) to be -2 instead of 2.Let's figure out how many terms we can set to -2. The sequence has 2012 terms, so let's see how many odd and even terms there are.Since 2012 is an even number, the number of odd terms is 1006 (from ( a_1 ) to ( a_{2011} )) and the number of even terms is 1006 (from ( a_2 ) to ( a_{2012} )). But wait, actually, starting from ( a_1 ), which is odd, the odd terms are ( a_1, a_3, a_5, ldots, a_{2011} ). Let's count them:The number of odd terms is ( frac{2012}{2} = 1006 ). Similarly, the number of even terms is also 1006.But ( a_1 ) is fixed at 2, so we can't change that. So, starting from ( a_3 ), we have 1005 terms that can be either 2 or -2 (since ( a_3, a_5, ldots, a_{2011} ) are the ones we can choose). Therefore, we have 1005 terms that can be set to -2 to minimize the sum.So, let's compute the sum:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = 0 )- ( a_3 = -2 )- ( a_4 = 0 )- ( a_5 = -2 )- ( a_6 = 0 )- ( ldots )- ( a_{2011} = -2 )- ( a_{2012} = 0 )So, the sum ( S_{2012} ) is:( S_{2012} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + ldots + a_{2012} )Breaking it down:- The sum of all odd terms: ( a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + ldots + a_{2011} )- The sum of all even terms: ( a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_{2012} )Since all even terms are 0, their sum is 0. So, the total sum is just the sum of the odd terms.The odd terms are:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_3 = -2 )- ( a_5 = -2 )- ( ldots )- ( a_{2011} = -2 )There are 1006 odd terms in total. Out of these, ( a_1 = 2 ) and the remaining 1005 terms are each -2.So, the sum of the odd terms is:( 2 + (-2) times 1005 )Calculating that:( 2 - 2010 = -2008 )Therefore, the minimum value of ( S_{2012} ) is -2008.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with ( a_1 = 2 ), each subsequent odd term can be -2, and the even terms are 0. So, over 2012 terms, we have 1006 odd terms. The first odd term is 2, and the rest 1005 can be -2. So, the sum is indeed ( 2 + (1005 times -2) = 2 - 2010 = -2008 ). Yeah, that seems right.I think that's the minimum because if we set as many of the variable terms to -2 as possible, we get the smallest possible sum. If we had set some of them to 2 instead, the sum would be larger. So, yeah, -2008 is the minimum.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( S_{2012} ) is boxed{-2008}."},{"question":"Matthew, the baker, arrives at work early every morning to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes for the day.

Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that for the equation x² + a x + b = 167y to have integer solutions, it means that for some integers x and y, the left side must be divisible by 167. So, essentially, x² + a x + b must be a multiple of 167. That makes me think about modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 167.So, if I rewrite the equation modulo 167, I get x² + a x + b ≡ 0 mod 167. This is a quadratic congruence. Now, quadratic congruences can have solutions depending on the discriminant. The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c is b² - 4ac. In this case, the discriminant would be a² - 4b. For the quadratic to have solutions modulo 167, the discriminant must be a quadratic residue modulo 167.Wait, what's a quadratic residue? A quadratic residue modulo a prime p is an integer q such that there exists some integer x with x² ≡ q mod p. So, for our case, a² - 4b must be a quadratic residue modulo 167. Since 167 is a prime number, I can use properties of quadratic residues.I remember that for an odd prime p, there are (p + 1)/2 quadratic residues modulo p, including zero. So, for p = 167, there are (167 + 1)/2 = 84 quadratic residues. That means there are 84 possible values for a² - 4b modulo 167.So, for each a, the value a² - 4b must be congruent to one of these 84 quadratic residues modulo 167. Therefore, for each a, there are 84 possible values of b that satisfy this condition. But wait, b is also bounded between 1 and 2004. So, I need to consider how many times these residues repeat over the range of b.Since 2004 divided by 167 is approximately 12 (because 167 * 12 = 2004), that means each residue modulo 167 will occur exactly 12 times in the range of b from 1 to 2004. Therefore, for each a, there are 84 * 12 = 1008 possible values of b.But hold on, a is also ranging from 1 to 2004. So, for each of the 2004 values of a, there are 1008 corresponding values of b. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (a, b) would be 2004 * 1008.Let me calculate that: 2004 * 1008. Hmm, 2004 * 1000 is 2,004,000, and 2004 * 8 is 16,032. So, adding them together gives 2,004,000 + 16,032 = 2,020,032.Wait, but I should double-check if my reasoning about the residues is correct. I assumed that for each a, there are 84 residues, each occurring 12 times in b. But is that accurate?Let me think. For each a, a² - 4b must be a quadratic residue modulo 167. Since b ranges over 2004 numbers, and 2004 is a multiple of 167 (167 * 12 = 2004), the values of b modulo 167 cycle every 167 numbers. Therefore, for each residue class modulo 167, there are exactly 12 values of b in the range 1 to 2004.Therefore, for each a, the equation a² - 4b ≡ quadratic residue mod 167 will have 84 solutions for b modulo 167, each corresponding to 12 actual values of b. So, 84 * 12 = 1008 solutions for b for each a.Since a also ranges from 1 to 2004, and each a is independent, the total number of ordered pairs is indeed 2004 * 1008 = 2,020,032.But just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any overlaps or cases where a² - 4b could be the same for different a's or b's. However, since a and b are independent variables, each pair (a, b) is unique as long as a and b satisfy the condition. So, even if different a's lead to the same quadratic residue, each combination is still counted separately.Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. The total number of ordered integer pairs (a, b) is 2,020,032.**Final Answer**The number of ordered integer pairs ((a, b)) is boxed{2020032}."},{"question":"Calculate: 2 times (-3)^{3} - 4 times (-3) + 15.","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the exponent in the expression (2 times (-3)^{3} - 4 times (-3) + 15).

There are four students—Petya, Vasya, Tolya, and Dima—each making a statement about these digits. The catch is that exactly one of them is mistaken. I need to figure out what X is.Let me start by listing out the statements:1. **Petya**: \\"The largest digit in the number X is B.\\"2. **Vasya**: \\"C = 8.\\"3. **Tolya**: \\"The largest digit is C.\\"4. **Dima**: \\"C is the arithmetic mean of the digits A and B.\\"So, exactly one of these four statements is wrong, and the rest are correct. My goal is to find the number X, which is a three-digit number with digits A, B, and C, all different from each other.First, I should consider the possibilities for which statement might be the incorrect one. Since only one is wrong, the other three must be true. Let me go through each possibility.**Case 1: Suppose Petya is wrong.**If Petya is wrong, then the largest digit is not B. So, either A or C is the largest digit. Let's see what the other statements say.- Vasya says C = 8.- Tolya says the largest digit is C.- Dima says C is the arithmetic mean of A and B.If Vasya is correct, then C = 8. If Tolya is correct, then C is the largest digit, which would mean C = 8 is the largest. If Dima is correct, then 8 is the average of A and B, so A + B = 16.Now, since C is the largest digit (8), and all digits are different, A and B must be less than 8. But Dima says A + B = 16. If both A and B are less than 8, their maximum sum would be 7 + 6 = 13, which is less than 16. That's a contradiction because 16 is too big for two digits less than 8. So, this case leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Petya cannot be the one who's wrong.**Case 2: Suppose Vasya is wrong.**If Vasya is wrong, then C ≠ 8. Let's see what the other statements say.- Petya says the largest digit is B.- Tolya says the largest digit is C.- Dima says C is the arithmetic mean of A and B.If both Petya and Tolya are correct, then the largest digit would have to be both B and C, which is impossible unless B = C, but all digits are different. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, if Vasya is wrong, both Petya and Tolya can't be correct, which would mean more than one mistake, which isn't allowed. So, Vasya can't be the one who's wrong.**Case 3: Suppose Tolya is wrong.**If Tolya is wrong, then the largest digit is not C. Let's see what the other statements say.- Petya says the largest digit is B.- Vasya says C = 8.- Dima says C is the arithmetic mean of A and B.If Petya is correct, then B is the largest digit. If Vasya is correct, then C = 8. If Dima is correct, then C = (A + B)/2, so A + B = 16.Since B is the largest digit, and C = 8, then B must be greater than 8. The only digit greater than 8 is 9. So, B = 9.Now, A + B = 16, and B = 9, so A = 16 - 9 = 7.So, A = 7, B = 9, C = 8. Let's check if all digits are different: 7, 9, 8 are all different. Good.Also, the largest digit is B = 9, which matches Petya's statement. C = 8, which matches Vasya's statement. C is the average of A and B: (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which matches Dima's statement.So, in this case, only Tolya is wrong, which fits the condition that exactly one student is mistaken. Therefore, this seems to be the correct scenario.**Case 4: Suppose Dima is wrong.**If Dima is wrong, then C is not the arithmetic mean of A and B. Let's see what the other statements say.- Petya says the largest digit is B.- Vasya says C = 8.- Tolya says the largest digit is C.If Vasya is correct, then C = 8. If Tolya is correct, then C is the largest digit, so C = 8 is the largest. If Petya is correct, then B is the largest digit, which would mean B = 8 as well, but all digits are different. So, that's a contradiction because B and C can't both be 8. Therefore, if Dima is wrong, both Tolya and Petya can't be correct, which would mean more than one mistake, which isn't allowed. So, Dima can't be the one who's wrong.So, after checking all four cases, only Case 3 works: Tolya is wrong, and the number is 798.I think that's the solution. Let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't miss anything.- A = 7, B = 9, C = 8.- Petya: Largest digit is B (9). Correct.- Vasya: C = 8. Correct.- Tolya: Largest digit is C (8). Incorrect.- Dima: C is the mean of A and B. (7 + 9)/2 = 8. Correct.Yes, that all checks out. Only Tolya is wrong, which is exactly one mistake. So, the number must be 798.**Final Answer**The number ( X ) is boxed{798}."},{"question":"John works at 2 different hospitals.  At the first hospital, he sees 20 different patients each day.

I'll denote this average weight as ( W_A ) kg.Section A has 40 students, so the total weight for section A is ( 40 times W_A ) kg.Section B has 20 students with an average weight of 40 kg, so the total weight for section B is ( 20 times 40 = 800 ) kg.The total number of students in the class is ( 40 + 20 = 60 ) students.The average weight of the entire class is 46.67 kg, so the total weight for the entire class is ( 60 times 46.67 = 2800.2 ) kg.Now, I'll set up the equation that combines the total weights of both sections to equal the total weight of the class:[40W_A + 800 = 2800.2]To solve for ( W_A ), I'll subtract 800 from both sides of the equation:[40W_A = 2000.2]Next, I'll divide both sides by 40 to find ( W_A ):[W_A = frac{2000.2}{40} = 50.005]Therefore, the average weight of section A is 50.005 kg."},{"question":"Vasya has:a) 2 different volumes from the collected works of A.S.

Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's list out all the books Vasya has:a) 2 different volumes from the collected works of A.S. Pushkin, each 30 cm high.b) 4 volumes of works by E.V. Tarle, each 25 cm high.c) 1 book of lyrical poems by Vasya himself, 40 cm high.So, in total, that's 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 books.Vasya wants to arrange these books on a shelf with his own book in the center. Also, the books located at the same distance from his book on both the left and the right should have equal heights.Alright, so the shelf will have 7 positions, with the center position occupied by Vasya's book. That leaves 3 positions on the left and 3 positions on the right.The key condition here is that the books at the same distance from the center must have equal heights. So, the first position to the left and the first position to the right must have books of the same height, the second position to the left and the second to the right must have the same height, and so on.Given that, let's think about how to arrange the books.First, Vasya's book is fixed in the center. So, we don't need to worry about that. Now, we have 6 remaining books to arrange: 2 Pushkin volumes (30 cm each), 4 Tarle volumes (25 cm each), and we already placed Vasya's book.But wait, the Pushkin volumes are different, so they are distinguishable, whereas the Tarle volumes are identical in height but are they different books? The problem says \\"a set of works by E.V. Tarle in 4 volumes,\\" so I think they are different books but all 25 cm high.So, we have:- 2 different Pushkin books (30 cm each)- 4 different Tarle books (25 cm each)- 1 Vasya's book (40 cm)So, in total, 7 distinct books, but with some having the same height.Now, the arrangement needs to satisfy that the books equidistant from the center have equal heights.So, the first position on the left and the first on the right must have the same height.Similarly, the second on the left and the second on the right must have the same height, and the third on the left and the third on the right must have the same height.Given that, we need to assign heights to these symmetric positions.Given the heights available:- 40 cm (Vasya's book, fixed in the center)- 30 cm (Pushkin books)- 25 cm (Tarle books)So, the heights we can use for the symmetric positions are 30 cm and 25 cm.But we have only 2 Pushkin books (30 cm) and 4 Tarle books (25 cm).So, we need to decide how to distribute these heights across the symmetric positions.Since we have 3 symmetric pairs (positions 1-7, 2-6, 3-5), each pair needs to have the same height.Given that, we can have some pairs as 30 cm and others as 25 cm.But we only have 2 Pushkin books, which are 30 cm. So, we can have at most 2 pairs with 30 cm.Wait, but each pair requires two books of the same height.So, if we use a pair for 30 cm, that would require 2 books, which we have exactly.Similarly, for 25 cm, we have 4 books, so we can have two pairs of 25 cm.Wait, let's see:Total symmetric pairs: 3Each pair needs two books of the same height.We have:- 2 books of 30 cm- 4 books of 25 cmSo, we can assign one pair to be 30 cm (using both Pushkin books) and the remaining two pairs to be 25 cm (using four Tarle books).Alternatively, we could assign two pairs to be 30 cm, but we only have two books, so that would require four 30 cm books, which we don't have.Therefore, the only possible way is to have one pair of 30 cm and two pairs of 25 cm.So, the arrangement will have:- One pair (positions x and 8-x) with 30 cm books- Two pairs with 25 cm booksNow, we need to decide which symmetric pair is assigned to 30 cm.There are 3 symmetric pairs:1. Positions 1 and 72. Positions 2 and 63. Positions 3 and 5So, we can choose any one of these three pairs to be 30 cm.Once we choose which pair is 30 cm, the remaining two pairs will be 25 cm.Now, for each of these choices, we need to calculate the number of arrangements.First, choose which symmetric pair is assigned to 30 cm. There are 3 choices.For each choice:- The 30 cm pair: We have 2 different Pushkin books. Since the pair consists of two positions, we can arrange the two Pushkin books in 2! ways.- The 25 cm pairs: We have 4 different Tarle books. We need to assign them to the two pairs, each consisting of two positions.But wait, each pair is two positions, so for each 25 cm pair, we need to assign two books.Since we have two pairs, we need to divide the 4 Tarle books into two groups of two, and assign each group to a pair.However, since the pairs are symmetric, the order of assigning the groups to the pairs doesn't matter.Wait, actually, the pairs are fixed in their positions, so the assignment matters.Wait, no, the pairs are fixed in their positions, so assigning different books to different pairs will result in different arrangements.So, let's think about it.We have 4 Tarle books: let's call them T1, T2, T3, T4.We need to assign them to two pairs, each pair having two books.Each pair is a specific set of positions, say positions 1 and 7, positions 2 and 6, etc.But since we've already fixed which pair is 30 cm, the remaining two pairs are fixed in their positions.So, for each remaining pair, we need to assign two Tarle books.So, for the first remaining pair, we can choose any two Tarle books, and arrange them in the two positions.Similarly, for the second remaining pair, we assign the remaining two Tarle books.But since the pairs are fixed in their positions, the order matters.So, the number of ways to assign the Tarle books is:First, choose two books out of four for the first pair, then arrange them in the two positions.Then, the remaining two books go to the second pair, and arrange them in their two positions.So, the number of ways is:C(4,2) * 2! * C(2,2) * 2! = (6) * 2 * 1 * 2 = 24.But wait, actually, since the pairs are fixed in their positions, we don't need to multiply by the number of ways to choose which pair gets which books, because the pairs are fixed.Wait, no, actually, the pairs are fixed in their positions, so once we've chosen which pair is 30 cm, the remaining two pairs are fixed as well.Therefore, for each of those two pairs, we need to assign two books.So, for the first remaining pair, we choose two books out of four and arrange them, then for the second pair, we arrange the remaining two.So, the number of ways is:C(4,2) * 2! * C(2,2) * 2! = 6 * 2 * 1 * 2 = 24.But wait, actually, since the pairs are fixed in their positions, we don't need to consider the order of assigning the books to the pairs, because each pair is a specific set of positions.Wait, no, actually, the pairs are fixed, so assigning different books to different pairs will result in different arrangements.Therefore, the number of ways is indeed 24.But let's think differently.We have 4 Tarle books, and we need to arrange them in 4 positions, which are two pairs of symmetric positions.Each pair is two positions.So, the number of ways to arrange 4 distinct books in 4 positions is 4!.But since the pairs are symmetric, we need to consider that swapping the books within a pair doesn't change the arrangement.Wait, no, actually, the books are distinct, so swapping them within a pair does change the arrangement.Therefore, the number of ways is 4!.But wait, let's see.If we have two pairs, each with two positions, and we need to assign four distinct books to these four positions.Each pair is symmetric, but the books are distinct, so the order within each pair matters.Therefore, the number of ways is 4! = 24.Yes, that makes sense.So, for each choice of which pair is 30 cm, we have:- 2! ways to arrange the Pushkin books in that pair.- 4! ways to arrange the Tarle books in the remaining pairs.Therefore, for each of the 3 choices of which pair is 30 cm, we have 2! * 4! arrangements.So, total number of arrangements is 3 * 2! * 4!.Calculating that:3 * 2 * 24 = 3 * 48 = 144.So, the total number of ways is 144.Looking back at the options:a) 3 · 2! · 4! = 3 * 2 * 24 = 144b) 2! · 3! = 2 * 6 = 12c) 51 / (3! · 2!) = 51 / (6 * 2) = 51 / 12 = 4.25d) none of the above answers are correct.So, option a) is 144, which matches our calculation.Therefore, the correct answer is a)."},{"question":"The points (1, -2) and (-3, 5) are adjacent vertices of a square.

This subset ( W ) needs to satisfy two conditions: first, it should have at least ( 0.45m^{frac{4}{5}} ) triangles, and second, there shouldn't be six points ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) such that all the triangles ( ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF, EFA, ) and ( FAB ) are in ( W ).Okay, so let's break this down. The first condition is about the size of ( W ), and the second condition is about avoiding a specific configuration of six triangles forming a cycle. This seems related to avoiding certain substructures, maybe something like a hexagon in terms of triangles.I remember that in combinatorics, when we need to ensure a certain property while maintaining a minimum size, probabilistic methods can be useful. Maybe I can use the probabilistic method here. Specifically, the alteration technique, where I randomly select elements and then remove those that cause problems.So, let's think about selecting each triangle in ( U ) with some probability ( p ). The expected number of triangles in ( W ) would then be ( pm ). But I also need to ensure that there are no bad configurations, like the six triangles forming a cycle.Each bad configuration involves six specific triangles. The probability that all six are selected is ( p^6 ). So, the expected number of such bad configurations would be related to the number of possible 6-tuples of points. Wait, how many such 6-tuples are there?Actually, the number of 6-tuples of points isn't directly given, but since we're dealing with triangles, each triangle has three points. So, a cycle of six triangles would involve six points, each connected in a cyclic manner. The number of such cycles might be related to the number of ways to choose six points and arrange them cyclically.But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the number of bad configurations is bounded by something like ( m^2 ), since each triangle is defined by three points, and a cycle would involve multiple triangles sharing edges.If I assume that the number of bad configurations is roughly ( m^2 ), then the expected number of bad configurations in ( W ) would be ( m^2 p^6 ). To ensure that this expectation is less than something manageable, I need to choose ( p ) such that ( m^2 p^6 ) is small.But I also need to keep the expected size of ( W ) as large as possible, at least ( 0.45m^{frac{4}{5}} ). So, I need to balance between ( pm ) being large and ( m^2 p^6 ) being small.Let me set up an equation to find the right ( p ). Suppose I want ( pm ) to be about ( 0.45m^{frac{4}{5}} ). Then, ( p ) should be roughly ( 0.45m^{-frac{1}{5}} ).Now, plugging this into the expected number of bad configurations: ( m^2 p^6 = m^2 (0.45m^{-frac{1}{5}})^6 = m^2 cdot 0.45^6 cdot m^{-frac{6}{5}} = 0.45^6 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).Hmm, so the expected number of bad configurations is proportional to ( m^{frac{4}{5}} ), which is the same order as the expected size of ( W ). That might not be sufficient because if I have to remove one triangle from each bad configuration, I could potentially remove a significant number of triangles, possibly reducing ( W ) below the desired size.Maybe I need a better way to estimate the number of bad configurations. Perhaps instead of ( m^2 ), it's actually less. Since each bad configuration involves six specific triangles, and each triangle is part of multiple configurations, maybe the number is actually ( O(m^2) ), but with a smaller constant.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lovász Local Lemma or some other probabilistic tool to show that with positive probability, there exists a subset ( W ) that avoids all bad configurations and has the desired size.But I'm not too familiar with the Lovász Local Lemma, so maybe I should stick with the alteration method. Let's try to refine the calculation.Suppose each bad configuration is a set of six triangles forming a cycle. How many such configurations are there? For each set of six points, there might be multiple cycles, but the number of cycles per six points is limited. Maybe it's something like ( (6-1)! = 120 ) for each set of six points, but that seems high.Alternatively, perhaps for each triangle, the number of cycles it can be part of is limited. If each triangle can be part of a certain number of cycles, then the total number of cycles is bounded by ( m ) times that number.But I'm not sure about the exact count. Maybe I should proceed with the initial estimate and see where it leads.If I set ( p = cm^{-frac{1}{5}} ) for some constant ( c ), then ( pm = cm^{frac{4}{5}} ), which matches the desired size. The expected number of bad configurations would be ( m^2 p^6 = m^2 c^6 m^{-frac{6}{5}} = c^6 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).So, the expected number of bad configurations is proportional to ( m^{frac{4}{5}} ), which is the same as the expected size of ( W ). That suggests that if I remove one triangle from each bad configuration, I might end up removing a significant fraction of ( W ), possibly too much.Maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps instead of removing one triangle per bad configuration, I can find a way to bound the number of triangles that need to be removed more efficiently.Alternatively, maybe I can use a more sophisticated probabilistic argument, like considering dependencies between bad configurations and using the Lovász Local Lemma to show that with positive probability, no bad configuration exists.But I'm not entirely sure how to apply the Lovász Local Lemma here. Let me recall: the Lovász Local Lemma states that if each bad event is independent of all but a few other bad events, and the probability of each bad event is small enough, then the probability that none of the bad events occur is positive.In this case, each bad configuration is a bad event, and two bad configurations are dependent if they share a triangle. So, each bad configuration depends on other configurations that share a triangle with it.How many other configurations share a triangle with a given configuration? For a given bad configuration (a cycle of six triangles), how many other cycles share at least one triangle with it?Each triangle in the cycle could be part of multiple other cycles. It's not immediately clear, but perhaps the number of dependencies is manageable.If I can bound the number of dependencies and show that the probability of each bad configuration is small enough, then the Lovász Local Lemma might apply.But I'm not sure about the exact calculations here. Maybe I should look for another way.Wait, perhaps instead of using the Lovász Local Lemma, I can use the probabilistic method with alteration, but more carefully.Suppose I select each triangle with probability ( p ), and then remove one triangle from each bad configuration. The expected number of triangles removed is the expected number of bad configurations, which is ( m^2 p^6 ).So, the expected size of ( W ) after removal is ( pm - m^2 p^6 ).I want this to be at least ( 0.45 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).So, set ( pm - m^2 p^6 geq 0.45 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).Let me set ( p = c m^{-frac{1}{5}} ), then ( pm = c m^{frac{4}{5}} ), and ( m^2 p^6 = m^2 c^6 m^{-frac{6}{5}} = c^6 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).So, the inequality becomes ( c m^{frac{4}{5}} - c^6 m^{frac{4}{5}} geq 0.45 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).Dividing both sides by ( m^{frac{4}{5}} ), we get ( c - c^6 geq 0.45 ).Now, I need to find a constant ( c ) such that ( c - c^6 geq 0.45 ).Let me try ( c = 0.5 ). Then, ( 0.5 - 0.5^6 = 0.5 - 0.015625 = 0.484375 ), which is greater than 0.45.So, ( c = 0.5 ) works. Therefore, setting ( p = 0.5 m^{-frac{1}{5}} ), the expected size of ( W ) after removal is at least ( 0.45 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).Therefore, there exists a subset ( W ) satisfying both conditions.Wait, but I need to make sure that the number of bad configurations is indeed ( m^2 p^6 ). Is that accurate?Actually, the number of possible 6-tuples of triangles is more than ( m^2 ), because each bad configuration involves six specific triangles. So, the number of bad configurations is actually ( O(m^2) ), but with a larger constant.But since I'm using the probabilistic method, and I'm only concerned with the expectation, as long as the expectation is manageable, the alteration method should still work.So, with ( p = 0.5 m^{-frac{1}{5}} ), the expected number of bad configurations is ( O(m^{frac{4}{5}}) ), which is the same order as the expected size of ( W ). Therefore, removing one triangle from each bad configuration reduces the size of ( W ) by ( O(m^{frac{4}{5}}) ), but since we started with ( O(m^{frac{4}{5}}) ), we need to ensure that the reduction doesn't bring it below ( 0.45 m^{frac{4}{5}} ).Given that ( c - c^6 geq 0.45 ) holds for ( c = 0.5 ), the expected size after removal is sufficient.Therefore, by the probabilistic method, such a subset ( W ) exists.I think this approach makes sense. I might have glossed over some details, like the exact number of bad configurations, but the overall strategy seems sound. Using the probabilistic method with alteration allows me to show the existence of such a subset without explicitly constructing it."},{"question":"The ratio of irises to roses in Nikki's garden is 3:7.

If x_0 is in the interval (k, k+1), then the integer value of k is ( ).A: 1  B: 2  C: 3  D: 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find where the graphs of y = ln x and y = -2x + 6 intersect. The question tells me that the x-coordinate of the intersection point, which is x₀, lies in the interval (k, k+1), and I need to find the integer k. The options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I know that to find the intersection point of two functions, I need to set them equal to each other. So, I can set ln x equal to -2x + 6. That gives me the equation:ln x = -2x + 6I need to solve for x here. But wait, this equation has both a logarithmic term and a linear term. I don't think I can solve this algebraically because it's a transcendental equation. So, maybe I need to use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the solution.But since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can test the given intervals to see where the solution lies. The options for k are 1, 2, 3, 4, so the intervals would be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and (4,5). I need to figure out in which of these intervals the solution x₀ lies.Let me think about the behavior of both functions. The function y = ln x is defined for x > 0, and it increases slowly as x increases. On the other hand, y = -2x + 6 is a straight line with a negative slope, so it decreases as x increases.At x = 1, ln 1 = 0, and y = -2(1) + 6 = 4. So, at x = 1, ln x is 0 and the line is at 4. So, the line is above the logarithm function here.At x = 2, ln 2 is approximately 0.693, and y = -2(2) + 6 = 2. So, ln 2 ≈ 0.693 < 2. Still, the line is above the logarithm.At x = 3, ln 3 is approximately 1.098, and y = -2(3) + 6 = 0. So, ln 3 ≈ 1.098 > 0. Here, the logarithm function is above the line.Wait, so at x = 2, the line is above the logarithm, but at x = 3, the logarithm is above the line. That means somewhere between x = 2 and x = 3, the two functions cross each other. So, the intersection point x₀ must be between 2 and 3.Therefore, x₀ is in the interval (2,3), which means k is 2. So, the answer should be B:2.But just to be thorough, let me check the values at x = 2.5 to see where exactly the crossing might be.At x = 2.5, ln(2.5) is approximately 0.916, and y = -2(2.5) + 6 = -5 + 6 = 1. So, ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916 < 1. So, the line is still above the logarithm at x = 2.5.Wait, so at x = 2.5, the line is still above the logarithm. So, maybe the crossing is between x = 2.5 and x = 3.Let me try x = 2.75.ln(2.75) is approximately 1.013, and y = -2(2.75) + 6 = -5.5 + 6 = 0.5. So, ln(2.75) ≈ 1.013 > 0.5. So, now the logarithm is above the line. So, between x = 2.5 and x = 2.75, the functions cross.So, x₀ is between 2.5 and 2.75, which is still within (2,3). So, k is 2.Alternatively, I could have used the Intermediate Value Theorem. Let me define a function f(x) = ln x + 2x - 6. Then, the roots of f(x) correspond to the solutions of ln x = -2x + 6.So, f(x) = ln x + 2x - 6.We can check the sign of f(x) at x = 2 and x = 3.At x = 2, f(2) = ln 2 + 4 - 6 ≈ 0.693 - 2 ≈ -1.307 < 0.At x = 3, f(3) = ln 3 + 6 - 6 ≈ 1.098 > 0.Since f(2) is negative and f(3) is positive, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a c in (2,3) such that f(c) = 0. Therefore, x₀ is in (2,3), so k is 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer is B:2."},{"question":"Given that tan{alpha} = 2. Find:1. The value of tan{(alpha + frac{pi}{4})};2. The value of frac{4sin{alpha} + 3cos{(pi - alpha)}}{sin{(pi + alpha)} + cos{(-alpha)}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that the tangent of alpha is 2, and I need to find two things. First, the value of tan(alpha + pi/4), and second, the value of this fraction: (4 sin alpha + 3 cos(pi - alpha)) divided by (sin(pi + alpha) + cos(-alpha)). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.Starting with the first part: tan(alpha + pi/4). I remember there's a tangent addition formula. Let me recall what it is. I think it's tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I apply this formula to tan(alpha + pi/4), then A is alpha and B is pi/4. So, tan(alpha + pi/4) should be (tan alpha + tan(pi/4)) divided by (1 - tan alpha tan(pi/4)).I know that tan(pi/4) is 1, because tan of 45 degrees is 1. So substituting the values I have, tan(alpha) is 2, so plugging that in, it becomes (2 + 1) divided by (1 - 2*1). That simplifies to 3 divided by (1 - 2), which is 3 divided by (-1), so that should be -3. Okay, so the first part is -3. That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to the second part: (4 sin alpha + 3 cos(pi - alpha)) divided by (sin(pi + alpha) + cos(-alpha)). Hmm, this looks a bit more complicated. I think I need to simplify the trigonometric expressions in the numerator and the denominator first.Let me recall some trigonometric identities. For cos(pi - alpha), I think that's equal to -cos alpha. Yeah, because cosine is an even function, but when you have pi minus alpha, it's in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. So, cos(pi - alpha) = -cos alpha.Similarly, for sin(pi + alpha), I remember that sine is an odd function, and sin(pi + alpha) is equal to -sin alpha. Because adding pi to an angle reflects it to the opposite side, making sine negative.And for cos(-alpha), since cosine is an even function, cos(-alpha) is equal to cos alpha. So, putting all these together, let's rewrite the numerator and denominator.Starting with the numerator: 4 sin alpha + 3 cos(pi - alpha). Substituting cos(pi - alpha) with -cos alpha, this becomes 4 sin alpha + 3*(-cos alpha), which simplifies to 4 sin alpha - 3 cos alpha.Now, the denominator: sin(pi + alpha) + cos(-alpha). Substituting sin(pi + alpha) with -sin alpha and cos(-alpha) with cos alpha, this becomes -sin alpha + cos alpha.So, now the entire expression becomes (4 sin alpha - 3 cos alpha) divided by (-sin alpha + cos alpha). Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to evaluate this expression given that tan alpha is 2.I remember that tan alpha is sin alpha over cos alpha, so tan alpha = 2 implies that sin alpha / cos alpha = 2. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sin alpha or cos alpha. Alternatively, I can divide both numerator and denominator by cos alpha to express everything in terms of tan alpha.Let me try that. If I divide numerator and denominator by cos alpha, then:Numerator: (4 sin alpha - 3 cos alpha) / cos alpha = 4 (sin alpha / cos alpha) - 3 = 4 tan alpha - 3.Denominator: (-sin alpha + cos alpha) / cos alpha = - (sin alpha / cos alpha) + 1 = -tan alpha + 1.So, now the expression becomes (4 tan alpha - 3) divided by (-tan alpha + 1). Since we know tan alpha is 2, we can substitute that in.Substituting tan alpha = 2, the numerator becomes 4*2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5. The denominator becomes -2 + 1 = -1. So, the entire expression is 5 divided by -1, which is -5.Wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, for the numerator: 4 sin alpha + 3 cos(pi - alpha). Cos(pi - alpha) is indeed -cos alpha, so 4 sin alpha - 3 cos alpha. That seems correct.Denominator: sin(pi + alpha) + cos(-alpha). Sin(pi + alpha) is -sin alpha, and cos(-alpha) is cos alpha, so -sin alpha + cos alpha. That also seems correct.Then, dividing numerator and denominator by cos alpha: numerator becomes 4 tan alpha - 3, denominator becomes -tan alpha + 1. Substituting tan alpha = 2, numerator is 8 - 3 = 5, denominator is -2 + 1 = -1. So, 5 / (-1) = -5. Yeah, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this without using the tangent addition formula for the first part. Let me see. If tan alpha = 2, then I can represent alpha as an angle in a right triangle where the opposite side is 2 and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5). Therefore, sin alpha = 2 / sqrt(5) and cos alpha = 1 / sqrt(5).Using these values, I can compute tan(alpha + pi/4). Let's see, tan(alpha + pi/4) = (tan alpha + tan(pi/4)) / (1 - tan alpha tan(pi/4)) = (2 + 1) / (1 - 2*1) = 3 / (-1) = -3. So, same result as before. That's reassuring.For the second part, using sin alpha = 2 / sqrt(5) and cos alpha = 1 / sqrt(5), let's compute the numerator and denominator directly.Numerator: 4 sin alpha - 3 cos alpha = 4*(2 / sqrt(5)) - 3*(1 / sqrt(5)) = (8 / sqrt(5)) - (3 / sqrt(5)) = (8 - 3) / sqrt(5) = 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5).Denominator: -sin alpha + cos alpha = -(2 / sqrt(5)) + (1 / sqrt(5)) = (-2 + 1) / sqrt(5) = (-1) / sqrt(5).So, the entire expression is (sqrt(5)) / (-1 / sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5) * (-sqrt(5)) = -5. Same result again. Okay, so that confirms it.I think I've got it right. The first part is -3, and the second part is -5. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel confident about it.**Final Answer**1. boxed{-3}2. boxed{-5}"},{"question":"Given a trapezoid ABCD and a point M on the lateral side AB such that DM perp AB. It turns out that MC = CD. Find the length of the upper base BC if AD = d.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this trapezoid problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. We have a trapezoid (ABCD), and there's a point (M) on the lateral side (AB) such that (DM) is perpendicular to (AB). It's also given that (MC = CD). We need to find the length of the upper base (BC) if (AD = d).Alright, let's visualize this trapezoid. Since it's a trapezoid, sides (AD) and (BC) are the two bases, with (AD) being the lower base and (BC) the upper base. Sides (AB) and (CD) are the non-parallel sides, or the legs of the trapezoid.Point (M) is somewhere on side (AB), and from (M), we draw a perpendicular to (AB), which meets (AB) at (M) and goes to point (D). So, (DM) is perpendicular to (AB). Also, it's given that (MC = CD). That seems important.I think drawing a diagram would help. Let me sketch trapezoid (ABCD) with (AD) as the longer base at the bottom, (BC) as the shorter base at the top, and legs (AB) and (CD). Point (M) is somewhere on (AB), and from (M), we draw (DM) perpendicular to (AB). Then, we have (MC = CD).Hmm, okay. Since (DM) is perpendicular to (AB), triangle (AMD) is a right triangle. Maybe I can use some properties of right triangles here. Also, (MC = CD) suggests that triangle (MCD) is isosceles with (MC = CD). So, maybe some properties of isosceles triangles can come into play.Let me label the diagram in my mind. Let me denote the coordinates to make it easier. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let's place point (A) at the origin ((0, 0)). Since (AD) is the lower base of length (d), point (D) would be at ((d, 0)). Now, since it's a trapezoid, sides (AB) and (CD) are the legs. Let me assume that the height of the trapezoid is (h). So, point (B) would be somewhere above (A), say at ((x, h)), and point (C) would be somewhere above (D), say at ((d - x, h)). This way, the upper base (BC) would have length (d - 2x), but I'm not sure yet.Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates more carefully. Let me fix the coordinate system. Let me set point (A) at ((0, 0)), point (D) at ((d, 0)). Then, since (AB) and (CD) are the legs, and (BC) is the upper base, points (B) and (C) must lie somewhere above (A) and (D) respectively, but at the same height because it's a trapezoid.Let me denote the coordinates as follows:- (A = (0, 0))- (D = (d, 0))- (B = (a, h))- (C = (b, h))Since (AB) is a leg, it goes from (A(0,0)) to (B(a, h)). Similarly, (CD) goes from (C(b, h)) to (D(d, 0)). The upper base (BC) goes from (B(a, h)) to (C(b, h)), so its length is (|b - a|). That's what we need to find.Given that (DM) is perpendicular to (AB), and (M) is on (AB). So, point (M) is somewhere along the line segment (AB), and (DM) is perpendicular to (AB). Let me find the coordinates of point (M).First, let's find the equation of line (AB). Since it goes from ((0,0)) to ((a, h)), the slope of (AB) is (m = frac{h}{a}). Therefore, the equation of line (AB) is (y = frac{h}{a}x).Now, the line (DM) is perpendicular to (AB), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of (m), which is (-frac{a}{h}). Since (DM) passes through point (D(d, 0)), the equation of line (DM) is (y - 0 = -frac{a}{h}(x - d)), which simplifies to (y = -frac{a}{h}x + frac{a d}{h}).Point (M) is the intersection of lines (AB) and (DM). So, let's set the two equations equal to each other:[frac{h}{a}x = -frac{a}{h}x + frac{a d}{h}]Multiply both sides by (a h) to eliminate denominators:[h^2 x = -a^2 x + a^2 d]Bring all terms to one side:[h^2 x + a^2 x = a^2 d][x(h^2 + a^2) = a^2 d][x = frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}]So, the x-coordinate of point (M) is (frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}). The y-coordinate can be found by plugging back into the equation of (AB):[y = frac{h}{a} cdot frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2} = frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}]Therefore, point (M) has coordinates (left( frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}, frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2} right)).Now, we are given that (MC = CD). Let's find the coordinates of point (C), which is ((b, h)), and point (D), which is ((d, 0)). So, vector (CD) is from (C(b, h)) to (D(d, 0)), which has length:[CD = sqrt{(d - b)^2 + (0 - h)^2} = sqrt{(d - b)^2 + h^2}]Similarly, vector (MC) is from (Mleft( frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}, frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2} right)) to (C(b, h)). So, the length (MC) is:[MC = sqrt{left(b - frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 + left(h - frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2}]Since (MC = CD), we can set these equal:[sqrt{left(b - frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 + left(h - frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2} = sqrt{(d - b)^2 + h^2}]Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:[left(b - frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 + left(h - frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 = (d - b)^2 + h^2]Let me simplify the left side:First, expand (left(b - frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2):[b^2 - 2b cdot frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2} + left(frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2]Next, expand (left(h - frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2):[h^2 - 2h cdot frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2} + left(frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2]So, adding these together:[b^2 - 2b cdot frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2} + left(frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 + h^2 - 2h cdot frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2} + left(frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2]Now, let's simplify term by term.First, (b^2 + h^2) remains.Next, the linear terms:[-2b cdot frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2} - 2h cdot frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}][= -2 cdot frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2} b - 2 cdot frac{a h^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}][= -2 cdot frac{a^2 d b + a h^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}][= -2a d cdot frac{a b + h^2}{h^2 + a^2}]Now, the squared terms:[left(frac{a^2 d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2 + left(frac{a h d}{h^2 + a^2}right)^2][= frac{a^4 d^2 + a^2 h^2 d^2}{(h^2 + a^2)^2}][= frac{a^2 d^2 (a^2 + h^2)}{(h^2 + a^2)^2}][= frac{a^2 d^2}{h^2 + a^2}]So, putting it all together, the left side becomes:[b^2 + h^2 - 2a d cdot frac{a b + h^2}{h^2 + a^2} + frac{a^2 d^2}{h^2 + a^2}]Now, the right side is:[(d - b)^2 + h^2 = d^2 - 2b d + b^2 + h^2]So, setting left side equal to right side:[b^2 + h^2 - 2a d cdot frac{a b + h^2}{h^2 + a^2} + frac{a^2 d^2}{h^2 + a^2} = d^2 - 2b d + b^2 + h^2]Subtract (b^2 + h^2) from both sides:[-2a d cdot frac{a b + h^2}{h^2 + a^2} + frac{a^2 d^2}{h^2 + a^2} = d^2 - 2b d]Let me factor out (frac{1}{h^2 + a^2}) on the left side:[frac{-2a d (a b + h^2) + a^2 d^2}{h^2 + a^2} = d^2 - 2b d]Multiply both sides by (h^2 + a^2):[-2a d (a b + h^2) + a^2 d^2 = (d^2 - 2b d)(h^2 + a^2)]Let me expand both sides.Left side:[-2a^2 b d - 2a d h^2 + a^2 d^2]Right side:[d^2 h^2 + d^2 a^2 - 2b d h^2 - 2b d a^2]So, writing both sides:Left: (-2a^2 b d - 2a d h^2 + a^2 d^2)Right: (d^2 h^2 + d^2 a^2 - 2b d h^2 - 2b d a^2)Let me bring all terms to the left side:[-2a^2 b d - 2a d h^2 + a^2 d^2 - d^2 h^2 - d^2 a^2 + 2b d h^2 + 2b d a^2 = 0]Simplify term by term:1. (-2a^2 b d + 2b d a^2 = 0) (they cancel out)2. (-2a d h^2 + 2b d h^2 = 2d h^2 (b - a))3. (a^2 d^2 - d^2 a^2 = 0) (they cancel out)4. (-d^2 h^2)So, combining the remaining terms:[2d h^2 (b - a) - d^2 h^2 = 0]Factor out (d h^2):[d h^2 [2(b - a) - d] = 0]Since (d) and (h) are lengths and can't be zero, we have:[2(b - a) - d = 0][2(b - a) = d][b - a = frac{d}{2}][b = a + frac{d}{2}]So, (b = a + frac{d}{2}). Recall that the upper base (BC) has length (|b - a|). Since (b = a + frac{d}{2}), the length (BC = b - a = frac{d}{2}).Wait, so the length of the upper base (BC) is (frac{d}{2}). That seems straightforward. Let me just verify if this makes sense.If (BC = frac{d}{2}), then the upper base is half the length of the lower base. That seems plausible in a trapezoid where such a point (M) exists with the given conditions. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem without coordinates, maybe using properties of trapezoids and triangles.Since (DM) is perpendicular to (AB), and (MC = CD), perhaps triangle (MCD) is isosceles with (MC = CD). So, angles opposite these sides are equal. Maybe we can use some angle relationships or similar triangles.Alternatively, considering the midpoint of (AD). Let me denote (N) as the midpoint of (AD), so (AN = ND = frac{d}{2}). Since (DM) is perpendicular to (AB), and (N) is the midpoint, maybe triangle (MND) is something special.Wait, in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. So, in triangle (AMD), which is a right triangle, the median from (M) to (AD) would be (MN), and it should be equal to (frac{AD}{2} = frac{d}{2}). So, (MN = frac{d}{2}).But since (MC = CD), maybe triangles (MCN) and (DCN) are congruent? Let me see.If (MC = CD), and (MN = CN = frac{d}{2}), then triangles (MCN) and (DCN) are congruent by SSS. Therefore, angles (MCN) and (DCN) are equal. Since (MC = CD), triangle (MCD) is isosceles, so the median from (C) to (MD) is also the altitude. Therefore, (CN) is perpendicular to (MD). But (DM) is already perpendicular to (AB), so (CN) is parallel to (AB). If (CN) is parallel to (AB), then quadrilateral (ABCN) is a parallelogram because both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, (AB = CN = frac{d}{2}). Hence, the upper base (BC) is equal to (AB), which is (frac{d}{2}).Wait, that seems a bit conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Wait, no, in the parallelogram (ABCN), (AB) is equal to (CN), which is (frac{d}{2}), and (BC) is equal to (AN), which is (frac{d}{2}). So, both (AB) and (BC) are (frac{d}{2}). But in a trapezoid, the two bases are (AD) and (BC). So, (AD = d), (BC = frac{d}{2}). That matches my earlier result.So, both methods lead me to the conclusion that (BC = frac{d}{2}). I think this makes sense. The key was realizing that (CN) is both a median and an altitude in triangle (MCD), making it parallel to (AB), thus forming a parallelogram and leading to the conclusion about the length of (BC).**Final Answer**The length of the upper base (BC) is boxed{dfrac{d}{2}}."},{"question":"Two friends plan to walk along a 36-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time.

Friend P is 25% faster than Friend Q. Let's assume Friend Q's speed is ( v ) km/h. Therefore, Friend P's speed is ( 1.25v ) km/h.Next, I'll calculate the combined speed of both friends as they walk towards each other. The combined speed is ( v + 1.25v = 2.25v ) km/h.To find the time it takes for them to meet, I'll divide the total distance of the trail by their combined speed: ( frac{36}{2.25v} ) hours.Finally, I'll calculate the distance Friend P walks by multiplying their speed by the time: ( 1.25v times frac{36}{2.25v} = 20 ) km."},{"question":"Given ( left| z_1 + z_2 right| = 4 cdot left| z_1 - z_2 right| = 3 ), with ( z_1, z_2 in mathbb{C} ). Find the range of ( left| z_1 right| ) and ( left| z_2 right| ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given two complex numbers, z₁ and z₂. The conditions are that the modulus of their sum is 4, and the modulus of their difference is 3. I need to find the range of the modulus of z₁ and z₂. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for complex numbers, the modulus represents their distance from the origin in the complex plane. So, |z₁ + z₂| = 4 means that the vector sum of z₁ and z₂ has a length of 4. Similarly, |z₁ - z₂| = 3 means the vector difference has a length of 3.I think I can use the properties of moduli and maybe some geometry here. Maybe if I consider z₁ and z₂ as vectors, I can form a parallelogram where the diagonals are |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂|. In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to twice the sum of the squares of the sides. Let me write that down:|z₁ + z₂|² + |z₁ - z₂|² = 2(|z₁|² + |z₂|²)Plugging in the given values:4² + 3² = 2(|z₁|² + |z₂|²)16 + 9 = 2(|z₁|² + |z₂|²)25 = 2(|z₁|² + |z₂|²)So, |z₁|² + |z₂|² = 25/2 = 12.5Okay, so the sum of the squares of their moduli is 12.5. But I need the range of |z₁| and |z₂| individually. How can I find that?I recall that for two non-negative numbers a and b, the maximum and minimum values of a and b given a + b = constant can be found using the AM-GM inequality or by considering the cases where one is as large as possible and the other as small as possible.But wait, in this case, it's the sum of squares, not the sum. So maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or think about it geometrically.Let me consider |z₁| and |z₂| as variables x and y. So, x² + y² = 12.5. I need to find the maximum and minimum possible values of x and y.But actually, the problem asks for the range of |z₁| and |z₂|, so I think it means the possible values each can take given the constraints. So, for |z₁|, what is the maximum it can be, and what is the minimum? Similarly for |z₂|.Let me think about the maximum of |z₁|. To maximize |z₁|, I need to minimize |z₂|. But how?From the equation x² + y² = 12.5, if I want to maximize x, I need to minimize y. The minimum value y can take is 0, but is that possible here?Wait, but we also have the conditions |z₁ + z₂| = 4 and |z₁ - z₂| = 3. If |z₂| were 0, then |z₁| would have to be both 4 and 3, which is impossible. So, y can't be 0.Hmm, so maybe I need another approach. Let me consider the triangle inequality and the reverse triangle inequality.We know that | |z₁| - |z₂| | ≤ |z₁ ± z₂| ≤ |z₁| + |z₂|.Given that |z₁ + z₂| = 4 and |z₁ - z₂| = 3, we can set up inequalities.First, for |z₁ + z₂| = 4:| |z₁| - |z₂| | ≤ 4 ≤ |z₁| + |z₂|Similarly, for |z₁ - z₂| = 3:| |z₁| - |z₂| | ≤ 3 ≤ |z₁| + |z₂|Wait, but 3 is less than 4, so the lower bound for |z₁| + |z₂| is 4, and the upper bound is... Hmm, not sure.Wait, actually, from |z₁ + z₂| = 4, we have:|z₁| + |z₂| ≥ 4And from |z₁ - z₂| = 3, we have:| |z₁| - |z₂| | ≤ 3So, combining these, we can say that:|z₁| + |z₂| ≥ 4and| |z₁| - |z₂| | ≤ 3Let me denote |z₁| = a and |z₂| = b. So, we have:a + b ≥ 4and|a - b| ≤ 3Also, from earlier, we have:a² + b² = 12.5So, now we have three equations:1. a + b ≥ 42. |a - b| ≤ 33. a² + b² = 12.5I need to find the possible values of a and b.Let me try to express a in terms of b or vice versa. From equation 3:a² + b² = 12.5I can write this as:(a + b)² - 2ab = 12.5But I don't know a + b or ab. Hmm.Alternatively, let me consider the system:a + b ≥ 4|a - b| ≤ 3a² + b² = 12.5Let me try to find the maximum and minimum values of a.To find the maximum value of a, we can consider that to maximize a, we need to minimize b, given the constraints.From |a - b| ≤ 3, we have:-3 ≤ a - b ≤ 3So, a - b ≤ 3 => b ≥ a - 3Also, a + b ≥ 4So, substituting b ≥ a - 3 into a + b ≥ 4:a + (a - 3) ≥ 42a - 3 ≥ 42a ≥ 7a ≥ 3.5So, the minimum value of a is 3.5. Wait, but we are trying to find the maximum value of a. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.Wait, perhaps I should use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider the geometry of the problem.Alternatively, let me consider that a and b are the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram with diagonals 4 and 3. In such a case, the sides can be found using the formula:a² + b² = (d₁² + d₂²)/2Which we already have: a² + b² = (16 + 9)/2 = 25/2 = 12.5So, that's consistent.Now, to find the range of a, we can consider that in a parallelogram, the length of each side must be less than the sum of the diagonals divided by 2 and greater than the difference of the diagonals divided by 2.Wait, is that correct?Actually, in a parallelogram, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of each diagonal. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, I remember that in a parallelogram, the length of each side must satisfy:|d₁/2 - d₂/2| ≤ a ≤ (d₁/2 + d₂/2)Similarly for b.So, substituting d₁ = 4 and d₂ = 3:|4/2 - 3/2| ≤ a ≤ (4/2 + 3/2)|2 - 1.5| ≤ a ≤ (2 + 1.5)0.5 ≤ a ≤ 3.5Wait, but earlier we had a ≥ 3.5 from the inequalities. That seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.The formula for the sides of a parallelogram in terms of the diagonals is:a = sqrt[(d₁² + d₂²)/4 + (2b² - 2c²)/4]Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formulas.Alternatively, perhaps I should use the triangle inequality on the diagonals.In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so each half-diagonal forms a triangle with the sides.So, considering half of the diagonals, which are 2 and 1.5, the sides a and b must satisfy:a + b > 2 + 1.5 = 3.5But we already have a + b ≥ 4, which is more restrictive.Also, |a - b| < 2 + 1.5 = 3.5But we have |a - b| ≤ 3, which is again more restrictive.So, perhaps the range of a is between (4 - 3)/2 and (4 + 3)/2?Wait, that might not be correct.Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that a and b are variables such that:a + b ≥ 4|a - b| ≤ 3a² + b² = 12.5I can try to express b in terms of a from the first inequality.From a + b ≥ 4 => b ≥ 4 - aFrom |a - b| ≤ 3 => -3 ≤ a - b ≤ 3 => b ≥ a - 3 and b ≤ a + 3So, combining these:b ≥ max(4 - a, a - 3)andb ≤ a + 3Now, since a² + b² = 12.5, let's substitute b from the inequalities.But this might get complicated. Maybe I can set up equations.Let me consider the case where b = 4 - a. Then, substituting into a² + b² = 12.5:a² + (4 - a)² = 12.5a² + 16 - 8a + a² = 12.52a² - 8a + 16 = 12.52a² - 8a + 3.5 = 0Multiply by 2 to eliminate the decimal:4a² - 16a + 7 = 0Using quadratic formula:a = [16 ± sqrt(256 - 112)] / 8= [16 ± sqrt(144)] / 8= [16 ± 12] / 8So, a = (16 + 12)/8 = 28/8 = 3.5 or a = (16 - 12)/8 = 4/8 = 0.5So, when b = 4 - a, we get a = 3.5 and b = 0.5, or a = 0.5 and b = 3.5.But wait, earlier we had |a - b| ≤ 3. Let's check:For a = 3.5 and b = 0.5, |3.5 - 0.5| = 3, which satisfies the inequality.Similarly, for a = 0.5 and b = 3.5, |0.5 - 3.5| = 3, which also satisfies.So, these are the boundary points.Now, what about the other case where b = a - 3?Substituting into a² + b² = 12.5:a² + (a - 3)² = 12.5a² + a² - 6a + 9 = 12.52a² - 6a + 9 = 12.52a² - 6a - 3.5 = 0Multiply by 2:4a² - 12a - 7 = 0Using quadratic formula:a = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 112)] / 8= [12 ± sqrt(256)] / 8= [12 ± 16] / 8So, a = (12 + 16)/8 = 28/8 = 3.5 or a = (12 - 16)/8 = (-4)/8 = -0.5But since a is a modulus, it can't be negative, so a = 3.5.Then, b = a - 3 = 0.5Which is the same as before.So, the only solutions are a = 3.5 and b = 0.5, or a = 0.5 and b = 3.5.Wait, but that seems to suggest that the only possible values are 3.5 and 0.5 for |z₁| and |z₂|. But the problem asks for the range, implying that there might be a continuous range of values.Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me think again.Perhaps the maximum and minimum values of |z₁| occur when |z₂| is minimized or maximized, but subject to the constraints.Wait, earlier I found that a² + b² = 12.5, and a + b ≥ 4, |a - b| ≤ 3.So, to find the range of a, we can consider the possible values given these constraints.Let me try to express b in terms of a.From a² + b² = 12.5 => b² = 12.5 - a²Also, from |a - b| ≤ 3 => -3 ≤ a - b ≤ 3 => b ≥ a - 3 and b ≤ a + 3So, combining with b² = 12.5 - a², we can write:(a - 3)² ≤ 12.5 - a² ≤ (a + 3)²Let me solve the left inequality first:(a - 3)² ≤ 12.5 - a²Expanding:a² - 6a + 9 ≤ 12.5 - a²Bring all terms to left:2a² - 6a + 9 - 12.5 ≤ 02a² - 6a - 3.5 ≤ 0Multiply by 2:4a² - 12a - 7 ≤ 0Solving 4a² - 12a - 7 = 0:a = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 112)] / 8 = [12 ± sqrt(256)] / 8 = [12 ± 16]/8So, a = (12 + 16)/8 = 28/8 = 3.5 or a = (12 - 16)/8 = -0.5Since a is positive, the inequality 4a² - 12a - 7 ≤ 0 holds between the roots, so for a between -0.5 and 3.5. But since a is positive, it's between 0 and 3.5.Now, solving the right inequality:12.5 - a² ≤ (a + 3)²Expanding:12.5 - a² ≤ a² + 6a + 9Bring all terms to left:12.5 - a² - a² - 6a - 9 ≤ 0-2a² - 6a + 3.5 ≤ 0Multiply by -1 (and reverse inequality):2a² + 6a - 3.5 ≥ 0Multiply by 2:4a² + 12a - 7 ≥ 0Solving 4a² + 12a - 7 = 0:a = [-12 ± sqrt(144 + 112)] / 8 = [-12 ± sqrt(256)] / 8 = [-12 ± 16]/8So, a = (-12 + 16)/8 = 4/8 = 0.5 or a = (-12 - 16)/8 = -28/8 = -3.5Since a is positive, the inequality 4a² + 12a - 7 ≥ 0 holds for a ≥ 0.5.So, combining both inequalities:From the left inequality: a ≤ 3.5From the right inequality: a ≥ 0.5Therefore, the range of a is [0.5, 3.5]Similarly, the range of b is also [0.5, 3.5]Wait, but earlier when I solved for specific cases, I only got a = 3.5 and b = 0.5 or vice versa. So, does that mean that the moduli can only take those specific values, or can they vary within the range?I think they can vary within the range because the problem states \\"find the range of |z₁| and |z₂|\\", implying that each can take any value within their respective ranges.But wait, let me verify. If a can be anywhere between 0.5 and 3.5, then b would adjust accordingly to satisfy a² + b² = 12.5.For example, if a = 1, then b² = 12.5 - 1 = 11.5 => b ≈ 3.391But does this satisfy the other constraints?Check |a - b| ≤ 3:|1 - 3.391| ≈ 2.391 ≤ 3, which is true.And a + b ≈ 1 + 3.391 ≈ 4.391 ≥ 4, which is also true.Similarly, if a = 2, then b² = 12.5 - 4 = 8.5 => b ≈ 2.915|2 - 2.915| ≈ 0.915 ≤ 3And a + b ≈ 4.915 ≥ 4So, it seems that a can indeed vary between 0.5 and 3.5, with b adjusting accordingly.Therefore, the range of |z₁| is [0.5, 3.5] and the same for |z₂|.But wait, the problem says \\"find the range of |z₁| and |z₂|\\". So, does that mean each individually has the range [0.5, 3.5], or is there a combined range?I think it means each individually can vary between 0.5 and 3.5.So, the range of |z₁| is [0.5, 3.5] and the range of |z₂| is also [0.5, 3.5].But let me double-check with another approach.Another way to think about this is using vectors. Let me represent z₁ and z₂ as vectors in the plane.Given |z₁ + z₂| = 4 and |z₁ - z₂| = 3.Let me denote z₁ as vector A and z₂ as vector B.Then, the diagonals of the parallelogram formed by A and B are 4 and 3.In such a case, the lengths of the sides (which are |A| and |B|) can be found using the formula:|A|² + |B|² = (|A + B|² + |A - B|²)/2Which we already used to get |A|² + |B|² = 12.5.Now, to find the range of |A|, we can consider that in a parallelogram, the length of each side must be between (|d₁| - |d₂|)/2 and (|d₁| + |d₂|)/2.Wait, is that correct?Actually, in a parallelogram, the length of each side must satisfy:| |d₁|/2 - |d₂|/2 | ≤ |A| ≤ (|d₁|/2 + |d₂|/2 )Similarly for |B|.So, substituting |d₁| = 4 and |d₂| = 3:|4/2 - 3/2| = |2 - 1.5| = 0.5 ≤ |A| ≤ (4/2 + 3/2) = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5So, |A| ∈ [0.5, 3.5]Similarly, |B| ∈ [0.5, 3.5]This confirms the earlier result.Therefore, the range of |z₁| is [0.5, 3.5] and the range of |z₂| is also [0.5, 3.5].So, in conclusion, both |z₁| and |z₂| can vary between 0.5 and 3.5."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, if the sum of the first four terms is 1, then the sum of the first eight terms is ( )A: 8B: 9C: 17D: 18","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence.

First, I should recall the formula for the sum of the first 'n' terms of an arithmetic sequence. I think it's something like S_n = n/2 times (2a + (n-1)d), where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'n' is the number of terms. Let me write that down:S_n = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d]Given that the common difference d is 1, I can plug that into the formula. So, for the first four terms, n = 4, and S_4 = 1. Let me set up the equation:1 = (4/2) * [2a + (4 - 1)*1]Simplifying that, 4/2 is 2, and (4 - 1)*1 is 3. So:1 = 2 * [2a + 3]Divide both sides by 2:1/2 = 2a + 3Now, subtract 3 from both sides:1/2 - 3 = 2aCalculating 1/2 - 3, which is -2.5 or -5/2:-5/2 = 2aDivide both sides by 2:a = (-5/2)/2 = -5/4So, the first term 'a' is -5/4. Now that I have the first term, I can find the sum of the first eight terms, S_8.Using the same formula:S_8 = (8/2) * [2a + (8 - 1)*1]Simplify 8/2 to 4, and (8 - 1)*1 is 7:S_8 = 4 * [2*(-5/4) + 7]Calculate inside the brackets first:2*(-5/4) = -10/4 = -5/2So, -5/2 + 7. Let me convert 7 to halves to add them easily: 7 = 14/2-5/2 + 14/2 = 9/2Now, multiply by 4:4 * (9/2) = (4/1)*(9/2) = (4*9)/(1*2) = 36/2 = 18So, the sum of the first eight terms is 18. Looking back at the options, D is 18. So, the answer should be D.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning:Sum of first four terms is 1, common difference is 1. I found the first term 'a' to be -5/4. Let me write out the first four terms:First term: -5/4Second term: -5/4 + 1 = -5/4 + 4/4 = -1/4Third term: -1/4 + 1 = -1/4 + 4/4 = 3/4Fourth term: 3/4 + 1 = 3/4 + 4/4 = 7/4Now, sum these up:-5/4 + (-1/4) + 3/4 + 7/4Combine the numerators:(-5 -1 + 3 +7)/4 = (4)/4 = 1Okay, that checks out. So, the sum of the first four terms is indeed 1. Now, let's find the sum of the first eight terms. I already have the formula result as 18, but let me list out the terms to confirm.First term: -5/4Second term: -1/4Third term: 3/4Fourth term: 7/4Fifth term: 7/4 + 1 = 11/4Sixth term: 11/4 + 1 = 15/4Seventh term: 15/4 + 1 = 19/4Eighth term: 19/4 + 1 = 23/4Now, sum all eight terms:-5/4 + (-1/4) + 3/4 + 7/4 + 11/4 + 15/4 + 19/4 + 23/4Combine the numerators:(-5 -1 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 15 + 19 + 23)/4Calculate the numerator step by step:-5 -1 = -6-6 + 3 = -3-3 + 7 = 44 + 11 = 1515 + 15 = 3030 + 19 = 4949 + 23 = 72So, total numerator is 72. Therefore, sum is 72/4 = 18.Yes, that confirms it. The sum of the first eight terms is indeed 18. So, the correct answer is D: 18."},{"question":"Mrs. Choi purchased a house for 80000.

They’re defined in terms of sine and cosine of some angle a, and there are logarithms involved. Hmm, let me try to parse this step by step.First, the problem states that 0 < b < 1 and 0 < a < π/4. So, b is a fraction between 0 and 1, and a is an angle in the first quadrant but less than 45 degrees. That means both sine and cosine of a are positive, and since a is less than π/4, cosine a should be greater than sine a. I remember that in the first quadrant, as the angle increases from 0 to π/2, sine increases and cosine decreases. So, yeah, for a < π/4, cos a > sin a.Now, looking at the definitions:x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a}y = (cos a)^{log₆ cos a}z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}I need to compare these three numbers and figure out their order. The options are given as (A) x < z < y, (B) y < z < x, (C) z < x < y, (D) x < y < z.Hmm, okay. So, I need to compare x, y, and z. Let me think about logarithms and exponents here. Since b is between 0 and 1, log base b is a decreasing function. That means if I have two numbers, say m and n, where m < n, then log_b m > log_b n. Because the logarithm function with base less than 1 decreases as the input increases.Given that, since 0 < a < π/4, we have 0 < sin a < cos a < 1. So, sin a is less than cos a, and both are less than 1. Therefore, log_b sin a and log_b cos a will both be positive because the logarithm of a number less than 1 with base less than 1 is positive. Also, since sin a < cos a, log_b sin a > log_b cos a.So, let me note that:log₆ sin a > log₆ cos a > 0Because log base 6 is actually a logarithm with base greater than 1, right? Wait, hold on. The problem says 0 < b < 1, but in the definitions, it's log base 6. Wait, is that a typo? Or is it log base b? Let me check.Wait, the original problem says:x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a}, y = (cos a)^{log₆ cos a}, z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}So, it's log base 6, not log base b. Hmm, that changes things. So, log base 6 is a logarithm with base greater than 1, so it's an increasing function. So, if m < n, then log₆ m < log₆ n.Given that, since 0 < sin a < cos a < 1, we have:log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a < 0Because log base 6 of a number less than 1 is negative. So, both log₆ sin a and log₆ cos a are negative, and since sin a < cos a, log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a.So, now, we have:log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a < 0So, both exponents are negative, and log₆ sin a is less than log₆ cos a.Now, let's look at x, y, z.x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a}y = (cos a)^{log₆ cos a}z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}So, x is sin a raised to the power of log₆ sin a, which is negative.Similarly, y is cos a raised to the power of log₆ cos a, which is also negative.z is sin a raised to the power of log₆ cos a, which is negative.So, all three are numbers less than 1 raised to negative exponents, which would make them greater than 1. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a number between 0 and 1 raised to a negative exponent, it's equivalent to 1 divided by that number raised to the positive exponent. So, for example, (1/2)^{-1} = 2.But in this case, the exponents are negative, so x, y, z are all greater than 1.Wait, but let me think again. Let me take an example. Suppose sin a = 1/2, log₆ (1/2) is negative, so (1/2)^{negative} is equal to 2^{positive}, which is greater than 1. Similarly, cos a is greater than sin a, say cos a = sqrt(3)/2, so log₆ (sqrt(3)/2) is also negative, so (sqrt(3)/2)^{negative} is greater than 1.So, all three x, y, z are greater than 1.Now, to compare x, y, z, which are all greater than 1, we need to figure out which is larger.Let me think about x and z first.x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a}z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}Since log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, and sin a is between 0 and 1, raising sin a to a higher negative exponent (since log₆ cos a is greater than log₆ sin a, but both are negative) would result in a smaller number.Wait, let's clarify.If I have a base between 0 and 1, say c, and two exponents p and q where p < q (both negative), then c^p > c^q because as the exponent increases (becomes less negative), the value decreases.Wait, let me test with numbers. Let c = 1/2, p = -2, q = -1.c^p = (1/2)^{-2} = 4c^q = (1/2)^{-1} = 2So, since p < q, c^p > c^q.So, in our case, since log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, and both are negative, then (sin a)^{log₆ sin a} > (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}, because the exponent log₆ sin a is less than log₆ cos a, so c^p > c^q.Therefore, x > z.Wait, but in the options, (A) is x < z < y, which would mean x < z, but according to this, x > z. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let's double-check.If c is between 0 and 1, and p < q (both negative), then c^p > c^q.So, since log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, and both are negative, then (sin a)^{log₆ sin a} > (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}, so x > z.So, x > z.Now, let's compare z and y.z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a}y = (cos a)^{log₆ cos a}So, both have the same exponent, log₆ cos a, which is negative.So, we can write z = (sin a)^k and y = (cos a)^k, where k = log₆ cos a < 0.Since sin a < cos a, and k is negative, then (sin a)^k > (cos a)^k.Because, again, if you have two numbers c < d < 1, and raise them to a negative exponent, the smaller base raised to that exponent is larger.For example, (1/4)^{-1} = 4, (1/2)^{-1} = 2, so 4 > 2.Similarly, (sin a)^k > (cos a)^k because sin a < cos a and k is negative.Therefore, z > y.Wait, but that would mean x > z > y, which would be x > z > y, but that's not one of the options. The options are:(A) x < z < y(B) y < z < x(C) z < x < y(D) x < y < zHmm, none of these match x > z > y. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me think again.Wait, when I compared x and z, I concluded x > z because log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, and since sin a is less than 1, raising it to a smaller exponent (more negative) gives a larger result.Similarly, when comparing z and y, since sin a < cos a, and both raised to the same negative exponent, z = (sin a)^k > (cos a)^k = y.So, x > z > y.But none of the options have x > z > y. The closest is (B) y < z < x, which is the same as x > z > y.Wait, (B) says y < z < x, which is equivalent to x > z > y. So, that would be the correct order.But wait, let me double-check.Wait, in the problem statement, it's log base 6, not log base b. So, log₆ is a logarithm with base greater than 1, so it's increasing. So, sin a < cos a implies log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, which are both negative.So, for x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a}, since log₆ sin a is negative, it's equivalent to 1 / (sin a)^{|log₆ sin a|}.Similarly, z = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a} = 1 / (sin a)^{|log₆ cos a|}.Since log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a, |log₆ sin a| > |log₆ cos a|.Therefore, (sin a)^{|log₆ sin a|} > (sin a)^{|log₆ cos a|}, so 1 / (sin a)^{|log₆ sin a|} < 1 / (sin a)^{|log₆ cos a|}, which means x < z.Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, maybe I confused the direction.Wait, let's think carefully.If I have two exponents, p and q, where p < q (both negative), and a base c between 0 and 1.Then, c^p > c^q because as the exponent increases (becomes less negative), the value decreases.So, if p < q, then c^p > c^q.In our case, for x and z:x = (sin a)^{log₆ sin a} = c^pz = (sin a)^{log₆ cos a} = c^qwhere c = sin a < 1, p = log₆ sin a, q = log₆ cos a, and p < q (since log₆ sin a < log₆ cos a).Therefore, c^p > c^q, so x > z.Wait, but earlier, when I thought about it in terms of 1 / c^{|p|}, I concluded x < z. Which is correct?Wait, let's take an example.Let’s say sin a = 1/4, cos a = 1/2, just for simplicity (even though in reality, sin a and cos a can't be 1/4 and 1/2 for the same a, but just for the sake of example).Then, log₆ (1/4) = log₆ 4^{-1} = - log₆ 4 ≈ -0.7737Similarly, log₆ (1/2) = - log₆ 2 ≈ -0.3869So, p = -0.7737, q = -0.3869Then, x = (1/4)^{-0.7737} = 4^{0.7737} ≈ 4^{0.7737} ≈ e^{0.7737 * ln 4} ≈ e^{0.7737 * 1.3863} ≈ e^{1.075} ≈ 2.93z = (1/4)^{-0.3869} = 4^{0.3869} ≈ e^{0.3869 * ln 4} ≈ e^{0.3869 * 1.3863} ≈ e^{0.536} ≈ 1.71So, x ≈ 2.93, z ≈ 1.71, so x > z.Similarly, y = (1/2)^{-0.3869} = 2^{0.3869} ≈ e^{0.3869 * ln 2} ≈ e^{0.3869 * 0.6931} ≈ e^{0.268} ≈ 1.307So, y ≈ 1.307, z ≈ 1.71, x ≈ 2.93Therefore, y < z < x, which is option (B).Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought x > z > y, which would be x > z > y, but in this example, it's y < z < x, which is the same as x > z > y.Wait, but in the example, x > z > y, which is the same as y < z < x, which is option (B). So, that seems correct.But earlier, when I thought about x and z, I concluded x > z, which is correct, and z > y, which is also correct, so overall x > z > y, which is y < z < x.So, the correct order is y < z < x, which is option (B).Wait, but in my first reasoning, I thought x > z > y, which is the same as y < z < x, so that's consistent.But earlier, I was confused because I thought the options didn't have x > z > y, but actually, option (B) is y < z < x, which is the same as x > z > y.So, the correct answer should be (B).But wait, let me double-check with another example to make sure.Let’s take a = π/6, so sin a = 1/2, cos a = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.Compute log₆ sin a = log₆ (1/2) ≈ -0.3869log₆ cos a = log₆ (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ log₆ (0.866) ≈ -0.129So, p = -0.3869, q = -0.129Then,x = (1/2)^{-0.3869} = 2^{0.3869} ≈ 1.307z = (1/2)^{-0.129} = 2^{0.129} ≈ 1.096y = (sqrt(3)/2)^{-0.129} ≈ (0.866)^{-0.129} ≈ e^{-0.129 * ln(0.866)} ≈ e^{-0.129 * (-0.1447)} ≈ e^{0.0187} ≈ 1.019So, y ≈ 1.019, z ≈ 1.096, x ≈ 1.307So, y < z < x, which is again option (B).Therefore, the correct answer is (B).But wait, in the first example, I had sin a = 1/4, cos a = 1/2, which isn't possible because sin^2 a + cos^2 a must equal 1. So, that was a mistake. Let me correct that.Let me choose a = π/6, sin a = 1/2, cos a = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is valid.As above, x ≈ 1.307, z ≈ 1.096, y ≈ 1.019So, y < z < x.Another example: a = π/12, sin a ≈ 0.2588, cos a ≈ 0.9659Compute log₆ sin a ≈ log₆ 0.2588 ≈ -1.0log₆ cos a ≈ log₆ 0.9659 ≈ -0.05So, p = -1.0, q = -0.05x = (0.2588)^{-1.0} ≈ 3.863z = (0.2588)^{-0.05} ≈ e^{-0.05 * ln(0.2588)} ≈ e^{-0.05 * (-1.352)} ≈ e^{0.0676} ≈ 1.070y = (0.9659)^{-0.05} ≈ e^{-0.05 * ln(0.9659)} ≈ e^{-0.05 * (-0.0347)} ≈ e^{0.0017} ≈ 1.0017So, y ≈ 1.0017, z ≈ 1.070, x ≈ 3.863Again, y < z < x.Therefore, it seems consistent that y < z < x, which is option (B).So, the correct answer is (B)."},{"question":"Amanda, Ben, Carlos, and David share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7:3, respectively. If Amanda's portion is 20, what is the total amount of money shared?","answer":"First, I need to understand the ratio of the portions that Amanda, Ben, Carlos, and David are sharing. The ratio is given as 1:2:7:3, which means Amanda's portion is 1 part, Ben's is 2 parts, Carlos's is 7 parts, and David's is 3 parts.Next, I know that Amanda's portion is 20. Since Amanda's portion corresponds to 1 part of the ratio, I can determine the value of one part by dividing Amanda's amount by her ratio number:[text{Value of one part} = frac{20}{1} = 20]Now, I can calculate each person's share based on the number of parts they receive:- **Ben's share**: (2 times 20 = 40)- **Carlos's share**: (7 times 20 = 140)- **David's share**: (3 times 20 = 60)Finally, to find the total amount of money shared, I add up all the individual shares:[20 + 40 + 140 + 60 = 260]"},{"question":"The inverse of the universal proposition \\"For any x in mathbb{Z}, 2x+1 is an integer\\" is (　　)A: If 2x+1 is an integer, then x in mathbb{Z}B: If 2x+1 is odd, then x in mathbb{Z}C: If 2x+1 is even, then x in mathbb{Z}D: If 2x+1 is divisible by 3, then x in mathbb{Z}","answer":"Alright, so I have this question about the inverse of a universal proposition. The proposition given is: \\"For any ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer.\\" And I need to find its inverse from the options A to D.First, I need to recall what an inverse of a proposition is. From what I remember, the inverse of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement. So, if the original statement is \\"If P, then Q,\\" the inverse would be \\"If not P, then not Q.\\"But wait, the given proposition isn't in the \\"If P, then Q\\" form. It's a universal statement: \\"For any ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer.\\" So, how do I find its inverse?Maybe I should first rephrase the universal proposition into an implication. The universal statement can be interpreted as: \\"If ( x ) is an integer, then ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer.\\" So, in logical terms, that's ( P rightarrow Q ), where ( P ) is \\"( x in mathbb{Z} )\\" and ( Q ) is \\"( 2x + 1 ) is an integer.\\"Now, the inverse of ( P rightarrow Q ) is ( neg P rightarrow neg Q ). So, applying that, the inverse should be: \\"If ( x ) is not an integer, then ( 2x + 1 ) is not an integer.\\" Hmm, but none of the options directly state that. Let me look at the options again.Option A: If ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer, then ( x in mathbb{Z} ).Option B: If ( 2x + 1 ) is odd, then ( x in mathbb{Z} ).Option C: If ( 2x + 1 ) is even, then ( x in mathbb{Z} ).Option D: If ( 2x + 1 ) is divisible by 3, then ( x in mathbb{Z} ).Wait a second, none of these options directly state the inverse I thought of, which was about ( x ) not being an integer implying ( 2x + 1 ) isn't an integer. Instead, all the options are in the form of \\"If something about ( 2x + 1 ), then ( x in mathbb{Z} ).\\"Is there a different way to interpret the inverse? Maybe I confused the inverse with the contrapositive. Let me recall: the contrapositive of ( P rightarrow Q ) is ( neg Q rightarrow neg P ), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. But the inverse is ( neg P rightarrow neg Q ), which isn't necessarily equivalent.But in this case, maybe the question is referring to the converse or something else? Wait, the question specifically says \\"the inverse of the universal proposition.\\" So, the inverse would involve negating both the hypothesis and conclusion.But the original proposition is a universal statement, so its inverse should also be a universal statement. However, the options are all conditional statements. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, perhaps the inverse is formed by swapping the hypothesis and conclusion, but that would be the converse, not the inverse. The inverse is about negating both.Wait, perhaps the question is using \\"inverse\\" in a different sense. Maybe they mean the contrapositive? Because the contrapositive is often confused with the inverse.But let me think again. The original statement is: For all ( x in mathbb{Z} ), ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer. So, in logical terms, it's ( forall x (P(x) rightarrow Q(x)) ), where ( P(x) ) is ( x in mathbb{Z} ) and ( Q(x) ) is ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer.The inverse of this would be ( forall x (neg P(x) rightarrow neg Q(x)) ), which is \\"For all ( x ), if ( x ) is not an integer, then ( 2x + 1 ) is not an integer.\\"But again, the options are not stating this. They are stating implications where the conclusion is ( x in mathbb{Z} ). So, perhaps the question is asking for the contrapositive?Wait, the contrapositive of the original statement would be ( forall x (neg Q(x) rightarrow neg P(x)) ), which is \\"For all ( x ), if ( 2x + 1 ) is not an integer, then ( x ) is not an integer.\\" But that's still not matching the options.Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the converse of the original statement? The converse would be ( forall x (Q(x) rightarrow P(x)) ), which is \\"For all ( x ), if ( 2x + 1 ) is an integer, then ( x ) is an integer.\\" That is exactly option A.But wait, the question says \\"the inverse,\\" not the converse. So, I'm confused now. Maybe in some contexts, \\"inverse\\" is used to mean the converse? Or perhaps the question is using \\"inverse\\" incorrectly.Alternatively, maybe the inverse is formed by negating the entire statement. The original is ( forall x (P(x) rightarrow Q(x)) ). The inverse would be ( forall x (neg P(x) rightarrow neg Q(x)) ), which is not directly an option.But looking at the options, option A is the converse, not the inverse. So, perhaps the question is incorrectly using \\"inverse\\" when it should be \\"converse.\\" Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the term.Wait, let me check the definitions again. In logic, the inverse of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion. So, for ( P rightarrow Q ), the inverse is ( neg P rightarrow neg Q ). The contrapositive is ( neg Q rightarrow neg P ), and the converse is ( Q rightarrow P ).So, in this case, the original statement is ( forall x (P(x) rightarrow Q(x)) ). The inverse would be ( forall x (neg P(x) rightarrow neg Q(x)) ). But none of the options state this. Instead, the options are about ( Q(x) rightarrow P(x) ), which is the converse.Therefore, perhaps the question is incorrectly asking for the converse instead of the inverse. Or maybe in some contexts, \\"inverse\\" is used differently.Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the inverse in terms of the universal statement. The inverse of a universal statement is an existential statement. Wait, no, that's not right. The inverse of a universal statement would still be universal if we negate both parts.Wait, perhaps the question is not about the inverse of the implication but the inverse of the universal statement. The original statement is universal: for all x, P(x) implies Q(x). The inverse would be for all x, not P(x) implies not Q(x). But again, that's not an option.Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the inverse in terms of the converse. But that's not standard terminology.Wait, looking back at the options, option A is the converse of the original statement. The original is P implies Q, converse is Q implies P. So, if the question is asking for the inverse, which is not the same as the converse, but in this case, the inverse isn't among the options. So, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding.Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the inverse in terms of the statement's truth. The original statement is always true because if x is an integer, 2x +1 is also an integer. So, the inverse would be: if x is not an integer, then 2x +1 is not an integer. But again, that's not an option.Wait, but looking at the options, option A is: If 2x +1 is an integer, then x is an integer. Which is the converse. So, perhaps the question is asking for the converse, but mistakenly calling it the inverse.Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, the inverse is considered as the statement where you swap the hypothesis and conclusion and negate both. But that would be the contrapositive, which is equivalent to the original statement.Wait, no. The contrapositive is swapping and negating, which is equivalent. The inverse is just negating both without swapping.So, in this case, the inverse would be: If x is not an integer, then 2x +1 is not an integer. Which is not among the options.But the options are all about 2x +1 having some property implying x is an integer.Wait, perhaps the question is considering the inverse as the statement where you negate the conclusion and the hypothesis. So, original: For all x, if x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer. Inverse: For all x, if 2x +1 is not integer, then x is not integer. Which is the contrapositive, but that's equivalent to the original.But again, the options are about 2x +1 being integer, odd, even, or divisible by 3, implying x is integer.Wait, maybe the question is considering the inverse as the converse, which is option A. But that's not standard.Alternatively, perhaps the question is using \\"inverse\\" to mean the opposite in some other way.Wait, let's think about what each option is saying.Option A: If 2x +1 is an integer, then x is an integer.Is this true? Well, if 2x +1 is an integer, does that mean x is an integer? Let's see. Suppose 2x +1 is an integer. Then, 2x is an integer minus 1, which is still an integer. So, 2x is an integer, which implies x is a half-integer, like 0.5, 1.5, etc. So, x doesn't have to be an integer. For example, x = 0.5, then 2x +1 = 2, which is an integer, but x is not an integer. So, option A is not necessarily true.Option B: If 2x +1 is odd, then x is an integer.Is this true? Well, 2x +1 is odd. Let's see. If x is an integer, then 2x is even, so 2x +1 is odd. But if 2x +1 is odd, does that mean x is an integer? Let's see. Suppose x is 0.5, then 2x +1 = 2, which is even, not odd. If x is 1.5, 2x +1 = 4, which is even. Wait, actually, if x is not an integer, say x = k + 0.5 where k is integer, then 2x +1 = 2k +1 +1 = 2k +2, which is even. So, if 2x +1 is odd, then x must be an integer. Because if x were not an integer, 2x +1 would be even. So, option B is true.Option C: If 2x +1 is even, then x is an integer.Is this true? If 2x +1 is even, then 2x is odd, which implies x is a half-integer, like 0.5, 1.5, etc. So, x is not an integer. Therefore, if 2x +1 is even, x is not an integer. So, the statement \\"If 2x +1 is even, then x is an integer\\" is false.Option D: If 2x +1 is divisible by 3, then x is an integer.Is this true? Let's see. Suppose 2x +1 is divisible by 3. Does that imply x is an integer? Let's take x = 1, which is integer, 2x +1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. x = 2, 2x +1 = 5, not divisible by 3. x = 1.5, 2x +1 = 4, not divisible by 3. x = 0.5, 2x +1 = 2, not divisible by 3. x = 2.5, 2x +1 = 6, which is divisible by 3. But x = 2.5 is not an integer. So, 2x +1 = 6 is divisible by 3, but x is not an integer. Therefore, option D is false.So, from the options, only option B is true. But wait, the question is asking for the inverse of the original proposition, not which statement is true.But earlier, I thought the inverse would be \\"If x is not an integer, then 2x +1 is not an integer,\\" which is not an option. However, option B is \\"If 2x +1 is odd, then x is an integer,\\" which is actually the contrapositive of the inverse.Wait, let me clarify. The original statement is: For all x, if x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer. The inverse would be: For all x, if x is not integer, then 2x +1 is not integer. The contrapositive of the inverse would be: For all x, if 2x +1 is integer, then x is integer, which is option A. But we saw that option A is not necessarily true because x could be a half-integer.Wait, but earlier, I thought option B was true. Let me re-examine that.Option B: If 2x +1 is odd, then x is an integer.We saw that if x is not an integer, then 2x +1 is even. Therefore, if 2x +1 is odd, x must be an integer. So, option B is true.But how does that relate to the inverse? The inverse of the original statement is \\"If x is not integer, then 2x +1 is not integer.\\" The contrapositive of this inverse would be \\"If 2x +1 is integer, then x is integer,\\" which is option A. But option A is not necessarily true, as x could be a half-integer.However, option B is a different statement. It's saying that if 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. This is actually a stronger statement than the original. Because the original only says that if x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer (and specifically odd, since 2x is even, plus 1 is odd). So, the original statement is that x integer implies 2x +1 is odd integer.Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: If 2x +1 is not odd, then x is not integer. But that's not an option.Wait, no. The original statement is: For all x, if x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer (and specifically odd). So, the contrapositive is: For all x, if 2x +1 is not integer, then x is not integer. But again, that's not an option.But option B is: If 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. Which is actually the converse of the original statement's conclusion. Because the original statement is x integer implies 2x +1 is odd integer. The converse would be 2x +1 is odd integer implies x is integer, which is option B.So, perhaps the question is asking for the converse, but it's mislabeled as the inverse.Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the inverse in a different way. Let me think again.The original statement is a universal implication: For all x, P(x) → Q(x), where P(x) is x ∈ ℤ and Q(x) is 2x +1 is integer.The inverse of this statement would be For all x, ¬P(x) → ¬Q(x). So, \\"For all x, if x is not integer, then 2x +1 is not integer.\\" But this is not an option.However, the contrapositive of the original statement is For all x, ¬Q(x) → ¬P(x), which is \\"For all x, if 2x +1 is not integer, then x is not integer.\\" Again, not an option.But option A is the converse: For all x, Q(x) → P(x), which is \\"If 2x +1 is integer, then x is integer.\\" We saw that this is not necessarily true because x could be a half-integer.Option B is: If 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. Which is actually a different statement. It's not the inverse, but it's a related statement.Wait, maybe the question is considering the inverse in terms of the property of 2x +1. The original statement is about 2x +1 being integer when x is integer. The inverse could be about 2x +1 not being integer when x is not integer. But that's the inverse, which is not an option.Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the inverse as the statement where the conclusion is negated. So, original: For all x, if x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer. Inverse: For all x, if x is integer, then 2x +1 is not integer. But that's not an option either.Wait, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually asking for the converse, which is option A. But the user initially thought the answer was A, but upon re-examining, I think option B is actually true.Wait, let me clarify:Original statement: For all x ∈ ℤ, 2x +1 is integer. Which is always true because 2x is integer, so 2x +1 is integer.Inverse: For all x ∉ ℤ, 2x +1 ∉ ℤ. Is this true? Let's see. If x is not integer, say x = 0.5, then 2x +1 = 2, which is integer. So, the inverse is false.But the question is asking for the inverse of the proposition, not whether it's true or false.But the options are all conditional statements. So, perhaps the question is not about the inverse of the universal statement, but the inverse of the implication within the universal statement.The original implication is P → Q: If x is integer, then 2x +1 is integer.The inverse of this implication is ¬P → ¬Q: If x is not integer, then 2x +1 is not integer.But again, this is not an option.However, the contrapositive of the original implication is ¬Q → ¬P: If 2x +1 is not integer, then x is not integer. Also not an option.But option A is Q → P: If 2x +1 is integer, then x is integer. Which is the converse.Option B is: If 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. Which is a different statement.Wait, perhaps the question is considering the inverse in terms of the parity. The original statement is that 2x +1 is integer, which is always odd when x is integer. So, maybe the inverse is considering the parity.But I'm getting confused now. Let me try to approach it differently.The original statement is: For any x ∈ ℤ, 2x +1 is an integer. So, it's saying that for all integers x, 2x +1 is integer. Which is trivially true because 2x is integer, so 2x +1 is integer.The inverse of this statement would be: For any x ∉ ℤ, 2x +1 ∉ ℤ. But as we saw, this is false because x can be a half-integer, making 2x +1 integer.But the question is giving options that are conditional statements, not universal statements. So, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually asking for the converse or something else.Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the inverse in terms of the statement's logical form. The original is a universal statement, so its inverse would be another universal statement. But the options are conditional, so perhaps the question is asking for the inverse implication.Wait, the original implication is P → Q. The inverse is ¬P → ¬Q. So, in terms of the universal statement, it's For all x, ¬P(x) → ¬Q(x). But the options are not stating this.Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the inverse as the statement where the conclusion is negated. So, original: For all x, P(x) → Q(x). Inverse: For all x, P(x) → ¬Q(x). But that's not the case.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way.The original statement is: For any x in integers, 2x +1 is integer. So, it's a statement about the image of integers under the function f(x) = 2x +1.The inverse could be about the preimage. So, if 2x +1 is integer, then x is integer. Which is option A. But as we saw, this is not necessarily true because x could be a half-integer.But the question is asking for the inverse, not whether it's true. So, perhaps the inverse is indeed option A, even though it's not necessarily true.Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the inverse in terms of the function's properties. The function f(x) = 2x +1 is invertible over integers because it's bijective. So, the inverse function would be f^{-1}(y) = (y -1)/2. So, if y is odd, then (y -1)/2 is integer. Therefore, if 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. Which is option B.Wait, that makes sense. So, if we consider the function f(x) = 2x +1, which maps integers to odd integers. The inverse function would map odd integers back to integers. Therefore, if 2x +1 is odd, then x must be integer. So, option B is the inverse in terms of the function's invertibility.Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option B.But earlier, I thought the inverse was about negating both parts, but in this context, considering the function's inverse makes more sense.So, to summarize:Original statement: For all x ∈ ℤ, 2x +1 is integer (and specifically odd).Inverse function: If 2x +1 is odd, then x ∈ ℤ.Therefore, the inverse is option B.But I'm still a bit confused because the term \\"inverse\\" can have different meanings. In logic, the inverse of P → Q is ¬P → ¬Q, but in functions, the inverse is about reversing the mapping.Given that the options are about the function's output implying something about x, it's more likely that the question is referring to the function's inverse, making option B the correct answer.However, initially, I thought the inverse was option A, but upon considering the function's properties, option B makes more sense.Wait, but the original statement is not just about mapping integers to integers, but specifically to odd integers. So, the function f(x) = 2x +1 maps integers to odd integers. Therefore, the inverse function would map odd integers back to integers. So, if 2x +1 is odd, then x is integer. That's option B.Therefore, the correct answer is option B.But I'm still a bit torn because in logic, the inverse is ¬P → ¬Q, which is not an option. But in the context of functions, the inverse is about reversing the mapping, which leads to option B.Given that the question is about the inverse of the universal proposition, and considering the function's inverse, I think option B is the intended answer.But wait, let me double-check. If I take the original statement: For all x ∈ ℤ, 2x +1 is integer. The inverse in terms of the function would be: For all y ∈ (2ℤ +1), y = 2x +1 implies x ∈ ℤ. Which is exactly option B.Therefore, the correct answer is option B."},{"question":"In 2005, the average monthly rainfall in Rainville was 50text{ mm}.

If the length of the base is tripled, the width is halved, and the height is increased by 25%, what is the new volume of the pyramid, in cubic inches?","answer":"First, I recognize that the volume of a pyramid is calculated using the formula ( V = frac{1}{3} times text{length} times text{width} times text{height} ).Given that the original volume is 60 cubic inches, I need to determine how changes in the dimensions affect the volume.1. **Tripling the Length**: Increasing the length by a factor of 3 will multiply the volume by 3.2. **Halving the Width**: Reducing the width by half will multiply the volume by 0.5.3. **Increasing the Height by 25%**: Raising the height by 25% means the new height is 1.25 times the original, which will multiply the volume by 1.25.To find the new volume, I apply these scaling factors to the original volume:[ V' = 60 times 3 times 0.5 times 1.25 ]Calculating this gives:[ V' = 60 times 1.875 = 112.5 ]Therefore, the new volume of the pyramid is 112.5 cubic inches."},{"question":"Find the number of counter examples to the statement:textbf{(A)} 0 qquadtextbf{(B)} 1 qquadtextbf{(C)} 2 qquadtextbf{(D)} 3 qquadtextbf{(E)} 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of counterexamples to a statement. The statement isn't explicitly given, but based on the context, it seems like it's about numbers with certain properties. The options are from A to E, with numbers 0 to 4. I need to figure out how many counterexamples there are.First, I need to understand what a counterexample is. A counterexample is an example that contradicts a statement. So, if the statement is something like \\"All numbers with a certain property are prime,\\" a counterexample would be a number that has that property but isn't prime.Looking at the problem, it mentions numbers where the sum of their digits is 4, and none of the digits are zero. So, the statement might be: \\"If a number has digits that sum to 4 and none of its digits are zero, then the number is prime.\\" If that's the case, I need to find numbers that meet the criteria (sum of digits is 4, no zero digits) but are not prime. Each such number would be a counterexample.Alright, let's list all possible numbers that fit the criteria. The sum of the digits is 4, and no digit is zero. So, the digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but they can't be 0. Also, the number can have multiple digits, so we need to consider all combinations.First, single-digit numbers: the only single-digit number that sums to 4 is 4 itself. So, 4 is a candidate. Is 4 prime? No, because 4 is divisible by 2. So, 4 is a counterexample.Next, two-digit numbers: the digits can be combinations of numbers that add up to 4. Let's list them:- 1 and 3: So, the numbers are 13 and 31.- 2 and 2: The number is 22.- 4 and 0: But we can't have 0, so this is out.Now, check if these numbers are prime:- 13: Yes, 13 is a prime number.- 31: Yes, 31 is a prime number.- 22: No, 22 is not prime because it's divisible by 2 and 11.So, 22 is another counterexample.Moving on to three-digit numbers: the digits must add up to 4, no zeros. Possible combinations:- 1, 1, 2: The numbers are 112, 121, and 211.- 1, 3, 0: But we can't have 0, so this is out.- 2, 2, 0: Again, 0 is not allowed.- 4, 0, 0: Not allowed.So, the valid three-digit numbers are 112, 121, and 211.Check if these are prime:- 112: Even number, divisible by 2, so not prime.- 121: Let's see, 121 divided by 11 is 11, so 121 is 11 squared, not prime.- 211: Let's check for divisibility. It's not even, doesn't end with 5, so not divisible by 2 or 5. Let's try dividing by 3: 2+1+1=4, which isn't divisible by 3. Next, 7: 211 divided by 7 is about 30.14, not an integer. 11: 211 divided by 11 is about 19.18, not an integer. 13: 211 divided by 13 is about 16.23, not an integer. Since the square root of 211 is around 14.5, we only need to check primes up to 13. So, 211 is prime.So, among the three-digit numbers, 112 and 121 are not prime, making them counterexamples.Now, four-digit numbers: digits sum to 4, no zeros. The only combination is four 1s: 1111.Check if 1111 is prime. Let's see, 1111 divided by 11 is 101, so 1111 is 11 times 101, which means it's not prime. So, 1111 is another counterexample.Are there any other four-digit numbers? Let's see, could we have other combinations? For example, 1, 1, 1, 1 is the only way to get four digits summing to 4 without zeros. So, 1111 is the only four-digit number here.What about five-digit numbers? The digits would have to sum to 4, with no zeros. The only way is five 1s: 11111. Let's check if that's prime.11111 divided by 41 is 271, so 11111 is 41 times 271, which means it's not prime. So, 11111 is another counterexample.Wait, but the problem didn't specify the number of digits, just that the sum of digits is 4 and no digits are zero. So, theoretically, there could be numbers with more digits, but each additional digit would have to be 1, since we can't have zeros. So, 111111, 1111111, etc., all the way up. Each of these would be numbers like 111...1 with n digits, where n is greater than or equal to 4.But are these numbers prime? Let's check a few:- 111111: Divisible by 3 because the sum of digits is 6, which is divisible by 3. So, not prime.- 1111111: Let's see, sum of digits is 7, not divisible by 3. Let's try dividing by small primes. Divided by 7: 1111111 / 7 is approximately 158730.14, not an integer. Divided by 11: 1111111 / 11 is 101010.09, not an integer. Divided by 13: 1111111 / 13 is approximately 85470.08, not an integer. It might be prime, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, 1111111 is known to be prime? Or is it composite? Let me think. I recall that repunit primes (numbers consisting of all 1s) are rare. The repunit with 2 digits is 11, which is prime. With 3 digits, 111 is 37 times 3, not prime. With 4 digits, 1111 is 11 times 101, not prime. With 5 digits, 11111 is 41 times 271, not prime. With 6 digits, 111111 is divisible by 3. With 7 digits, 1111111: I think this might actually be prime. Let me check.Actually, 1111111 is 239 times 4649, so it's not prime. So, 1111111 is composite.So, in general, numbers like 111...1 with more than one digit are rarely prime. So, each of these would be counterexamples.But wait, the problem is asking for the number of counterexamples. How many are there? If we consider all numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, regardless of the number of digits, there are infinitely many such numbers, each with more 1s. But the answer choices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, probably, the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, as in the initial analysis.In the initial analysis, we found the following counterexamples:- 4 (single-digit)- 22 (two-digit)- 112, 121 (three-digit)- 1111 (four-digit)That's a total of 5 counterexamples. But the answer choices only go up to 4. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.Wait, let's go back. The problem might be specifically about numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, but perhaps it's considering numbers with up to four digits, as in the initial problem statement. Let's recount:Single-digit: 4 (not prime) - 1 counterexample.Two-digit: 22 (not prime) - 1 counterexample.Three-digit: 112 (not prime), 121 (not prime) - 2 counterexamples.Four-digit: 1111 (not prime) - 1 counterexample.So, total counterexamples: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.But the answer choices are only up to 4. Maybe the problem is considering only numbers with up to four digits, but the answer choices don't include 5. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcounting.Wait, maybe the problem is about numbers with exactly four digits, not up to four digits. Let me re-read the problem.The problem says: \\"Find the number of counter examples to the statement: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\\"But it doesn't specify the statement. However, based on the initial context, it's about numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros being prime. So, the statement is likely: \\"If a number has digits that sum to 4 and none of its digits are zero, then the number is prime.\\" Therefore, counterexamples are numbers that satisfy the condition (digits sum to 4, no zeros) but are not prime.So, considering all such numbers, regardless of the number of digits, there are infinitely many counterexamples, but the answer choices are finite. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits.In that case, as I listed before:Single-digit: 4 - 1 counterexample.Two-digit: 22 - 1 counterexample.Three-digit: 112, 121 - 2 counterexamples.Four-digit: 1111 - 1 counterexample.Total: 5 counterexamples. But the answer choices are only up to 4. Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is considering only numbers with exactly four digits. Let me check.If the problem is about four-digit numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, then the only such number is 1111, which is not prime. So, only 1 counterexample. But that would make the answer B) 1.But that seems inconsistent with the initial analysis where I considered numbers with different digit lengths.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about numbers where the sum of digits is 4, and none of the digits are zero, and the number itself is prime. So, the statement is: \\"If a number has digits summing to 4 and no digits are zero, then it is prime.\\" Therefore, counterexamples are numbers that meet the condition but are not prime.In that case, as I listed, there are multiple counterexamples: 4, 22, 112, 121, 1111, etc. But since the answer choices are up to 4, perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers. Let's see.If we exclude single-digit numbers, then:Two-digit: 22 - 1 counterexample.Three-digit: 112, 121 - 2 counterexamples.Four-digit: 1111 - 1 counterexample.Total: 4 counterexamples. That would make the answer E) 4.But I'm not sure if the problem excludes single-digit numbers. The initial problem didn't specify, so it's ambiguous.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about four-digit numbers specifically, in which case only 1111 is a counterexample, making the answer B) 1.But given the answer choices and the initial analysis, I think the intended answer is 2 counterexamples, considering two-digit and three-digit numbers. Wait, no, that would be 1 (22) + 2 (112, 121) = 3, which is option D.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.If the problem is about numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, and we're looking for counterexamples where the number is not prime, then:- Single-digit: 4 (not prime) - 1- Two-digit: 22 (not prime) - 1- Three-digit: 112 (not prime), 121 (not prime) - 2- Four-digit: 1111 (not prime) - 1Total: 5 counterexamples.But since the answer choices only go up to 4, perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers. Then, we have:Two-digit: 22 - 1Three-digit: 112, 121 - 2Four-digit: 1111 - 1Total: 4 counterexamples.Therefore, the answer would be E) 4.But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only numbers with exactly four digits, in which case only 1111 is a counterexample, making the answer B) 1.Wait, but the initial problem didn't specify the number of digits, just the sum of digits and no zeros. So, it's likely considering all such numbers, regardless of the number of digits. But since the answer choices are finite, it's probably considering numbers with up to four digits.Given that, and the initial analysis, I think the answer is 2 counterexamples, considering two-digit and three-digit numbers. Wait, no, that would be 1 + 2 = 3, which is option D.Wait, I'm getting myself in a knot here. Let me try to approach it differently.Let's list all numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, and check which are not prime.Single-digit:- 4: Not prime.Two-digit:- 13: Prime- 31: Prime- 22: Not primeThree-digit:- 112: Not prime- 121: Not prime- 211: PrimeFour-digit:- 1111: Not primeFive-digit:- 11111: Not primeSix-digit:- 111111: Not primeAnd so on.So, the counterexamples are:- 4- 22- 112- 121- 1111- 11111- 111111- etc.But since the answer choices are up to 4, perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers. Then, the counterexamples would be:- 22- 112- 121- 1111That's 4 counterexamples, so the answer would be E) 4.Alternatively, if including single-digit numbers, it's 5, but that's not an option.Alternatively, if considering only two-digit and three-digit numbers, it's 1 + 2 = 3, which is D) 3.But I think the most logical conclusion is that the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers, making the answer E) 4.However, I'm not entirely certain. Given the initial analysis, I think the answer is 2 counterexamples, but that doesn't fit with the count. Wait, no, in the initial analysis, the assistant found two counterexamples: 1111 and 121. But that seems incomplete.Wait, let me check the initial assistant's answer:\\"From the analysis, the counterexamples where the number is not prime are N = 1111 and N = 121. Thus, there are two counterexamples.\\"But in reality, there are more counterexamples: 4, 22, 112, 121, 1111, etc.So, perhaps the initial assistant missed some counterexamples. Therefore, the correct answer should be more than 2.Given the answer choices, and considering up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers, the answer is 4 counterexamples: 22, 112, 121, 1111.Therefore, the answer is E) 4.But I'm still a bit confused because the initial assistant only found two. Maybe the problem is specifically about four-digit numbers, making the answer 1. But that seems less likely.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about numbers with exactly four digits, making only 1111 a counterexample, so the answer is B) 1.But given the answer choices and the initial analysis, I think the intended answer is 2 counterexamples, but that doesn't align with the count. I'm torn between 2, 3, and 4.Wait, let's recount:- Single-digit: 4 (not prime) - 1- Two-digit: 22 (not prime) - 1- Three-digit: 112 (not prime), 121 (not prime) - 2- Four-digit: 1111 (not prime) - 1Total: 5 counterexamples.But since the answer choices are up to 4, perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to four digits, excluding single-digit numbers, making it 4 counterexamples.Therefore, the answer is E) 4.But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe the problem is about four-digit numbers only, making the answer B) 1.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about numbers with digits summing to 4 and no zeros, and the statement is about being composite, not prime. But that seems unlikely.In conclusion, considering the answer choices and the initial analysis, I think the intended answer is 2 counterexamples, but that doesn't fit with the count. Alternatively, considering up to four digits, excluding single-digit, it's 4 counterexamples. Given that, I'll go with E) 4."},{"question":"Given the quadratic polynomial ( g(x) = x^2 + ax + b ), which has exactly one root. Find the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ), given that the polynomial ( gleft(x^5 + 2x - 1right) + gleft(x^5 + 3x + 1right) ) also has exactly one root.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a quadratic polynomial ( g(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) that has exactly one root. That means it's a perfect square, right? So, it can be written as ( (x - r)^2 ) where ( r ) is the repeated root. Now, the problem also says that another polynomial, which is ( g(x^5 + 2x - 1) + g(x^5 + 3x + 1) ), also has exactly one root. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ) such that both conditions are satisfied.Let me break this down. Since ( g(x) ) has exactly one root, it must be a perfect square. So, let me write ( g(x) = (x - r)^2 ). Expanding that, it becomes ( x^2 - 2rx + r^2 ). Comparing this with the given form ( x^2 + ax + b ), I can see that ( a = -2r ) and ( b = r^2 ). So, if I can find ( r ), I can find ( a ) and ( b ).Now, moving on to the second part: ( g(x^5 + 2x - 1) + g(x^5 + 3x + 1) ) has exactly one root. Let me substitute ( g(x) = (x - r)^2 ) into this expression.So, ( g(x^5 + 2x - 1) = (x^5 + 2x - 1 - r)^2 ) and ( g(x^5 + 3x + 1) = (x^5 + 3x + 1 - r)^2 ). Adding these together, we get:[(x^5 + 2x - 1 - r)^2 + (x^5 + 3x + 1 - r)^2]This sum should have exactly one root. That means this polynomial equation equals zero only at one value of ( x ). Let me denote this polynomial as ( f(x) ):[f(x) = (x^5 + 2x - 1 - r)^2 + (x^5 + 3x + 1 - r)^2 = 0]Since both terms are squares, they are non-negative. The sum of two non-negative terms is zero only if each term is zero. Therefore, for ( f(x) = 0 ), both ( x^5 + 2x - 1 - r = 0 ) and ( x^5 + 3x + 1 - r = 0 ) must hold simultaneously.So, we have the system of equations:1. ( x^5 + 2x - 1 = r )2. ( x^5 + 3x + 1 = r )Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:[(x^5 + 3x + 1) - (x^5 + 2x - 1) = 0][(3x + 1) - (2x - 1) = 0][x + 2 = 0][x = -2]So, the only solution is ( x = -2 ). Now, let's substitute ( x = -2 ) back into one of the equations to find ( r ). Let's use the first equation:[(-2)^5 + 2(-2) - 1 = r][-32 - 4 - 1 = r][-37 = r]So, ( r = -37 ). Therefore, the quadratic polynomial ( g(x) ) is:[g(x) = (x - (-37))^2 = (x + 37)^2 = x^2 + 74x + 1369]Comparing this with ( g(x) = x^2 + ax + b ), we find that ( a = 74 ) and ( b = 1369 ).Let me just double-check my work. If ( r = -37 ), then ( a = -2r = 74 ) and ( b = r^2 = 1369 ). Plugging ( x = -2 ) into both ( x^5 + 2x - 1 ) and ( x^5 + 3x + 1 ) should give me ( r = -37 ):For ( x = -2 ):- ( (-2)^5 + 2(-2) - 1 = -32 - 4 - 1 = -37 )- ( (-2)^5 + 3(-2) + 1 = -32 - 6 + 1 = -37 )Yes, both give ( -37 ), so that checks out. Therefore, the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ) are indeed 74 and 1369, respectively.**Final Answer**The coefficients are ( a = boxed{74} ) and ( b = boxed{1369} )."},{"question":"Determine constants ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7 ) such that[ cos^7 theta = b_1 cos theta + b_2 cos 2 theta + b_3 cos 3 theta + b_4 cos 4 theta + b_5 cos 5 theta  + b_6 cos 6 theta + b_7 cos 7 theta ]for all angles ( theta ).

The problem is asking for constants b1 through b7 such that:cos^7θ = b1 cosθ + b2 cos2θ + b3 cos3θ + b4 cos4θ + b5 cos5θ + b6 cos6θ + b7 cos7θAnd then, after finding these constants, I need to calculate the sum of their squares.Hmm, I remember that powers of cosine can be expressed using multiple-angle formulas. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to expand cos^7θ. I think using complex exponentials might be a good approach here because they often simplify these kinds of expansions.Let me recall Euler's formula: e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So, cosθ can be written as (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2. That seems useful. If I can express cos^7θ in terms of exponentials, I can then expand it and convert back to cosines.So, let's write cos^7θ as [(e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2]^7. Expanding this using the binomial theorem should give me a sum of terms involving e^(ikθ) where k ranges from -7 to 7. Since cosine is an even function, the terms with e^(ikθ) and e^(-ikθ) will combine into coskθ.Let me write that out:cos^7θ = (1/2^7) * (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))^7Expanding the binomial:= (1/128) * [C(7,0)e^(i7θ) + C(7,1)e^(i5θ) + C(7,2)e^(i3θ) + C(7,3)e^(iθ) + C(7,4)e^(-iθ) + C(7,5)e^(-i3θ) + C(7,6)e^(-i5θ) + C(7,7)e^(-i7θ)]Wait, hold on, the coefficients are binomial coefficients. Let me compute those:C(7,0) = 1C(7,1) = 7C(7,2) = 21C(7,3) = 35C(7,4) = 35C(7,5) = 21C(7,6) = 7C(7,7) = 1So, plugging these in:= (1/128) [1*e^(i7θ) + 7*e^(i5θ) + 21*e^(i3θ) + 35*e^(iθ) + 35*e^(-iθ) + 21*e^(-i3θ) + 7*e^(-i5θ) + 1*e^(-i7θ)]Now, group the terms with positive and negative exponents:= (1/128) [ (e^(i7θ) + e^(-i7θ)) + 7*(e^(i5θ) + e^(-i5θ)) + 21*(e^(i3θ) + e^(-i3θ)) + 35*(e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) ]Each of these pairs can be written as 2coskθ:= (1/128) [ 2cos7θ + 14cos5θ + 42cos3θ + 70cosθ ]Simplify the coefficients by dividing each term by 128:= (1/64)cos7θ + (7/64)cos5θ + (21/64)cos3θ + (35/64)cosθSo, comparing this to the original expression, we can identify the constants:b1 = 35/64 (coefficient of cosθ)b2 = 0 (no cos2θ term)b3 = 21/64 (coefficient of cos3θ)b4 = 0 (no cos4θ term)b5 = 7/64 (coefficient of cos5θ)b6 = 0 (no cos6θ term)b7 = 1/64 (coefficient of cos7θ)Now, I need to compute the sum of the squares of these constants:b1² + b2² + b3² + b4² + b5² + b6² + b7²Plugging in the values:= (35/64)² + 0² + (21/64)² + 0² + (7/64)² + 0² + (1/64)²Let me compute each term:(35/64)² = (1225)/(4096)(21/64)² = (441)/(4096)(7/64)² = (49)/(4096)(1/64)² = (1)/(4096)Adding these up:1225 + 441 + 49 + 1 = 1716So, the sum is 1716/4096.Wait, let me check that addition again:1225 + 441 = 16661666 + 49 = 17151715 + 1 = 1716Yes, that's correct.Now, let me see if 1716 and 4096 have any common factors. 1716 divided by 4 is 429, and 4096 divided by 4 is 1024. So, simplifying:1716/4096 = 429/1024Wait, is 429 divisible by any number? Let's check:429 ÷ 3 = 143, so 429 = 3 × 143143 ÷ 11 = 13, so 143 = 11 × 13Therefore, 429 = 3 × 11 × 131024 is 2^10, so no common factors with 429. Therefore, 429/1024 is the simplified form.But wait, earlier I had 1716/4096, which simplifies to 429/1024. However, in the initial calculation, I thought the sum was 1687/4096, but that seems incorrect.Wait, let me double-check the squares:(35/64)^2 = 1225/4096(21/64)^2 = 441/4096(7/64)^2 = 49/4096(1/64)^2 = 1/4096Adding these: 1225 + 441 = 1666; 1666 + 49 = 1715; 1715 + 1 = 1716So, total is 1716/4096, which simplifies to 429/1024.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had 1687/4096. That must be a mistake because my calculation shows 1716/4096.Wait, let me check again:35^2 = 122521^2 = 4417^2 = 491^2 = 1Adding them: 1225 + 441 = 1666; 1666 + 49 = 1715; 1715 + 1 = 1716Yes, that's correct. So, 1716/4096 = 429/1024.But wait, 1716 divided by 4 is 429, and 4096 divided by 4 is 1024.So, the sum is 429/1024.But in the initial problem, the user had 1687/4096. That must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me go back.Wait, when I expanded (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))^7, I got:1*e^(i7θ) + 7*e^(i5θ) + 21*e^(i3θ) + 35*e^(iθ) + 35*e^(-iθ) + 21*e^(-i3θ) + 7*e^(-i5θ) + 1*e^(-i7θ)Then, grouping:= (1/128)[(e^(i7θ) + e^(-i7θ)) + 7*(e^(i5θ) + e^(-i5θ)) + 21*(e^(i3θ) + e^(-i3θ)) + 35*(e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))]Which becomes:= (1/128)[2cos7θ + 14cos5θ + 42cos3θ + 70cosθ]Then, dividing each term by 128:= (1/64)cos7θ + (7/64)cos5θ + (21/64)cos3θ + (35/64)cosθSo, the coefficients are correct. Therefore, the squares are:(35/64)^2 + (21/64)^2 + (7/64)^2 + (1/64)^2Which is 1225 + 441 + 49 + 1 = 1716, over 4096.So, 1716/4096 simplifies to 429/1024.Wait, but 1716 divided by 4 is 429, and 4096 divided by 4 is 1024. So, 429/1024 is the simplified fraction.Therefore, the sum of the squares is 429/1024.But in the initial problem, the user had 1687/4096. That must be incorrect. So, I think my calculation is correct.Wait, let me check the initial expansion again. Maybe I missed some terms.Wait, when I expanded (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))^7, I used the binomial coefficients correctly. Let me confirm:C(7,0)=1, C(7,1)=7, C(7,2)=21, C(7,3)=35, C(7,4)=35, C(7,5)=21, C(7,6)=7, C(7,7)=1.Yes, that's correct.So, the expansion is correct, leading to the coefficients:35/64, 21/64, 7/64, 1/64So, the sum of squares is 1716/4096 = 429/1024.Therefore, the correct answer should be 429/1024.But wait, in the initial problem, the user had 1687/4096. That must be a mistake. So, I think my calculation is correct.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me try another approach.Another way to express cos^7θ is using the multiple-angle formulas. I know that cos^7θ can be written as a sum of cosines of multiple angles using the identity for powers of cosine.The general formula for cos^nθ can be expressed using the binomial expansion as I did before, but perhaps I can use another method to verify.Alternatively, I can use the identity for cos^7θ in terms of multiple angles. Let me recall that:cos^7θ = (1/64)cos7θ + (7/64)cos5θ + (21/64)cos3θ + (35/64)cosθWhich is exactly what I got earlier. So, the coefficients are correct.Therefore, the sum of the squares is:(35/64)^2 + (21/64)^2 + (7/64)^2 + (1/64)^2 = (1225 + 441 + 49 + 1)/4096 = 1716/4096 = 429/1024.So, the final answer should be 429/1024.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had 1687/4096. That must be incorrect. So, I think my calculation is correct.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their calculation. Let me check their steps.In the initial problem, the user wrote:cos^7θ = (1/64)cos7θ + (7/64)cos5θ + (21/64)cos3θ + (35/64)cosθThen, the sum of squares is:(35/64)^2 + (21/64)^2 + (7/64)^2 + (1/64)^2 = 1225 + 441 + 49 + 1 = 1716, over 4096.But the user wrote 1687/4096. That suggests they might have miscalculated the sum of squares.Wait, perhaps they included b2, b4, b6 as non-zero? But in the expansion, those coefficients are zero, so their squares would be zero.Alternatively, maybe they included all coefficients, including the ones that are zero, but in that case, the sum would still be 1716/4096.Wait, let me check:If b1=35/64, b2=0, b3=21/64, b4=0, b5=7/64, b6=0, b7=1/64Then, the sum is:(35/64)^2 + 0 + (21/64)^2 + 0 + (7/64)^2 + 0 + (1/64)^2Which is 1225 + 0 + 441 + 0 + 49 + 0 + 1 = 1716 over 4096.So, 1716/4096 = 429/1024.Therefore, the correct answer is 429/1024.I think the initial problem had a mistake in the sum of squares, perhaps they added incorrectly or included some extra terms.So, to conclude, the constants are:b1 = 35/64b2 = 0b3 = 21/64b4 = 0b5 = 7/64b6 = 0b7 = 1/64And the sum of their squares is 429/1024.I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"If the complex number z satisfies (sqrt{2}+i)z=3i (where i is the imaginary unit), then the conjugate of z isA: sqrt{2}+iB: sqrt{2}-iC: 1+sqrt{2}iD: 1-sqrt{2}i","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the conjugate of a complex number z. The equation given is (√2 + i)z = 3i. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that to solve for z, I need to isolate it. Since z is being multiplied by (√2 + i), I can divide both sides of the equation by (√2 + i) to get z by itself. So, z equals 3i divided by (√2 + i). That makes sense.But dividing by a complex number isn't straightforward like dividing by a real number. I recall that to simplify expressions like this, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (√2 + i) is (√2 - i). Multiplying by the conjugate helps eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator.So, let me write that out: z = (3i) / (√2 + i). To simplify, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by (√2 - i). That gives me z = [3i * (√2 - i)] / [(√2 + i)(√2 - i)].Now, let me work on the denominator first because that's usually simpler. Multiplying (√2 + i) by (√2 - i) is a difference of squares, so it should be (√2)^2 - (i)^2. Calculating that, (√2)^2 is 2, and (i)^2 is -1. So, 2 - (-1) equals 3. That simplifies the denominator to 3, which is nice because it makes the overall fraction easier to handle.Now, moving on to the numerator: 3i multiplied by (√2 - i). Let me distribute the 3i across the terms inside the parentheses. That gives me 3i * √2 minus 3i * i. Simplifying each term, 3i * √2 is 3√2 i, and 3i * i is 3i². But wait, i² is equal to -1, so 3i² is 3*(-1) which is -3. So, putting it all together, the numerator becomes 3√2 i - 3.So now, z is equal to (3√2 i - 3) divided by 3. I can factor out a 3 from the numerator, which gives me 3(√2 i - 1) over 3. The 3s cancel out, leaving me with √2 i - 1. So, z is √2 i - 1.But the question asks for the conjugate of z, not z itself. The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So, if z is √2 i - 1, which can also be written as -1 + √2 i, then the conjugate of z, denoted as (overline{z}), should be -1 - √2 i.Wait, let me double-check that. If z is -1 + √2 i, then the conjugate would indeed flip the sign of the imaginary part, so it becomes -1 - √2 i. Hmm, looking at the answer choices, I see options A through D. Let me check them again:A: √2 + i  B: √2 - i  C: 1 + √2 i  D: 1 - √2 iHmm, my result is -1 - √2 i, which isn't exactly one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me go back through my steps.Starting again, z = (3i) / (√2 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 - i):Numerator: 3i * (√2 - i) = 3i√2 - 3i²  Denominator: (√2 + i)(√2 - i) = 2 - i² = 2 - (-1) = 3So, numerator is 3i√2 - 3*(-1) = 3i√2 + 3. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 3√2 i - 3, but now I'm getting 3√2 i + 3. Did I mess up the signs?Wait, 3i * (√2 - i) is 3i√2 - 3i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 3i√2 - 3*(-1) = 3i√2 + 3. So, numerator is 3 + 3√2 i. Then, z = (3 + 3√2 i)/3 = 1 + √2 i.Oh! So, z is 1 + √2 i. Therefore, the conjugate of z, which is (overline{z}), would be 1 - √2 i. That matches option D.Wait, so earlier I thought z was √2 i - 1, but actually, it's 1 + √2 i. I must have made a sign error when distributing the 3i. Let me verify:3i * √2 is 3√2 i, correct. 3i * (-i) is -3i², which is -3*(-1) = +3. So, numerator is 3√2 i + 3, which is 3 + 3√2 i. Divided by 3, that's 1 + √2 i. Yes, that makes sense.So, z is 1 + √2 i, so its conjugate is 1 - √2 i, which is option D. That seems correct now.I think my initial mistake was in the distribution step where I incorrectly subtracted 3 instead of adding. It's important to carefully handle the signs when dealing with complex numbers. Once I corrected that, everything fell into place.So, to recap:1. Start with (√2 + i)z = 3i.2. Solve for z by dividing both sides by (√2 + i).3. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√2 - i) to simplify.4. Expand and simplify both numerator and denominator.5. Realize that the numerator becomes 3 + 3√2 i, leading to z = 1 + √2 i.6. Find the conjugate by changing the sign of the imaginary part, resulting in 1 - √2 i.7. Match this with the given options to find that D is the correct answer.This process helped me identify where I went wrong initially and correct my approach to arrive at the right solution. It's a good reminder to always double-check my steps, especially when dealing with signs and complex numbers.Another thing I noticed is that sometimes when dealing with complex conjugates, it's helpful to remember properties like (overline{z_1 z_2} = overline{z_1} overline{z_2}) and (overline{z_1 + z_2} = overline{z_1} + overline{z_2}). Maybe I can use these properties to solve the problem differently.Starting from the original equation: (√2 + i)z = 3i.Taking the conjugate of both sides: (overline{(sqrt{2} + i)z} = overline{3i}).Using the property that (overline{z_1 z_2} = overline{z_1} overline{z_2}), this becomes (overline{sqrt{2} + i} cdot overline{z} = overline{3i}).Compute each conjugate:- (overline{sqrt{2} + i} = sqrt{2} - i)- (overline{3i} = -3i)So, the equation becomes: (√2 - i) * (overline{z}) = -3i.Now, solve for (overline{z}):(overline{z}) = (-3i) / (√2 - i).Again, to simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (√2 + i):(overline{z}) = [(-3i)(√2 + i)] / [(√2 - i)(√2 + i)].Compute the denominator first: (√2)^2 - (i)^2 = 2 - (-1) = 3.Now, the numerator: (-3i)(√2 + i) = -3i√2 - 3i².Simplify each term:- -3i√2 remains as is.- -3i² = -3*(-1) = 3.So, numerator is -3√2 i + 3, which can be written as 3 - 3√2 i.Therefore, (overline{z}) = (3 - 3√2 i)/3 = 1 - √2 i.This confirms the earlier result. So, using the conjugate properties also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring.It's interesting how different approaches can lead to the same solution. Whether I solve for z first and then take its conjugate or take the conjugate of the entire equation and solve for (overline{z}) directly, I end up with the same result. This cross-verification is a good practice to ensure that my answer is correct.I also remember that another way to represent complex numbers is in polar form, which might be useful in some cases. However, in this problem, since the equation is straightforward and involves only multiplication by a complex number, using algebraic manipulation seems more efficient.Just to recap the steps once more for clarity:1. **Original Equation**: (√2 + i)z = 3i.2. **Solve for z**: z = 3i / (√2 + i).3. **Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator**:   - Numerator: 3i * (√2 - i) = 3√2 i - 3i² = 3√2 i + 3.   - Denominator: (√2 + i)(√2 - i) = 2 - i² = 3.4. **Simplify**: z = (3 + 3√2 i)/3 = 1 + √2 i.5. **Find the conjugate**: (overline{z}) = 1 - √2 i.6. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is D.This systematic approach helps prevent errors and ensures that each step is clear. I think I've got a solid understanding of how to handle such problems now. It's all about carefully applying the properties of complex numbers and not getting tripped up by the signs or the order of operations.Another point to consider is that sometimes problems like this can be approached using matrices or geometric interpretations, but for this case, basic algebra suffices. It's always good to know multiple methods, though, as different problems might call for different techniques.In summary, solving for z by isolating it through division, simplifying using the conjugate, and then finding the conjugate of the result was the key to solving this problem.

Hmm, that sounds like setting up some equations and solving for the matrix entries. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me denote the matrix N as:N = [ [p, q],       [r, s] ]So, N is a 2x2 matrix with entries p, q, r, s. Now, I need to figure out what these entries are.Given that N multiplied by [2, 1] gives [5, -3], let me write that out as an equation. Matrix multiplication works by taking the dot product of the rows of N with the columns of the vector. So, the first entry of the resulting vector is p*2 + q*1, and the second entry is r*2 + s*1. So, that gives me two equations:1) 2p + q = 52) 2r + s = -3Similarly, when N is multiplied by [1, -2], the result is [7, -8]. So, the first entry is p*1 + q*(-2) = p - 2q, and the second entry is r*1 + s*(-2) = r - 2s. That gives me two more equations:3) p - 2q = 74) r - 2s = -8So now I have four equations:1) 2p + q = 52) 2r + s = -33) p - 2q = 74) r - 2s = -8I need to solve for p, q, r, s. Let me tackle p and q first using equations 1 and 3.From equation 1: 2p + q = 5From equation 3: p - 2q = 7I can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let me try that.If I multiply equation 3 by 2, I get:2*(p - 2q) = 2*7 => 2p - 4q = 14Now, subtract equation 1 from this new equation:(2p - 4q) - (2p + q) = 14 - 52p - 4q - 2p - q = 9-5q = 9So, q = -9/5? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps.Wait, no, when I subtract equation 1 from the multiplied equation, it should be:(2p - 4q) - (2p + q) = 14 - 52p - 4q - 2p - q = 9-5q = 9Yes, that's correct. So, q = -9/5. Hmm, that's a negative fraction. Let me see if that makes sense.Wait, let me double-check the equations:Equation 1: 2p + q = 5Equation 3: p - 2q = 7If I solve equation 3 for p: p = 7 + 2qThen substitute into equation 1: 2*(7 + 2q) + q = 514 + 4q + q = 514 + 5q = 55q = 5 - 145q = -9q = -9/5Okay, so that's correct. So, q is -9/5. Then, p = 7 + 2*(-9/5) = 7 - 18/5 = (35/5 - 18/5) = 17/5.So, p = 17/5 and q = -9/5.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had a different solution where p was 1 and q was 3.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.Wait, let me write down the equations again:From N*[2,1] = [5, -3]:2p + q = 52r + s = -3From N*[1, -2] = [7, -8]:p - 2q = 7r - 2s = -8So, equations 1 and 3 are correct.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving. Let me try solving equations 1 and 3 again.Equation 1: 2p + q = 5Equation 3: p - 2q = 7Let me solve equation 3 for p: p = 7 + 2qSubstitute into equation 1: 2*(7 + 2q) + q = 514 + 4q + q = 514 + 5q = 55q = 5 - 145q = -9q = -9/5So, p = 7 + 2*(-9/5) = 7 - 18/5 = (35/5 - 18/5) = 17/5Hmm, so p=17/5 and q=-9/5. That seems correct.Wait, but in the initial solution, the user had p=1, q=3, r=2/3, s=-13/3. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me check the initial setup again.Wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote:N*[2,1] = [5, -3]N*[1, -2] = [7, -8]So, in my setup, I wrote:2p + q = 52r + s = -3p - 2q = 7r - 2s = -8Wait, but in the initial solution, the user had:2p + q = 52r + s = -3p - 2q = 7r - 2s = -8Which is the same as mine. So, why did the user get p=1, q=3, r=2/3, s=-13/3?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the equations again.Wait, no, the equations seem correct. So, perhaps the initial solution was incorrect.Wait, let me try solving the system again.From equation 1: 2p + q = 5From equation 3: p - 2q = 7Let me solve equation 3 for p: p = 7 + 2qSubstitute into equation 1: 2*(7 + 2q) + q = 514 + 4q + q = 514 + 5q = 55q = 5 - 145q = -9q = -9/5Then p = 7 + 2*(-9/5) = 7 - 18/5 = (35/5 - 18/5) = 17/5So, p=17/5, q=-9/5.Similarly, let's solve for r and s using equations 2 and 4.Equation 2: 2r + s = -3Equation 4: r - 2s = -8Let me solve equation 4 for r: r = -8 + 2sSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(-8 + 2s) + s = -3-16 + 4s + s = -3-16 + 5s = -35s = -3 + 165s = 13s = 13/5Then r = -8 + 2*(13/5) = -8 + 26/5 = (-40/5 + 26/5) = (-14/5)So, r = -14/5 and s = 13/5.Wait, so putting it all together, the matrix N would be:[17/5, -9/5][-14/5, 13/5]Hmm, that's different from the initial solution. So, perhaps the initial solution was incorrect.Wait, let me check the initial solution again.The initial solution had:N = [[1, 3],     [2/3, -13/3]]Let me test if this matrix satisfies the given conditions.First, multiply N by [2,1]:[1*2 + 3*1, 1*1 + 3*1] = [2 + 3, 1 + 3] = [5, 4]Wait, but the result should be [5, -3]. So, the second entry is 4 instead of -3. That's incorrect.Similarly, multiply N by [1, -2]:[1*1 + 3*(-2), 1*(-2) + 3*(-2)] = [1 - 6, -2 -6] = [-5, -8]Wait, the first entry should be 7, but it's -5. So, that's incorrect.So, the initial solution is wrong. Therefore, my solution must be correct.Wait, but let me test my solution to make sure.My matrix N is:[17/5, -9/5][-14/5, 13/5]Let me compute N*[2,1]:First entry: (17/5)*2 + (-9/5)*1 = 34/5 - 9/5 = 25/5 = 5Second entry: (-14/5)*2 + (13/5)*1 = -28/5 + 13/5 = (-15)/5 = -3So, that gives [5, -3], which is correct.Now, N*[1, -2]:First entry: (17/5)*1 + (-9/5)*(-2) = 17/5 + 18/5 = 35/5 = 7Second entry: (-14/5)*1 + (13/5)*(-2) = -14/5 -26/5 = (-40)/5 = -8So, that gives [7, -8], which is correct.Therefore, my solution is correct, and the initial solution was incorrect.Wait, but the initial solution had p=1, q=3, r=2/3, s=-13/3, which didn't satisfy the conditions. So, perhaps the initial solution was wrong.Therefore, the correct matrix N is:[17/5, -9/5][-14/5, 13/5]Alternatively, I can write it as fractions:[17/5, -9/5][-14/5, 13/5]But perhaps I can write it with a common denominator or simplify if possible.Alternatively, I can write it as:[3.4, -1.8][-2.8, 2.6]But fractions are more precise.Wait, let me see if I can simplify the fractions:17/5 is already in simplest form.-9/5 is simplest.-14/5 is simplest.13/5 is simplest.So, that's the matrix.Alternatively, I can factor out 1/5:(1/5)*[17, -9;        -14, 13]But I think writing it as separate fractions is fine.So, the final answer is:N = [[17/5, -9/5],     [-14/5, 13/5]]I think that's correct."},{"question":"A regular quadrilateral pyramid is given. The side of the base is 6, and the length of a lateral edge is 5. Sphere ( Q_{1} ) is inscribed in the pyramid. Sphere ( Q_{2} ) touches ( Q_{1} ) and all the lateral faces of the pyramid. Find the radius of sphere ( Q_{2} ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular quadrilateral pyramid. Let me try to visualize it first. A regular quadrilateral pyramid has a square base, right? So the base is a square with each side measuring 6 units. The lateral edges, which are the edges from the base to the apex, are each 5 units long. The problem mentions two spheres: Q₁ and Q₂. Sphere Q₁ is inscribed in the pyramid, which means it's tangent to all the faces of the pyramid. Sphere Q₂ touches Q₁ and all the lateral faces of the pyramid. I need to find the radius of sphere Q₂.First, I think I need to find some key measurements of the pyramid. Since it's a regular pyramid, the apex is directly above the center of the square base. Let me denote the base square as ABCD with side length 6, and the apex as M. The center of the base is point E, and the midpoint of one of the base edges, say CD, is point F.To find the height of the pyramid, I might need to use the Pythagorean theorem. The lateral edge is given as 5 units. If I consider triangle MFC, where F is the midpoint of CD, then FC is half of CD, so FC = 3 units. The length of MF, which is the slant height or the apothem of the pyramid, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle MFC.So, MF² = MC² - FC². Plugging in the numbers, MF² = 5² - 3² = 25 - 9 = 16. Therefore, MF = 4 units. That gives me the apothem of the pyramid.Now, to find the height of the pyramid (ME), I can consider triangle MEF, where EF is the distance from the center E to the midpoint F. Since the base is a square with side 6, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is half of the side length, so EF = 3 units.Using the Pythagorean theorem again in triangle MEF, ME² = MF² - EF². So ME² = 4² - 3² = 16 - 9 = 7. Therefore, ME = √7 units. That's the height of the pyramid.Next, I think I need to find the volume and the surface area of the pyramid to determine the radius of the inscribed sphere Q₁. The volume V of a pyramid is given by (1/3) * base area * height. The base area is 6² = 36. So V = (1/3) * 36 * √7 = 12√7.The surface area S of the pyramid includes the base and the four triangular faces. The base area is 36. Each triangular face has an area of (1/2) * base * slant height. The slant height is MF = 4, and the base of each triangle is 6. So each triangular face has an area of (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12. There are four such faces, so the total lateral surface area is 4 * 12 = 48. Adding the base area, the total surface area S = 36 + 48 = 84.The radius of the inscribed sphere Q₁ can be found using the formula r₁ = 3V / S. Plugging in the values, r₁ = (3 * 12√7) / 84 = (36√7) / 84 = (3√7) / 7.Now, moving on to sphere Q₂. It touches Q₁ and all the lateral faces. I think this means that Q₂ is tangent to Q₁ and also tangent to each of the four triangular faces. So, Q₂ is smaller than Q₁ and sits inside the pyramid, touching Q₁ and the lateral faces.To find the radius of Q₂, I might need to consider the similar pyramids. When sphere Q₁ is inscribed, it touches the base and the lateral faces. Sphere Q₂, being tangent to Q₁ and the lateral faces, suggests that there is a smaller, similar pyramid inside the original one, where Q₂ is inscribed in this smaller pyramid.The key here is to find the scaling factor between the original pyramid and the smaller pyramid. Since Q₂ is tangent to Q₁, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii, which is r₁ + r₂.But wait, actually, since Q₂ is inside the original pyramid and tangent to Q₁, the distance between their centers should be equal to r₁ - r₂, because Q₂ is inside Q₁. Hmm, I need to be careful here.Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the heights. The height of the original pyramid is √7. The height of the smaller pyramid, where Q₂ is inscribed, would be less by twice the radius of Q₁, because Q₁ is touching the base and the lateral faces.Wait, actually, the inscribed sphere Q₁ touches the base and the lateral faces, so the distance from the apex to the center of Q₁ is equal to the height of the pyramid minus the radius of Q₁. Similarly, the center of Q₂ would be at a distance equal to the height of the smaller pyramid minus its radius.This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should use similar triangles or the concept of similar pyramids.Let me denote h₁ as the height of the original pyramid, which is √7, and h₂ as the height of the smaller pyramid where Q₂ is inscribed. The ratio of similarity k between the smaller pyramid and the original one would be h₂ / h₁.Since Q₂ is tangent to Q₁, the distance between their centers is r₁ + r₂. But the centers are along the central axis of the pyramid. The center of Q₁ is at a distance of r₁ from the base, and the center of Q₂ is at a distance of r₂ from the base of the smaller pyramid, which is actually the same as the base of the original pyramid plus some distance.Wait, maybe it's better to consider the distance from the apex. The center of Q₁ is at a distance of h₁ - r₁ from the apex, and the center of Q₂ is at a distance of h₂ - r₂ from the apex. Since Q₂ is tangent to Q₁, the distance between their centers should be r₁ + r₂.So, (h₁ - r₁) - (h₂ - r₂) = r₁ + r₂. Simplifying, h₁ - r₁ - h₂ + r₂ = r₁ + r₂. Then, h₁ - h₂ - r₁ = r₁. So, h₁ - h₂ = 2r₁. Therefore, h₂ = h₁ - 2r₁.Plugging in the known values, h₂ = √7 - 2*(3√7/7) = √7 - (6√7/7) = (7√7 - 6√7)/7 = √7/7.So, the height of the smaller pyramid is √7/7. The ratio of similarity k is h₂ / h₁ = (√7/7) / √7 = 1/7.Since the pyramids are similar, the radii of their inscribed spheres will scale by the same ratio. Therefore, r₂ = k * r₁ = (1/7)*(3√7/7) = 3√7/49.So, the radius of sphere Q₂ is 3√7/49.I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my steps.1. Found the apothem MF = 4 using Pythagoras.2. Found the height ME = √7 using Pythagoras again.3. Calculated volume V = 12√7.4. Calculated surface area S = 84.5. Found r₁ = 3V/S = 3√7/7.6. Considered the smaller pyramid with height h₂ = h₁ - 2r₁ = √7 - 6√7/7 = √7/7.7. Found the similarity ratio k = 1/7.8. Therefore, r₂ = k * r₁ = 3√7/49.Yes, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think the radius of sphere Q₂ is indeed 3√7/49."},{"question":"two motor bikes cover the same distance at the speed of 60 and 64 kmps respectively . find the distance traveled by them if the slower bike takes 1 hour more than the faster bike ?","answer":"I need to find the distance traveled by two motor bikes that cover the same distance at speeds of 60 km/h and 64 km/h, with the slower bike taking 1 hour more than the faster bike.First, I'll define the distance as ( D ) kilometers.For the slower bike:- Speed = 60 km/h- Time taken = ( T ) hours- Distance = Speed × Time → ( D = 60T )For the faster bike:- Speed = 64 km/h- Time taken = ( T - 1 ) hours (since it takes 1 hour less)- Distance = Speed × Time → ( D = 64(T - 1) )Since both distances are equal, I can set the two equations equal to each other:[ 60T = 64(T - 1) ]Expanding and simplifying:[ 60T = 64T - 64 ][ 64 = 64T - 60T ][ 64 = 4T ][ T = frac{64}{4} ][ T = 16 ]Now, using the time for the slower bike to find the distance:[ D = 60 times 16 = 960 ]Therefore, the distance traveled by both bikes is 960 kilometers."},{"question":"Given that alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, and sin(alpha + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{1}{3}, find sin(2alpha + frac{pi}{3}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where α is an angle in the second quadrant, and I know that sin(α + π/6) equals 1/3. I need to find sin(2α + π/3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that angles in the second quadrant are between π/2 and π. So, α is somewhere in that range. When they say α is in the second quadrant, that also affects the signs of sine and cosine for α. In the second quadrant, sine is positive and cosine is negative. That might come into play later.Now, the given equation is sin(α + π/6) = 1/3. I need to find sin(2α + π/3). Hmm, I notice that 2α + π/3 is just twice the angle (α + π/6). Because if I let θ = α + π/6, then 2θ would be 2α + π/3. So, sin(2θ) is what I need to find.I remember the double-angle formula for sine: sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So, if I can find cosθ, where θ = α + π/6, then I can compute sin(2θ).Given that sinθ = 1/3, I can use the Pythagorean identity to find cosθ. The identity is sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So, cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - (1/3)² = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9. Therefore, cosθ = ±√(8/9) = ±2√2/3.Now, I need to determine the sign of cosθ. Since θ = α + π/6, and α is in the second quadrant, let's figure out where θ is. If α is between π/2 and π, then θ = α + π/6 would be between π/2 + π/6 = 2π/3 and π + π/6 = 7π/6. So, θ is between 2π/3 and 7π/6.Looking at the unit circle, 2π/3 is in the second quadrant, and 7π/6 is in the third quadrant. So, θ could be in either the second or third quadrant depending on the exact value of α. However, since sinθ is positive (1/3), θ must be in the second quadrant because sine is positive in the second quadrant and negative in the third. Therefore, cosθ is negative in the second quadrant. So, cosθ = -2√2/3.Now, using the double-angle formula: sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ = 2*(1/3)*(-2√2/3) = 2*(1/3)*(-2√2/3) = (2/3)*(-2√2/3) = (-4√2)/9.So, sin(2α + π/3) = sin(2θ) = -4√2/9.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by recognizing that 2α + π/3 is twice the angle θ = α + π/6. Then, I used the double-angle formula, which requires both sine and cosine of θ. I found cosθ using the Pythagorean identity and determined the sign based on the quadrant of θ. Since θ is in the second quadrant, cosine is negative. Then, I multiplied everything out correctly. It seems right.I think that's the correct answer. So, sin(2α + π/3) is -4√2/9."},{"question":"A bag contains 10 green and 8 white balls.

The probability of drawing the first green ball is 10 out of 18. After drawing one green ball, there are 9 green balls left out of a total of 17 balls. So, the probability of drawing a second green ball is 9 out of 17. Multiplying these probabilities gives the chance of drawing two green balls.Then, I'll calculate the probability of drawing two white balls. The probability of drawing the first white ball is 8 out of 18. After drawing one white ball, there are 7 white balls left out of a total of 17 balls. So, the probability of drawing a second white ball is 7 out of 17. Multiplying these probabilities gives the chance of drawing two white balls.Finally, I'll add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the total probability that both balls drawn are of the same color.

What is the positive difference between the two numbers?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: The sum of two numbers is 10, and the difference of their squares is 20. I need to find the positive difference between the two numbers. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.First, I'll call the two numbers x and y. According to the problem, their sum is 10, so I can write that as:x + y = 10That's straightforward. Now, the second part says the difference of their squares is 20. So, that would be:x² - y² = 20Hmm, I remember that x² - y² can be factored into (x + y)(x - y). Maybe that can help me here. Let me try that:x² - y² = (x + y)(x - y) = 20But I already know that x + y is 10 from the first equation. So I can substitute that in:10 * (x - y) = 20Now, to find x - y, I can divide both sides by 10:x - y = 20 / 10x - y = 2So, the difference between x and y is 2. Since the problem asks for the positive difference, I don't need to worry about the order, just the absolute value, which is already positive here.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If x - y is 2, and x + y is 10, I can solve for x and y to confirm.Adding the two equations:x + y = 10x - y = 2Adding them:2x = 12x = 6Then, substituting back into x + y = 10:6 + y = 10y = 4So, the numbers are 6 and 4.

In how many ways can we choose a president, a vice-president, and a treasurer if the president and the vice-president must be of the same gender, but the treasurer can be of any gender not holding a previous office?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a club with 30 members, half boys and half girls, so 15 boys and 15 girls. I need to figure out how many ways we can choose a president, a vice-president, and a treasurer. The conditions are that the president and the vice-president must be of the same gender, but the treasurer can be of any gender, as long as they're not holding a previous office. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to choose a president. Since there are 30 members, the president can be any one of them. So, there are 30 possible choices for president. Now, once the president is chosen, the vice-president has to be of the same gender. So, if the president is a boy, then the vice-president has to be one of the remaining 14 boys. Similarly, if the president is a girl, the vice-president has to be one of the remaining 14 girls. So, for the vice-president, there are 14 choices regardless of whether the president is a boy or a girl. That makes sense because we're excluding the president from the pool, and since they have to be the same gender, we're left with 14 members of that gender. Now, moving on to the treasurer. The treasurer can be any gender, but they can't be someone who's already holding an office, meaning they can't be the president or the vice-president. So, after choosing the president and the vice-president, we've already selected two people, leaving us with 28 members. Therefore, there are 28 choices for the treasurer. Wait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the president is 30 choices, vice-president is 14 choices, and treasurer is 28 choices. To find the total number of ways, I need to multiply these together, right? So, 30 multiplied by 14 multiplied by 28. Let me calculate that. 30 times 14 is 420, and 420 times 28 is... let's see, 420 times 20 is 8,400, and 420 times 8 is 3,360. Adding those together gives 11,760. So, the total number of ways is 11,760. But hold on, I feel like I might be overcounting here. Is there a different way to approach this? Maybe by considering the cases where the president and vice-president are both boys or both girls separately? Let's try that. Case 1: President and vice-president are both boys. There are 15 boys, so choosing a president is 15 choices. Then, the vice-president would be 14 choices, as one boy is already chosen as president. Then, the treasurer can be any of the remaining 28 members, since two positions are already filled. So, 15 times 14 times 28. Case 2: President and vice-president are both girls. Similarly, there are 15 girls, so president is 15 choices, vice-president is 14 choices, and treasurer is 28 choices. So, 15 times 14 times 28. Adding both cases together, we get (15×14×28) + (15×14×28) = 2×(15×14×28). Let's compute that. 15×14 is 210, and 210×28 is 5,880. Then, 2×5,880 is 11,760. Okay, so both methods give me the same result, 11,760. That makes me more confident that this is the correct answer. I think my initial approach was correct, and breaking it down into cases also leads to the same total. I guess another way to think about it is that regardless of the gender of the president and vice-president, the number of choices for each position remains the same. So, whether it's boys or girls, the calculation is symmetrical, which is why adding the two cases together just doubles the result of one case. So, in conclusion, the total number of ways to choose a president, vice-president, and treasurer under the given conditions is 11,760."},{"question":"For the function f(x)=frac{ln x}{x}, the number of correct statements is:①f(x) reaches its maximum value frac{{1}}{e} at x=e;②f(x) has two different zero points;③f(4) < f(π) < f(3);④π^{4} < 4^{π}.A: 4B: 3C: 2D: 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the function ( f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} ), and I need to figure out how many of the given statements are correct. The statements are:1. ( f(x) ) reaches its maximum value ( frac{1}{e} ) at ( x = e ).2. ( f(x) ) has two different zero points.3. ( f(4) < f(pi) < f(3) ).4. ( pi^{4} < 4^{pi} ).And the options are A: 4, B: 3, C: 2, D: 1.Alright, let's take this step by step. I remember that for functions involving logarithms and exponentials, calculus, especially derivatives, can be really helpful. Maybe I should start by finding the derivative of ( f(x) ) to understand its behavior.So, ( f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} ). To find the derivative, I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule says that if I have ( frac{u}{v} ), the derivative is ( frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} ).Let me set ( u = ln x ) and ( v = x ). Then, ( u' = frac{1}{x} ) and ( v' = 1 ).Plugging into the quotient rule:( f'(x) = frac{(frac{1}{x})(x) - (ln x)(1)}{x^2} ).Simplifying the numerator:( frac{1}{x} times x = 1 ), so numerator becomes ( 1 - ln x ).Therefore, ( f'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2} ).Okay, so the derivative is ( frac{1 - ln x}{x^2} ). Now, to find critical points, I need to set ( f'(x) = 0 ).So, ( frac{1 - ln x}{x^2} = 0 ).Since ( x^2 ) is always positive for ( x neq 0 ), the equation simplifies to ( 1 - ln x = 0 ).Solving for ( x ):( 1 = ln x )Exponentiating both sides:( e^1 = x ), so ( x = e ).So, the critical point is at ( x = e ). Now, to determine if this is a maximum or a minimum, I can look at the sign of the derivative around ( x = e ).Let's pick a value less than ( e ), say ( x = 2 ):( f'(2) = frac{1 - ln 2}{4} ). Since ( ln 2 ) is approximately 0.693, so ( 1 - 0.693 = 0.307 ). So, positive. Therefore, the function is increasing before ( x = e ).Now, pick a value greater than ( e ), say ( x = 4 ):( f'(4) = frac{1 - ln 4}{16} ). ( ln 4 ) is about 1.386, so ( 1 - 1.386 = -0.386 ). Negative. So, the function is decreasing after ( x = e ).Therefore, ( x = e ) is a maximum point. So, statement 1 is correct because ( f(e) = frac{ln e}{e} = frac{1}{e} ), which is the maximum value.Moving on to statement 2: ( f(x) ) has two different zero points.Zero points occur where ( f(x) = 0 ). So, set ( frac{ln x}{x} = 0 ).The numerator must be zero, so ( ln x = 0 ). Solving this, ( x = 1 ). So, there's only one zero point at ( x = 1 ). Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.Statement 3: ( f(4) < f(pi) < f(3) ).Hmm, so I need to compare ( f(4) ), ( f(pi) ), and ( f(3) ).Given that ( f(x) ) has a maximum at ( x = e ) and is decreasing for ( x > e ). Since ( e ) is approximately 2.718, so 3 is just a bit larger than ( e ), and ( pi ) is about 3.1416, which is larger than 3, and 4 is larger than ( pi ).So, since ( f(x) ) is decreasing for ( x > e ), the larger the ( x ), the smaller the value of ( f(x) ). Therefore, ( f(4) < f(pi) < f(3) ). So, statement 3 is correct.Statement 4: ( pi^{4} < 4^{pi} ).This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can use the function ( f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} ) to compare ( pi ) and 4.From statement 3, we have ( f(4) < f(pi) ). So, ( frac{ln 4}{4} < frac{ln pi}{pi} ).Let me write that inequality:( frac{ln 4}{4} < frac{ln pi}{pi} ).If I cross-multiply, since all terms are positive, the inequality remains the same:( pi ln 4 < 4 ln pi ).Now, exponentiating both sides to get rid of the logarithms:( e^{pi ln 4} < e^{4 ln pi} ).Simplify the exponents:( e^{pi ln 4} = 4^{pi} ) because ( e^{ln a^b} = a^b ).Similarly, ( e^{4 ln pi} = pi^{4} ).So, the inequality becomes:( 4^{pi} < pi^{4} ).Wait, that's the opposite of statement 4. Statement 4 says ( pi^{4} < 4^{pi} ), but according to this, ( 4^{pi} < pi^{4} ). So, statement 4 is incorrect.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the exponentiation step. Let me double-check.Starting from ( pi ln 4 < 4 ln pi ).If I exponentiate both sides, I get:( e^{pi ln 4} < e^{4 ln pi} ).Which simplifies to:( 4^{pi} < pi^{4} ).Yes, that's correct. So, statement 4 is incorrect because ( pi^{4} ) is actually greater than ( 4^{pi} ).Wait, but I thought statement 3 was correct, which was ( f(4) < f(pi) < f(3) ). So, that led me to statement 4 being incorrect.But let me verify numerically to be sure.Calculate ( pi^4 ) and ( 4^{pi} ).First, ( pi ) is approximately 3.1416.So, ( pi^4 ) is ( (3.1416)^4 ). Let's compute that:( 3.1416^2 approx 9.8696 ).Then, ( 9.8696^2 approx 97.409 ).So, ( pi^4 approx 97.409 ).Now, ( 4^{pi} ). Since ( pi approx 3.1416 ), ( 4^{3.1416} ).We know that ( 4^3 = 64 ), and ( 4^{0.1416} ) is approximately ( e^{0.1416 ln 4} ).Compute ( 0.1416 times ln 4 ). ( ln 4 approx 1.386 ). So, ( 0.1416 times 1.386 approx 0.196 ).Thus, ( e^{0.196} approx 1.216 ).Therefore, ( 4^{3.1416} approx 64 times 1.216 approx 77.824 ).So, ( pi^4 approx 97.409 ) and ( 4^{pi} approx 77.824 ). Therefore, ( pi^4 > 4^{pi} ), so statement 4 is indeed incorrect.Wait, but in the initial analysis, statement 3 was correct because ( f(4) < f(pi) < f(3) ). So, that seems correct because ( f(x) ) is decreasing for ( x > e ), and 4 > π > 3, so their function values decrease accordingly.But statement 4 is incorrect because ( pi^4 ) is actually greater than ( 4^{pi} ).So, summarizing:1. Correct.2. Incorrect.3. Correct.4. Incorrect.So, out of the four statements, two are correct: statements 1 and 3.Therefore, the number of correct statements is 2, which corresponds to option C.Wait, but hold on, in my initial analysis, I thought statement 4 was incorrect, but let me verify once more because sometimes exponentials can be tricky.Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms to compare ( pi^4 ) and ( 4^{pi} ).Take the natural logarithm of both sides:( ln(pi^4) ) vs. ( ln(4^{pi}) ).Simplify:( 4 ln pi ) vs. ( pi ln 4 ).We can compute both values numerically.Compute ( 4 ln pi ):( ln pi approx 1.1447 ).So, ( 4 times 1.1447 approx 4.5788 ).Compute ( pi ln 4 ):( ln 4 approx 1.3863 ).So, ( 3.1416 times 1.3863 approx 4.3429 ).Therefore, ( 4 ln pi approx 4.5788 ) and ( pi ln 4 approx 4.3429 ).Since ( 4.5788 > 4.3429 ), we have ( ln(pi^4) > ln(4^{pi}) ), which implies ( pi^4 > 4^{pi} ).So, statement 4 is indeed incorrect.Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making the number of correct statements 2, which is option C."},{"question":"In a graduating class, 40 percent of the students are male, and the class consists of students with three different academic majors - A, B, and C. The distribution of students among major A is 50%, major B is 30%, and major C is 20%. In this class, 50 percent of the male students and 30 percent of the female students are 25 years old or older. Additionally, the students in major A have a 60% probability of being 25 years or older, major B students have a 40% probability, and major C students have a 20% probability.If a student from this graduating class is randomly selected, approximately what is the probability that he or she will be: a) less than 25 years old and studying major A,b) between 25 and 29 years old and studying major B, and c) older than 29 years old and studying major C?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about probabilities in a graduating class, and I need to find the probabilities for three different scenarios. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the class is composed of 40% male students and 60% female students. The students are distributed among three majors: A, B, and C, with 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. Now, regarding age, 50% of the male students and 30% of the female students are 25 years old or older. Additionally, the probability of being 25 years or older varies by major: 60% for major A, 40% for major B, and 20% for major C.Okay, so for part a), I need to find the probability that a randomly selected student is less than 25 years old and studying major A. Hmm, so I know that 50% of the students are in major A, and 60% of those are 25 or older. That means 40% of major A students are less than 25. So, if I multiply the probability of being in major A by the probability of being less than 25 in that major, I should get the answer. That would be 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2, or 20%.For part b), I need the probability of being between 25 and 29 years old and studying major B. Wait, the problem only gives me the probability of being 25 or older, not the exact distribution between 25-29 and older than 29. So, I don't have enough information to directly calculate this. Maybe I can assume that the 40% of major B students who are 25 or older are split evenly between 25-29 and older than 29? That might not be accurate, though. Without specific data, I'm stuck here.Similarly, for part c), I need the probability of being older than 29 and studying major C. Again, the problem only tells me that 20% of major C students are 25 or older, but it doesn't specify how many are older than 29. So, like part b), I don't have enough information to calculate this precisely.Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps I can use the overall probabilities of being 25 or older and combine them with the major distributions. Let me think about that.For part a), I already have the answer as 20%. For parts b) and c), since I don't have the exact distribution between 25-29 and older than 29, I might need to make an assumption or find another way to express the probability. Maybe I can express the probabilities in terms of the given percentages and see if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the overall probability of being 25 or older and then use that to find the probabilities for being between 25-29 and older than 29. Let me try that.First, let's find the overall probability of being 25 or older. We know that 40% of the class is male, and 50% of them are 25 or older. So, that's 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2 or 20% of the class. For female students, 60% of the class is female, and 30% of them are 25 or older. So, that's 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18 or 18% of the class. Adding those together, the total probability of being 25 or older is 0.2 + 0.18 = 0.38 or 38%.Now, for major A, 60% are 25 or older, which is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30% of the class. For major B, it's 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12% of the class. For major C, it's 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 or 4% of the class. Adding those up gives 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.44 or 44%, which doesn't match the 38% we calculated earlier. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, I think I confused the overall probability with the major-specific probabilities. Let me try again.The overall probability of being 25 or older is 38%, as calculated before. Now, for major A, 60% are 25 or older, which is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30% of the class. Similarly, for major B, it's 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12%, and for major C, it's 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%. Adding those gives 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.44 or 44%, which is higher than the overall 38%. That doesn't make sense. There must be an error in my approach.Maybe I should consider that the probabilities of being 25 or older are conditional on the major, so I need to use conditional probabilities. Let me recall Bayes' theorem or something similar.Actually, I think I need to find the joint probabilities of being in a major and being 25 or older. Since the probabilities of being 25 or older vary by major, I can calculate the total probability by summing over all majors.So, total probability of being 25 or older = P(A) * P(>=25|A) + P(B) * P(>=25|B) + P(C) * P(>=25|C) = 0.5 * 0.6 + 0.3 * 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.44 or 44%. But earlier, I calculated it as 38% based on gender. This inconsistency suggests that there's a conflict in the given data.Wait, perhaps the probabilities of being 25 or older are independent of gender and major? Or maybe they are not. The problem states both the gender-based probabilities and major-based probabilities. So, perhaps I need to reconcile these.Let me think. If 40% of the class is male, and 50% of them are 25 or older, that's 20% of the class. Similarly, 60% female, 30% of them are 25 or older, which is 18% of the class. So, total 38% are 25 or older based on gender.But based on major, it's 44%. These two should be consistent, but they're not. That suggests that the probabilities are not independent, and perhaps the major distribution varies by gender. Maybe I need to consider that.Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the major distribution is the same for males and females. It just says the overall distribution is 50% A, 30% B, 20% C. So, perhaps the major distribution is the same for both genders. Let me assume that.So, if 40% are male, and 50% of the class is major A, then 40% of the class are male, and 50% of those are major A, so 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2 or 20% of the class are male major A students. Similarly, 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12 or 12% are male major B, and 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 or 8% are male major C.For females, 60% of the class, so 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3 or 30% are female major A, 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18 or 18% are female major B, and 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12 or 12% are female major C.Now, for each group, we can calculate the number of students 25 or older.For male major A: 0.2 of the class, 50% are 25 or older, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the class.Male major B: 0.12 of the class, 50% are 25 or older, so 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06 or 6% of the class.Male major C: 0.08 of the class, 50% are 25 or older, so 0.08 * 0.5 = 0.04 or 4% of the class.For female major A: 0.3 of the class, 30% are 25 or older, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 or 9% of the class.Female major B: 0.18 of the class, 30% are 25 or older, so 0.18 * 0.3 = 0.054 or 5.4% of the class.Female major C: 0.12 of the class, 30% are 25 or older, so 0.12 * 0.3 = 0.036 or 3.6% of the class.Now, adding up all the 25 or older students:Male major A: 10%Male major B: 6%Male major C: 4%Female major A: 9%Female major B: 5.4%Female major C: 3.6%Total: 10 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 5.4 + 3.6 = 38%, which matches the earlier calculation based on gender. Good, so now the numbers are consistent.Now, for major A, the total number of students 25 or older is 10% (male) + 9% (female) = 19% of the class. But the problem states that 60% of major A students are 25 or older. Let's check: total major A students are 50%, so 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30% should be 25 or older. But according to our calculation, it's 19%, which is less than 30%. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.Wait, I think I see the issue. The problem states that 60% of major A students are 25 or older, regardless of gender. But in our calculation, considering gender-specific probabilities, we only get 19% of the class, which is less than 30%. So, there's a conflict.This suggests that the probabilities are not independent, and perhaps the major and gender are not independent variables. Maybe the major distribution varies by gender. The problem doesn't specify, so I'm making an assumption that the major distribution is the same for both genders, but that leads to inconsistency.Alternatively, maybe the probabilities of being 25 or older are conditional on both gender and major. So, perhaps I need to use the law of total probability, considering both gender and major.Let me try that. The total probability of being 25 or older is the sum over all genders and majors of P(gender) * P(major|gender) * P(>=25|gender, major).But the problem doesn't specify P(major|gender), only the overall P(major). So, unless the major distribution is the same for both genders, I can't proceed. But as we saw, that leads to inconsistency.Alternatively, maybe the major distribution is independent of gender, so P(major|gender) = P(major). Then, P(>=25) = sum over genders and majors of P(gender) * P(major) * P(>=25|gender, major).But the problem states P(>=25|gender) and P(>=25|major), not P(>=25|gender, major). So, perhaps I need to reconcile these.Wait, maybe I can use the law of total probability to express P(>=25) in two ways: one based on gender and one based on major, and see if they match.From gender: P(>=25) = P(male) * P(>=25|male) + P(female) * P(>=25|female) = 0.4 * 0.5 + 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.2 + 0.18 = 0.38 or 38%.From major: P(>=25) = P(A) * P(>=25|A) + P(B) * P(>=25|B) + P(C) * P(>=25|C) = 0.5 * 0.6 + 0.3 * 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.44 or 44%.These two should be equal, but they're not. That suggests that the probabilities are not independent, and there's a dependence between gender and major that we're not accounting for.Given that, perhaps the problem assumes that the major distribution is the same for both genders, and the probabilities of being 25 or older are conditional on both gender and major. But since we don't have that information, we might need to make an assumption.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the gender-based probabilities and only use the major-based probabilities, or vice versa. But that would be inconsistent with the given data.Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the probabilities are independent, and the discrepancy is due to rounding or approximation. Let me check.If I assume that the total probability of being 25 or older is 38%, and based on major it's 44%, the difference is 6%. Maybe that's due to rounding, but it's a significant difference. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the major-based probabilities regardless of the gender-based ones.Given that, maybe I should proceed with the major-based probabilities for parts b) and c), even though there's inconsistency.So, for part a), I already have the answer as 20%.For part b), being between 25 and 29 and studying major B. Since the problem only gives the probability of being 25 or older, which is 40% for major B, I need to find the probability of being between 25-29. If I assume that the 40% includes all ages 25 and older, and we need to find the probability of being between 25-29, I might need to make an assumption about the distribution.Perhaps I can assume that the ages are uniformly distributed beyond 25, but that's a strong assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that being 25 or older includes being between 25-29 and older than 29, but without specific data, I can't split it.Given that, maybe the problem expects us to use the major-based probability of being 25 or older as the probability for being between 25-29, which would be 40% for major B. But that would be incorrect because being 25 or older includes more than just 25-29.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that being between 25-29 is the same as being 25 or older, which would be incorrect. I'm not sure.Similarly, for part c), being older than 29 and studying major C, the problem only gives the probability of being 25 or older as 20%. So, again, without knowing how many are older than 29, I can't calculate it.Given the inconsistency in the probabilities and the lack of specific age distribution data, I think the problem might be expecting us to use the major-based probabilities for parts b) and c), even though it's not entirely accurate.So, for part b), the probability of studying major B is 30%, and the probability of being 25 or older is 40%. If I assume that being between 25-29 is the same as being 25 or older, then the probability would be 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12%. But that's not accurate because being 25 or older includes older than 29 as well.Similarly, for part c), the probability of studying major C is 20%, and the probability of being 25 or older is 20%. So, 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%. But again, that's not accurate because being 25 or older includes being between 25-29 and older than 29.Given that, I think the problem might be expecting us to use the major-based probabilities for parts b) and c), even though it's not entirely correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that being between 25-29 is the same as being 25 or older, which would be incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the overall probability of being 25 or older, which is 38%, and then use the major-based probabilities to find the probabilities for each major.So, for part b), the probability of being in major B and 25 or older is 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12%. But since the overall probability of being 25 or older is 38%, the probability of being in major B and 25 or older is 12%, which is part of the 38%. So, the probability of being between 25-29 and in major B would be less than 12%, but without knowing the exact distribution, I can't find it.Similarly, for part c), the probability of being in major C and 25 or older is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%, which is part of the 38%. So, the probability of being older than 29 and in major C would be less than 4%, but again, without knowing the exact distribution, I can't find it.Given all this, I think the problem might be expecting us to use the major-based probabilities for parts b) and c), even though it's not entirely accurate. So, for part b), 30% studying major B, 40% of them are 25 or older, so 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12%. For part c), 20% studying major C, 20% of them are 25 or older, so 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%.But I'm not entirely confident about this approach because it ignores the gender-based probabilities and assumes that the major-based probabilities are independent, which might not be the case. However, given the information provided, this seems like the only way to proceed.So, to summarize:a) Less than 25 and major A: 20%b) Between 25-29 and major B: 12%c) Older than 29 and major C: 4%But I'm aware that this might not be entirely accurate due to the inconsistencies in the given probabilities."},{"question":"(1)left(2m+nright)^{2}-left(4m+3nright)left(m-nright);  (2)[frac{(2x+1)(3x-4)}{2{x}^{2}-5x-3}-1]÷frac{4{x}^{2}-1}{x-3}.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two algebra problems to solve.

Hmm, I remember that expanding expressions like this involves using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials. Let me recall how that works.First, I'll tackle the (2m + n) squared part. Using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², I can expand this.So, (2m)² is 4m², right? Then, 2 times 2m times n is 4mn, and finally, n squared is n². So putting it all together, (2m + n)² should be 4m² + 4mn + n².Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second part: (4m + 3n)(m - n). This is a product of two binomials, so I can use the distributive property here as well.Let me distribute each term in the first binomial to each term in the second binomial. So, 4m times m is 4m², 4m times (-n) is -4mn, 3n times m is 3mn, and 3n times (-n) is -3n². Putting that all together: 4m² - 4mn + 3mn - 3n². Now, I can combine like terms here. The -4mn and +3mn combine to -1mn, so the expression simplifies to 4m² - mn - 3n².Alright, so now I have both parts expanded. The original expression is (2m + n)² minus (4m + 3n)(m - n), which translates to:(4m² + 4mn + n²) - (4m² - mn - 3n²)I need to subtract the second expanded expression from the first one. Let me distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses:4m² + 4mn + n² - 4m² + mn + 3n²Now, let's combine like terms:- The 4m² and -4m² cancel each other out.- The 4mn and +mn combine to 5mn.- The n² and +3n² combine to 4n².So, after simplifying, the expression becomes 5mn + 4n².Wait, let me double-check that. Did I combine the terms correctly?Starting again:4m² + 4mn + n² - 4m² + mn + 3n²Yes, 4m² - 4m² is 0.4mn + mn is 5mn.n² + 3n² is 4n².So, yes, 5mn + 4n² is correct.Hmm, but I just realized that in the original problem, it's (2m + n)² minus (4m + 3n)(m - n). Did I subtract correctly?Yes, I think so. I expanded both parts and then subtracted the second expansion from the first. The terms seem to cancel out correctly.Wait, another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in expanding (4m + 3n)(m - n). Let me check that again.(4m + 3n)(m - n) = 4m * m + 4m * (-n) + 3n * m + 3n * (-n)Which is 4m² - 4mn + 3mn - 3n².Yes, that's correct. So, combining -4mn + 3mn gives -mn, not -1mn. So, that part is correct.Therefore, the final simplified expression is 5mn + 4n².Wait, but in the initial expansion, I had 4m² + 4mn + n² minus 4m² - mn - 3n², which simplifies to 5mn + 4n². So, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me plug in some numbers to test it.Let's say m = 1 and n = 1.Original expression: (2*1 + 1)² - (4*1 + 3*1)(1 - 1) = (3)² - (7)(0) = 9 - 0 = 9.Simplified expression: 5*1*1 + 4*1² = 5 + 4 = 9.Okay, it matches. Let's try another set of numbers: m = 2, n = 3.Original expression: (4 + 3)² - (8 + 9)(2 - 3) = 49 - (17)(-1) = 49 + 17 = 66.Simplified expression: 5*2*3 + 4*9 = 30 + 36 = 66.Perfect, it matches again. So, I'm confident that the simplified expression is 5mn + 4n².Wait a second, in my initial calculation, I got 5mn + 4n², but in the thought process, I thought of 8mn + 4n². Did I make a mistake somewhere?Wait, let me go back.Original expansion:(2m + n)² = 4m² + 4mn + n².(4m + 3n)(m - n) = 4m² - 4mn + 3mn - 3n² = 4m² - mn - 3n².Subtracting the second from the first:4m² + 4mn + n² - (4m² - mn - 3n²) = 4m² + 4mn + n² - 4m² + mn + 3n².Now, combining like terms:4m² - 4m² = 0.4mn + mn = 5mn.n² + 3n² = 4n².So, total is 5mn + 4n².Wait, so why did I initially think of 8mn + 4n²? Maybe I miscalculated somewhere.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction step. Let me check again.Original expression: (2m + n)² - (4m + 3n)(m - n).Which is (4m² + 4mn + n²) - (4m² - mn - 3n²).So, distributing the negative sign:4m² + 4mn + n² - 4m² + mn + 3n².Yes, that's correct.So, 4m² - 4m² cancels out.4mn + mn = 5mn.n² + 3n² = 4n².So, indeed, it's 5mn + 4n².But wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote:\\"Problem 1: Simplify (2m + n)² - (4m + 3n)(m - n).\\"And in the solution, they wrote:\\"First, expand (2m + n)^2: (2m + n)^2 = 4m² + 4mn + n².Next, expand (4m + 3n)(m - n): (4m + 3n)(m - n) = 4m² - 4mn - 3n².Subtract the second expansion from the first: 4m² + 4mn + n² - (4m² - 4mn - 3n²) = 4m² + 4mn + n² - 4m² + 4mn + 3n².Combine like terms: = 8mn + 4n².\\"Wait, so in their solution, they have 8mn + 4n², but according to my calculation, it's 5mn + 4n².Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check their expansion of (4m + 3n)(m - n).They wrote: (4m + 3n)(m - n) = 4m² - 4mn - 3n².But when I expanded it, I got 4m² - mn - 3n².Wait, that's different. So, where is the mistake?Let me redo the expansion:(4m + 3n)(m - n) = 4m * m + 4m * (-n) + 3n * m + 3n * (-n).Which is 4m² - 4mn + 3mn - 3n².Combine like terms: -4mn + 3mn = -mn.So, the correct expansion is 4m² - mn - 3n².But in the solution, they have 4m² - 4mn - 3n².So, they incorrectly combined -4mn and +3mn as -4mn instead of -mn.That's a mistake.Therefore, their subtraction step is incorrect.So, the correct simplified expression is 5mn + 4n², not 8mn + 4n².But in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"Problem 1: Simplify (2m + n)² - (4m + 3n)(m - n).\\"And in their solution, they got 8mn + 4n², which is incorrect.So, I need to correct that.Therefore, the correct simplified expression is 5mn + 4n².Wait, but in my initial calculation, I got 5mn + 4n², and when I tested with m=1, n=1, it matched. Similarly, with m=2, n=3, it matched.So, I think the correct answer is 5mn + 4n².But the user's solution has 8mn + 4n², which is wrong.So, I need to make sure that in my final answer, I present the correct simplified expression.Alright, moving on to Problem 2.**Problem 2: Simplify [(2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3) - 1] ÷ (4x² - 1)/(x - 3).**Okay, this looks a bit more complicated. It's a complex fraction involving division and subtraction. Let me break it down step by step.First, let's look at the numerator of the main fraction: [(2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3) - 1].I need to simplify this part first before dealing with the division by (4x² - 1)/(x - 3).Let me start by simplifying the fraction (2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3).I notice that the denominator is a quadratic: 2x² - 5x - 3. Maybe it can be factored.Let me try factoring 2x² - 5x - 3.Looking for two numbers that multiply to (2 * -3) = -6 and add up to -5.Hmm, factors of -6 are: 1 and -6, 2 and -3.Looking for a pair that adds to -5. 1 and -6 add to -5. Yes, that's it.So, we can write 2x² - 5x - 3 as 2x² + x - 6x - 3.Grouping terms:(2x² + x) + (-6x - 3) = x(2x + 1) - 3(2x + 1) = (x - 3)(2x + 1).So, 2x² - 5x - 3 factors to (x - 3)(2x + 1).Therefore, the fraction (2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3) simplifies to (2x + 1)(3x - 4)/[(x - 3)(2x + 1)].I notice that (2x + 1) cancels out from numerator and denominator, provided that 2x + 1 ≠ 0, so x ≠ -1/2.So, the fraction simplifies to (3x - 4)/(x - 3).Now, the numerator of the main fraction is [(3x - 4)/(x - 3) - 1].Let me write 1 as (x - 3)/(x - 3) to have a common denominator.So, [(3x - 4)/(x - 3) - (x - 3)/(x - 3)] = [ (3x - 4) - (x - 3) ] / (x - 3).Simplify the numerator:3x - 4 - x + 3 = (3x - x) + (-4 + 3) = 2x - 1.So, the numerator simplifies to (2x - 1)/(x - 3).Now, the entire expression is [(2x - 1)/(x - 3)] ÷ [(4x² - 1)/(x - 3)].Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.So, [(2x - 1)/(x - 3)] * [(x - 3)/(4x² - 1)].I notice that (x - 3) cancels out from numerator and denominator, provided that x ≠ 3.So, we're left with (2x - 1)/(4x² - 1).Now, let's factor the denominator 4x² - 1. It's a difference of squares, so it factors to (2x - 1)(2x + 1).So, the expression becomes (2x - 1)/[(2x - 1)(2x + 1)].Again, (2x - 1) cancels out, provided that 2x - 1 ≠ 0, so x ≠ 1/2.Therefore, the simplified expression is 1/(2x + 1).Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Factored the denominator 2x² - 5x - 3 correctly to (x - 3)(2x + 1). Yes.2. Cancelled (2x + 1) in the numerator and denominator. Correct.3. Subtracted 1 by expressing it as (x - 3)/(x - 3). Correct.4. Simplified the numerator to (2x - 1)/(x - 3). Correct.5. Divided by (4x² - 1)/(x - 3) by multiplying by its reciprocal. Correct.6. Cancelled (x - 3). Correct.7. Factored 4x² - 1 as (2x - 1)(2x + 1). Correct.8. Cancelled (2x - 1). Correct.9. Final result: 1/(2x + 1). Correct.To be thorough, let me test with a value of x, say x = 2.Original expression:[(2*2 + 1)(3*2 - 4)/(2*(2)^2 - 5*2 - 3) - 1] ÷ (4*(2)^2 - 1)/(2 - 3).Calculate step by step:Numerator part:(5)(2)/(8 - 10 - 3) - 1 = (10)/(-5) - 1 = -2 - 1 = -3.Denominator part:(16 - 1)/(-1) = 15/-1 = -15.So, the entire expression is (-3)/(-15) = 1/5.Simplified expression: 1/(2*2 + 1) = 1/5.It matches. Let's try another value, x = 0.Original expression:[(1)(-4)/(0 - 0 - 3) - 1] ÷ (0 - 1)/(-3).Numerator part:(1)(-4)/(-3) - 1 = (4/3) - 1 = 1/3.Denominator part:(-1)/(-3) = 1/3.So, the entire expression is (1/3)/(1/3) = 1.Simplified expression: 1/(0 + 1) = 1.It matches. Another test: x = 1.Original expression:[(3)(-1)/(2 - 5 - 3) - 1] ÷ (4 - 1)/(-2).Numerator part:(3)(-1)/(-6) - 1 = (3/6) - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5.Denominator part:3/(-2) = -1.5.So, the entire expression is (-0.5)/(-1.5) = 1/3.Simplified expression: 1/(2*1 + 1) = 1/3.It matches.Therefore, I'm confident that the simplified expression is 1/(2x + 1).Wait, but in the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"Problem 2: Simplify [(2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3) - 1] ÷ (4x² - 1)/(x - 3).\\"And in their solution, they wrote:\\"Factor the denominator of the first fraction and simplify the expression: [(2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x + 1)(x - 3) - 1] * (x - 3)/(2x + 1)(2x - 1).Simplify the fraction by canceling (2x + 1): = (3x - 4 - (x - 3))/(x - 3) * (x - 3)/(2x + 1)(2x - 1).Simplify the numerator: = (2x - 1)/(x - 3) * (x - 3)/(2x + 1)(2x - 1).Cancel (x - 3): = 1/(2x + 1).\\"So, their solution is correct, and they arrived at 1/(2x + 1).Therefore, both problems have been correctly solved.But wait, in Problem 1, I initially thought the user's solution was incorrect because they had 8mn + 4n², but upon re-examining, I realized that their expansion of (4m + 3n)(m - n) was incorrect, leading to an incorrect subtraction.But in my own calculation, I got 5mn + 4n², which is correct.So, to summarize:Problem 1: Simplify (2m + n)² - (4m + 3n)(m - n).Correct simplified expression: 5mn + 4n².Problem 2: Simplify [(2x + 1)(3x - 4)/(2x² - 5x - 3) - 1] ÷ (4x² - 1)/(x - 3).Correct simplified expression: 1/(2x + 1).I think that's all. I've double-checked my work, tested with specific values, and everything seems to align correctly. I feel confident about these solutions now."},{"question":"The negation of the proposition \\"If a number is negative, then its square is positive\\" is ______ proposition. (Fill in true or false)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The negation of the proposition 'If a number is negative, then its square is positive' is ______ proposition. (Fill in true or false).\\" Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what the original proposition is saying. It's a conditional statement: \\"If a number is negative, then its square is positive.\\" In logical terms, this can be written as P → Q, where P is \\"a number is negative\\" and Q is \\"its square is positive.\\"Now, the question is asking about the negation of this proposition. So, I need to figure out what the negation of P → Q is. From what I remember in logic, the negation of a conditional statement P → Q is not simply another conditional statement. Instead, it's equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q. That means, \\"P and not Q.\\" So, in this context, the negation would be: \\"A number is negative, and its square is not positive.\\"Wait, let me make sure I'm recalling this correctly. The original statement is P → Q, which is logically equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q. So, the negation would be ¬(¬P ∨ Q), which by De Morgan's laws becomes P ∧ ¬Q. Yeah, that seems right. So, the negation is indeed \\"A number is negative, and its square is not positive.\\"Now, I need to determine if this negation is a true or false proposition. To do that, I should analyze whether there exists any number that is negative but whose square is not positive.Let's think about squares of negative numbers. If I take any negative number, say -2, and square it, I get (-2)² = 4, which is positive. Similarly, (-3)² = 9, which is also positive. In fact, for any real number, squaring it results in a non-negative number. So, the square of a negative number is always positive.Therefore, the statement \\"A number is negative, and its square is not positive\\" would require that there exists a negative number whose square is not positive. But as we've just seen, this is impossible because the square of any negative number is positive. Hence, there is no such number.This means that the negation of the original proposition is always false. So, the negation is a false proposition.Wait a second, let me double-check my reasoning. If the original statement is always true, then its negation should always be false. Is the original statement always true? Let's see: \\"If a number is negative, then its square is positive.\\" As I thought earlier, squaring any negative number gives a positive result. So, yes, the original statement is always true.Therefore, its negation must be always false. So, the negation is a false proposition.I think that's solid. I don't see any flaws in my reasoning. The key points are understanding how to negate a conditional statement and then applying that to the specific case of negative numbers and their squares."},{"question":"Haley's mom was buying extra school supplies for Haley and her sister. She bought some reams of paper for Haley and 3 reams for her sister. She bought a total of 5 reams of paper. How many reams of paper did she buy for Haley?","answer":"Okay, let's see. So, the problem is about Haley's mom buying reams of paper for both Haley and her sister. She bought some reams for Haley and 3 reams for her sister, and altogether, she bought 5 reams. The question is asking how many reams she bought for Haley.Alright, so first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's a simple subtraction problem, right? If the total number of reams is 5, and 3 of them are for the sister, then the remaining should be for Haley. So, I think it's just 5 minus 3.But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, these problems can have tricks or additional steps. Is there any chance that the \\"some reams\\" for Haley could mean something more complicated, like a fraction or a multiple? Hmm, the problem says \\"some reams,\\" which is pretty vague, but since the total is 5 and the sister got 3, it's likely a straightforward subtraction.Let me visualize this. Imagine there are 5 reams in total. Out of these, 3 are set aside for the sister. So, how many are left for Haley? If I take away 3 from 5, I should get the number for Haley.So, 5 minus 3 equals 2. That seems right. But just to double-check, if Haley's mom bought 2 reams for Haley and 3 for her sister, adding them together gives 5, which matches the total given in the problem. Yep, that makes sense.I don't think there's anything else to it. It's a basic subtraction problem without any hidden complexities. So, the answer should be 2 reams for Haley."},{"question":"Show that the function y satisfies equation (1).begin{aligned}& y=(x+1)^{n} cdot left(e^{x}-1right) & y^{prime} - frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = e^{x}(1+x)^{n}end{aligned}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that the function ( y = (x+1)^n cdot (e^x - 1) ) satisfies the differential equation ( y' - frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = e^x (1 + x)^n ). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that to show a function satisfies a differential equation, I need to compute the derivative of the function and then plug it back into the equation to see if both sides are equal. So, let's start by finding the derivative ( y' ).Given ( y = (x+1)^n cdot (e^x - 1) ), I can see that this is a product of two functions: ( u = (x+1)^n ) and ( v = e^x - 1 ). To find ( y' ), I should use the product rule, which states that ( (uv)' = u'v + uv' ).Let's compute ( u' ) and ( v' ) separately.For ( u = (x+1)^n ), the derivative ( u' ) with respect to ( x ) is ( n(x+1)^{n-1} ). That's straightforward using the power rule.For ( v = e^x - 1 ), the derivative ( v' ) with respect to ( x ) is ( e^x ), since the derivative of ( e^x ) is itself and the derivative of 1 is 0.Now, applying the product rule:( y' = u'v + uv' = n(x+1)^{n-1} cdot (e^x - 1) + (x+1)^n cdot e^x ).Okay, so that's ( y' ). Now, I need to substitute ( y' ) and ( y ) into the given differential equation ( y' - frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = e^x (1 + x)^n ).Let me write down ( y' ) and ( y ):( y' = n(x+1)^{n-1}(e^x - 1) + (x+1)^n e^x )( y = (x+1)^n (e^x - 1) )Now, let's compute ( frac{n cdot y}{x+1} ):( frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = frac{n cdot (x+1)^n (e^x - 1)}{x+1} )Simplifying this, ( (x+1)^n ) divided by ( x+1 ) is ( (x+1)^{n-1} ), so:( frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = n(x+1)^{n-1}(e^x - 1) )Now, let's substitute ( y' ) and ( frac{n cdot y}{x+1} ) into the left side of the differential equation:( y' - frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = [n(x+1)^{n-1}(e^x - 1) + (x+1)^n e^x] - [n(x+1)^{n-1}(e^x - 1)] )Looking at this, the ( n(x+1)^{n-1}(e^x - 1) ) terms cancel out, leaving us with:( y' - frac{n cdot y}{x+1} = (x+1)^n e^x )But the right side of the differential equation is ( e^x (1 + x)^n ), which is the same as ( (x+1)^n e^x ). So, both sides are equal.Therefore, the function ( y = (x+1)^n cdot (e^x - 1) ) satisfies the given differential equation.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I computed ( y' ) using the product rule correctly, substituted both ( y' ) and ( y ) into the equation, and the terms canceled out as expected. The final expression matches the right side of the equation. Yeah, I think this is correct.Just to be thorough, maybe I can plug in a specific value of ( x ) and ( n ) to test. Let's choose ( n = 1 ) and ( x = 0 ).For ( n = 1 ) and ( x = 0 ):( y = (0+1)^1 cdot (e^0 - 1) = 1 cdot (1 - 1) = 0 )( y' = 1 cdot (e^0 - 1) + (0+1)^1 cdot e^0 = 1 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 1 = 1 )Now, the left side of the differential equation:( y' - frac{1 cdot y}{0+1} = 1 - frac{1 cdot 0}{1} = 1 - 0 = 1 )The right side:( e^0 (1 + 0)^1 = 1 cdot 1 = 1 )They match. Let's try another point, say ( x = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ).( y = (1+1)^2 cdot (e^1 - 1) = 4 cdot (e - 1) )( y' = 2(1+1)^{1} cdot (e - 1) + (1+1)^2 cdot e = 2 cdot 2 cdot (e - 1) + 4e = 4(e - 1) + 4e = 4e - 4 + 4e = 8e - 4 )Left side:( y' - frac{2 cdot y}{1+1} = (8e - 4) - frac{2 cdot 4(e - 1)}{2} = 8e - 4 - 4(e - 1) = 8e - 4 - 4e + 4 = 4e )Right side:( e^1 (1 + 1)^2 = e cdot 4 = 4e )Again, they match. Okay, so my calculations seem correct. I think I've successfully shown that the function satisfies the differential equation."},{"question":"Given that the central angle of a sector is frac{3}{2} radians, and its radius is 6 cm, then the arc length of the sector is ______ cm, and the area of the sector is ______ cm<sup>2</sup>.","answer":"To determine the arc length and area of the sector, I will use the given central angle and radius.First, for the arc length (l), the formula is:[ l = theta times r ]where (theta) is the central angle in radians and (r) is the radius.Plugging in the values:[ l = frac{3}{2} times 6 = 9 text{ cm} ]Next, for the area (S) of the sector, the formula is:[ S = frac{1}{2} times l times r ]Using the previously calculated arc length:[ S = frac{1}{2} times 9 times 6 = 27 text{ cm}^2 ]Therefore, the arc length is 9 cm and the area of the sector is 27 cm²."},{"question":"( p(x) ) is a real polynomial of degree less than 3 and satisfies ( |p(x)| leq 1 ) for ( x in [-1, 1] ). Show that ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ) for ( x in [-1, 1] ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that if ( p(x) ) is a real polynomial of degree less than 3 and satisfies ( |p(x)| leq 1 ) for ( x in [-1, 1] ), then ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ) for ( x in [-1, 1] ). Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.First, since ( p(x) ) is a polynomial of degree less than 3, it can be written as ( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are real coefficients. The derivative of this polynomial would be ( p'(x) = 2ax + b ). So, our goal is to show that the absolute value of ( 2ax + b ) is at most 4 for all ( x ) in the interval ([-1, 1]).Given that ( |p(x)| leq 1 ) on ([-1, 1]), this means that the polynomial doesn't exceed 1 or go below -1 in that interval. I think this constraint should help us bound the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ), which in turn will help us bound the derivative.Let me consider evaluating ( p(x) ) at specific points in the interval ([-1, 1]). Maybe evaluating at ( x = -1 ), ( x = 0 ), and ( x = 1 ) will give me some useful equations or inequalities.At ( x = 0 ), ( p(0) = c ). Since ( |p(0)| leq 1 ), this tells me that ( |c| leq 1 ). So, ( c ) is between -1 and 1.At ( x = 1 ), ( p(1) = a + b + c ). The absolute value of this is also at most 1, so ( |a + b + c| leq 1 ).Similarly, at ( x = -1 ), ( p(-1) = a - b + c ). Again, ( |a - b + c| leq 1 ).Now, I have three inequalities:1. ( |c| leq 1 )2. ( |a + b + c| leq 1 )3. ( |a - b + c| leq 1 )I need to use these to find bounds on ( a ) and ( b ) so that I can bound ( p'(x) = 2ax + b ).Let me think about how to combine these inequalities. Maybe I can add and subtract them to eliminate some variables.If I add the second and third inequalities, I get:( |a + b + c| + |a - b + c| leq 2 )But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe instead, I can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( p(1) ), ( p(-1) ), and ( p(0) ).Let me denote ( p(1) = A ), ( p(-1) = B ), and ( p(0) = C ). So, we have:1. ( C = c )2. ( A = a + b + c )3. ( B = a - b + c )From these, I can solve for ( a ) and ( b ). Let's subtract equation 3 from equation 2:( A - B = (a + b + c) - (a - b + c) = 2b )So, ( b = frac{A - B}{2} )Similarly, adding equations 2 and 3:( A + B = (a + b + c) + (a - b + c) = 2a + 2c )So, ( 2a = A + B - 2c ), which gives ( a = frac{A + B - 2c}{2} )Now, since ( |A| leq 1 ), ( |B| leq 1 ), and ( |C| = |c| leq 1 ), I can write:( |a| = left| frac{A + B - 2c}{2} right| leq frac{|A| + |B| + 2|c|}{2} leq frac{1 + 1 + 2(1)}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 )So, ( |a| leq 2 )Similarly, for ( |b| ):( |b| = left| frac{A - B}{2} right| leq frac{|A| + |B|}{2} leq frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 )So, ( |b| leq 1 )Now, knowing that ( |a| leq 2 ) and ( |b| leq 1 ), let's look at the derivative ( p'(x) = 2ax + b ).We need to find the maximum of ( |2ax + b| ) over ( x in [-1, 1] ). Since ( x ) can be between -1 and 1, let's consider the maximum possible values of ( 2ax + b ).The expression ( 2ax + b ) is linear in ( x ), so its maximum absolute value on the interval ([-1, 1]) occurs at one of the endpoints, i.e., at ( x = -1 ) or ( x = 1 ).Let's compute ( p'(1) = 2a(1) + b = 2a + b ) and ( p'(-1) = 2a(-1) + b = -2a + b ).So, we need to bound ( |2a + b| ) and ( |-2a + b| ).Given that ( |a| leq 2 ) and ( |b| leq 1 ), let's compute the maximum possible values of these expressions.For ( |2a + b| ):The maximum occurs when ( a ) and ( b ) are both positive or both negative. Since ( |a| leq 2 ) and ( |b| leq 1 ), the maximum value of ( 2a + b ) is ( 2(2) + 1 = 5 ), and the minimum is ( -2(2) - 1 = -5 ). So, ( |2a + b| leq 5 ).Wait, but the problem states that ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ). Hmm, so my initial bound is 5, which is larger than 4. That suggests that my approach might not be tight enough.Maybe I need a better way to bound ( |2a + b| ) and ( |-2a + b| ). Perhaps instead of using the individual bounds on ( a ) and ( b ), I can use the relationships between ( a ), ( b ), and the values of ( p(x) ) at specific points.Earlier, I expressed ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Let me revisit that.We had:( a = frac{A + B - 2C}{2} )( b = frac{A - B}{2} )So, let's substitute these into ( 2a + b ):( 2a + b = 2left( frac{A + B - 2C}{2} right) + frac{A - B}{2} = (A + B - 2C) + frac{A - B}{2} = frac{2A + 2B - 4C + A - B}{2} = frac{3A + B - 4C}{2} )Similarly, ( -2a + b = -2left( frac{A + B - 2C}{2} right) + frac{A - B}{2} = -(A + B - 2C) + frac{A - B}{2} = -A - B + 2C + frac{A - B}{2} = frac{-2A - 2B + 4C + A - B}{2} = frac{-A - 3B + 4C}{2} )So, ( |2a + b| = left| frac{3A + B - 4C}{2} right| ) and ( |-2a + b| = left| frac{-A - 3B + 4C}{2} right| )Since ( |A| leq 1 ), ( |B| leq 1 ), and ( |C| leq 1 ), let's compute the maximum possible values of these expressions.For ( |2a + b| ):( left| frac{3A + B - 4C}{2} right| leq frac{3|A| + |B| + 4|C|}{2} leq frac{3(1) + 1 + 4(1)}{2} = frac{3 + 1 + 4}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4 )Similarly, for ( |-2a + b| ):( left| frac{-A - 3B + 4C}{2} right| leq frac{|A| + 3|B| + 4|C|}{2} leq frac{1 + 3(1) + 4(1)}{2} = frac{1 + 3 + 4}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4 )So, both ( |2a + b| ) and ( |-2a + b| ) are bounded by 4. Therefore, the maximum value of ( |p'(x)| ) on the interval ([-1, 1]) is at most 4.Wait, but earlier when I bounded ( |a| ) and ( |b| ) individually, I got a higher bound of 5. So, using the expressions in terms of ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) gives a tighter bound. That makes sense because the relationships between ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are more constrained by the values of ( p(x) ) at specific points.Therefore, combining these results, we can conclude that ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ) for all ( x in [-1, 1] ).I think this approach works because it directly relates the coefficients to the values of the polynomial at specific points, which are bounded by 1. By expressing the derivative in terms of these bounded values, we can find a tighter bound on the derivative itself.Just to double-check, let's consider an example polynomial that achieves the bound. For instance, take ( p(x) = 2x^2 - 1 ). Then, ( p'(x) = 4x ). On the interval ([-1, 1]), the maximum derivative is 4 at ( x = 1 ) and -4 at ( x = -1 ). So, ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ) is indeed achieved.Another example: ( p(x) = 2x ). Then, ( p'(x) = 2 ), which is less than 4. Wait, but ( p(x) = 2x ) doesn't satisfy ( |p(x)| leq 1 ) on ([-1, 1]) because at ( x = 1 ), ( p(1) = 2 ), which is greater than 1. So, that's not a valid example.Let me think of another example. Suppose ( p(x) = x^2 ). Then, ( p'(x) = 2x ), which has a maximum absolute value of 2 on ([-1, 1]). So, that's within the bound.Wait, but the first example I had, ( p(x) = 2x^2 - 1 ), does satisfy ( |p(x)| leq 1 ) on ([-1, 1]) because ( 2x^2 ) ranges from 0 to 2, so subtracting 1 gives a range from -1 to 1. So, that's a valid example where the derivative reaches 4.Therefore, the bound is tight, and the maximum derivative is indeed 4.I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked with examples to ensure the reasoning is sound. So, the conclusion is that ( |p'(x)| leq 4 ) for all ( x in [-1, 1] )."},{"question":"In the diagram, ( UVWX ) is a rectangle that lies flat on a horizontal floor.

There's a vertical semi-circular wall constructed with diameter XW, and point Z is the highest point on this wall. They give me the lengths UV = 20 and VW = 30, and I need to find the perimeter of triangle UVZ. The options are 95, 86, 102, 83, and 92. Hmm, okay.First, let me visualize the problem. There's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. So, UV = WX = 20, and VW = UX = 30. The semi-circular wall is built on diameter XW, which is 20 units long. Point Z is the highest point on this semi-circle, so it should be directly above the center of XW.Let me draw this out mentally. The rectangle is on the floor, with UV and WX as the shorter sides (20 units) and VW and UX as the longer sides (30 units). The semi-circle is standing vertically on the side XW, so it's like a half-cylinder attached to the rectangle. Point Z is at the top of this semi-circle.Now, I need to find the perimeter of triangle UVZ. That means I need the lengths of sides UV, UZ, and VZ. I already know UV is 20, so I just need to find UZ and VZ.Since Z is the highest point on the semi-circle, it's directly above the midpoint of XW. Let me call the midpoint O. So, O is the center of the semi-circle, and ZO is the radius, which is half of XW. Since XW is 20, the radius is 10. So, ZO = 10.Now, let's think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates will help me figure out the distances. Let me place point U at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since UV is 20, point V would be at (20,0,0). VW is 30, so moving up from V, point W would be at (20,30,0). Then, point X would be at (0,30,0), completing the rectangle.The semi-circle is constructed on XW, which is from (0,30,0) to (20,30,0). The midpoint O is at (10,30,0). Since the semi-circle is vertical, point Z is directly above O at (10,30,10), because the radius is 10.Now, I need to find the distances UZ and VZ. Let's start with UZ. Point U is at (0,0,0), and point Z is at (10,30,10). The distance between two points in 3D space is given by the formula:[ text{Distance} = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} ]So, applying this to UZ:[ UZ = sqrt{(10 - 0)^2 + (30 - 0)^2 + (10 - 0)^2} ][ UZ = sqrt{10^2 + 30^2 + 10^2} ][ UZ = sqrt{100 + 900 + 100} ][ UZ = sqrt{1100} ]Similarly, let's find VZ. Point V is at (20,0,0), and point Z is at (10,30,10).[ VZ = sqrt{(10 - 20)^2 + (30 - 0)^2 + (10 - 0)^2} ][ VZ = sqrt{(-10)^2 + 30^2 + 10^2} ][ VZ = sqrt{100 + 900 + 100} ][ VZ = sqrt{1100} ]So, both UZ and VZ are equal to √1100. Let me calculate that. √100 is 10, √121 is 11, so √1100 is somewhere between 33 and 34. Let me compute it more accurately.1100 divided by 100 is 11, so √1100 = √(100*11) = 10√11. √11 is approximately 3.3166, so 10*3.3166 is approximately 33.166. So, each of UZ and VZ is approximately 33.166.Now, the perimeter of triangle UVZ is UV + UZ + VZ. UV is 20, and each of UZ and VZ is approximately 33.166.So, perimeter ≈ 20 + 33.166 + 33.166 = 20 + 66.332 = 86.332.Looking at the options, 86 is one of them, so the perimeter is closest to 86.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Coordinates: U at (0,0,0), V at (20,0,0), W at (20,30,0), X at (0,30,0). Midpoint O at (10,30,0). Point Z at (10,30,10). Then, distance from U to Z: √[(10)^2 + (30)^2 + (10)^2] = √(100 + 900 + 100) = √1100. Same for V to Z: √[(-10)^2 + (30)^2 + (10)^2] = √(100 + 900 + 100) = √1100. So, yes, that seems correct.Perimeter: 20 + 2*√1100 ≈ 20 + 2*33.166 ≈ 20 + 66.332 ≈ 86.332. So, 86 is the closest answer. So, I think option B, 86, is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"A square with integer side length is cut into 12 squares, all of which have integer side length, and at least 10 of which have area 4. What is the smallest possible value of the length of the side of the original square?text{(A)} 7text{(B)} 8text{(C)} 9text{(D)} 10text{(E)} 11","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a square being cut into 12 smaller squares, all with integer side lengths. At least 10 of these smaller squares have an area of 4, which means their side length is 2 because area is side squared, right? So, 2 squared is 4. First, I need to figure out the total area of the original square. Since it's cut into smaller squares, the total area of the original square should be equal to the sum of the areas of all the smaller squares. Let me break it down. If there are at least 10 squares with an area of 4, that means 10 times 4 is 40. So, the total area contributed by these 10 squares is 40. Now, there are 12 squares in total, so there are 2 more squares whose areas I don't know yet. Let's call their areas A and B. So, the total area of the original square would be 40 plus A plus B. Since all the smaller squares have integer side lengths, A and B must also be perfect squares. The smallest possible perfect squares after 4 are 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. But since we're looking for the smallest possible original square, I should try to keep A and B as small as possible. If I assume that A and B are both 1, then the total area would be 40 + 1 + 1 = 42. But 42 isn't a perfect square. The next perfect square after 42 is 49, which is 7 squared. So, if the original square has a side length of 7, its area would be 49. But 49 minus 40 is 9, which would mean that A and B together need to be 9. Since 9 can be broken down into 9 and 0, but 0 isn't a valid area for a square. Alternatively, 4 and 5, but 5 isn't a perfect square. Wait, that doesn't work. Maybe I need to consider that A and B can't both be 1. Let's try A = 4 and B = 4. Then, the total area would be 40 + 4 + 4 = 48. 48 isn't a perfect square either. The next perfect square after 48 is 49, which is 7 squared. But again, 49 minus 40 is 9, which doesn't fit with A and B being 4 and 4. Hmm, maybe I need to consider a larger original square. Let's try 8. 8 squared is 64. So, 64 minus 40 is 24. Now, A and B need to add up to 24. Let's see, 24 can be broken down into 16 and 8, but 8 isn't a perfect square. Or 9 and 15, but 15 isn't a perfect square. Wait, 16 is a perfect square, so if A is 16, then B would be 8, but 8 isn't a perfect square. That doesn't work. What if A is 9 and B is 15? No, 15 isn't a perfect square. Maybe A is 4 and B is 20? No, 20 isn't a perfect square. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that A and B can be different sizes. Let's think about it differently. If I have 10 squares of area 4, that's 10 squares of side length 2. So, each of these squares is 2x2. Now, I need to fit these 10 squares into the original square along with two more squares. The original square has to be big enough to accommodate all of these. Let me visualize this. If I have a square that's 8x8, that's 64 units of area. The 10 smaller squares take up 40 units, leaving 24 units for the other two squares. Maybe those two squares can be 3x3 each, which would be 9 units each. But 9 times 2 is 18, which is less than 24. So, that leaves some extra space. Alternatively, one could be 4x4 (16 units) and the other could be 8 units, but 8 isn't a perfect square. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the side lengths. If the original square is 8x8, can I fit 10 squares of 2x2 and two squares of 2x2? That would be 12 squares of 2x2, but the problem says at least 10, so that's possible. But wait, that would make all 12 squares of area 4, which is allowed, but the question is asking for the smallest possible original square. But if I use 10 squares of 2x2 and two squares of 2x2, that's 12 squares of 2x2, which would require the original square to be at least 4x4, but that's way too small. So, I must be missing something. Maybe the two additional squares can't both be 2x2 because that would require the original square to be larger. Let me try to fit 10 squares of 2x2 and two squares of 3x3. The total area would be 10*4 + 2*9 = 40 + 18 = 58. 58 isn't a perfect square. The next perfect square after 58 is 64, which is 8x8. So, if the original square is 8x8, the total area is 64. Then, 64 - 58 = 6. So, I need to account for 6 more units of area. Maybe one of the squares is 3x3 and the other is 2x2, but that would be 9 + 4 = 13, which is too much. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the sizes. If I have 10 squares of 2x2, that's 40. Then, I need two more squares that add up to 24. Let's see, 16 and 8, but 8 isn't a perfect square. 9 and 15, nope. 4 and 20, nope. Maybe 25 and -1, which doesn't make sense. Hmm. Perhaps I need to consider that the two additional squares can be of different sizes. Let's say one is 3x3 (9) and the other is 15, but 15 isn't a perfect square. Or one is 4x4 (16) and the other is 8, which isn't a perfect square. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Instead of trying to fit the areas, maybe I should think about the side lengths and how they can be arranged. If the original square is 8x8, can I arrange 10 squares of 2x2 and two squares of 3x3? Let's see. Each 2x2 square takes up 2 units in both length and width. So, if I have 10 of them, how would they fit? Maybe in a 5x4 grid, but that's 20 squares, which is too many. Wait, no, each 2x2 square covers 2 units in both directions. So, in an 8x8 square, I can fit 4 squares of 2x2 along the length and 4 along the width, making 16 squares of 2x2. But we only need 10, so that's more than enough. But then, where do the two 3x3 squares fit? Each 3x3 square takes up 3 units in both directions. So, in an 8x8 square, I can fit two 3x3 squares along the length and width, but that would require 6 units, leaving 2 units. But 2 units can fit a 2x2 square. Wait, but we already have 10 squares of 2x2. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to draw a diagram or something. But since I can't do that, I'll try to visualize it. If I have an 8x8 square, I can divide it into a 6x6 area and a 2x8 area. The 6x6 area can fit two 3x3 squares, and the 2x8 area can fit four 2x2 squares. But that's only 6 squares of 2x2, and we need 10. Alternatively, maybe divide the 8x8 square into a 4x8 area and a 4x8 area. Each 4x8 area can fit two 2x2 squares along the width and four along the length, making 8 squares of 2x2. So, two 4x8 areas would give 16 squares of 2x2, which is more than the 10 we need. But we also need to fit two more squares. Maybe instead of filling the entire 4x8 areas with 2x2 squares, leave some space for the larger squares. For example, in one 4x8 area, place five 2x2 squares, which would take up 10 units of area, leaving 6 units. But 6 isn't a perfect square. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the total area again. If the original square is 8x8, that's 64. The 10 squares of 2x2 take up 40, leaving 24. So, the two additional squares must add up to 24. The possible perfect squares that add up to 24 are 16 and 8, but 8 isn't a perfect square. 9 and 15, nope. 4 and 20, nope. So, it seems impossible to have two squares that add up to 24 with integer side lengths. Wait, unless one of the squares is larger than 4x4. Let's see, 5x5 is 25, which is too big because 25 + 40 = 65, which is more than 64. So, that doesn't work. Maybe the original square needs to be larger than 8x8. Let's try 9x9, which is 81. Then, 81 - 40 = 41. So, the two additional squares need to add up to 41. The possible perfect squares that add up to 41 are 36 and 5, but 5 isn't a perfect square. 25 and 16, which are both perfect squares. So, 25 + 16 = 41. That works. So, the two additional squares could be 5x5 and 4x4. But wait, 5x5 is 25, and 4x4 is 16. So, total area would be 40 + 25 + 16 = 81, which is 9x9. That works. But is 9x9 the smallest possible? Because I thought 8x8 might work, but it seems like it doesn't because 24 can't be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. For 8x8, total area is 64. 10 squares of 2x2 take up 40, leaving 24. I need two squares that add up to 24. The perfect squares less than 24 are 1, 4, 9, 16. So, 16 + 8, but 8 isn't a perfect square. 9 + 15, nope. 4 + 20, nope. 1 + 23, nope. So, no combination of two perfect squares adds up to 24. Therefore, 8x8 doesn't work. So, the next possible is 9x9. As I calculated earlier, 9x9 gives 81, which allows for 10 squares of 2x2 (40) and two squares of 5x5 and 4x4 (25 + 16 = 41). That works. But wait, is there a way to fit the two additional squares in 8x8 without them being perfect squares? No, because the problem states that all squares must have integer side lengths, so their areas must be perfect squares. Therefore, 8x8 doesn't work. So, the smallest possible original square is 9x9. But wait, let me check if 7x7 works. 7x7 is 49. 49 - 40 = 9. So, the two additional squares need to add up to 9. The perfect squares that add up to 9 are 9 and 0, but 0 isn't valid. Or 4 and 5, but 5 isn't a perfect square. So, 7x7 doesn't work either. Therefore, the smallest possible original square is 9x9. But wait, the answer choices are 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. So, 9 is an option, but I thought 8 might work. But since 8 doesn't work, 9 must be the answer. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 8x8 might work with some arrangement, but mathematically, the areas don't add up. So, I think 9 is the correct answer. But hold on, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If the original square is 8x8, and I have 10 squares of 2x2, that's 40. Then, I need two more squares that add up to 24. Since 24 isn't a sum of two perfect squares, maybe I need to have more than two squares? But the problem says 12 squares in total, so 10 + 2 = 12. So, I can't have more than two additional squares. Therefore, 8x8 doesn't work because the areas don't add up. So, 9x9 is the smallest possible. Wait, but the answer choices include 8, and I thought maybe 8 could work. Maybe I'm missing a configuration where the two additional squares are arranged in a way that their areas don't have to be perfect squares? No, because the problem states that all squares must have integer side lengths, so their areas must be perfect squares. Therefore, I think the answer is 9. But I'm a bit unsure because I thought 8 might work, but mathematically, it doesn't. So, I'll go with 9."},{"question":"For a 2 times 2 contingency table on the left, in a two-dimensional bar chart, the larger the difference between the two ratios dfrac{a}{a+b} and dfrac{c}{c+d}, the possibility of H: \\"x is related to Y\\" ______.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to understand this question about a 2x2 contingency table and how the difference between two ratios affects the possibility of a relationship between two variables, x and Y. Let me break it down step by step.First, what is a 2x2 contingency table? It's a table that shows the frequency distribution of two categorical variables, each with two categories. So, it looks something like this:\`\`\`          Y          Yes  Nox   Yes    a    b      No    c    d\`\`\`Here, 'a' is the number of cases where both x and Y are \\"Yes,\\" 'b' is where x is \\"Yes\\" and Y is \\"No,\\" and so on.The question mentions two ratios: a/(a+b) and c/(c+d). Let me figure out what these ratios represent. - a/(a+b) is the proportion of \\"Yes\\" responses for Y when x is \\"Yes.\\" So, it's like the success rate of Y when x is present.- c/(c+d) is the proportion of \\"Yes\\" responses for Y when x is \\"No.\\" So, it's the success rate of Y when x is absent.The question is asking about the relationship between the difference in these two ratios and the possibility that x is related to Y. In other words, if the difference between a/(a+b) and c/(c+d) is large, does that mean x and Y are more likely to be related?I remember that in statistics, when we want to test if two categorical variables are independent, we can use a chi-square test. The chi-square test compares the observed frequencies in the contingency table to the expected frequencies if the variables were independent.So, if the observed frequencies are very different from the expected frequencies, it suggests that the variables are not independent, meaning they are related. The larger the difference, the more likely we are to reject the null hypothesis of independence.Now, how does this relate to the ratios a/(a+b) and c/(c+d)? If these two ratios are very different, it means that the proportion of Y=\\"Yes\\" is quite different between the two groups defined by x. This would result in larger differences between observed and expected frequencies, leading to a larger chi-square statistic.A larger chi-square statistic means a smaller p-value, which makes it more likely to reject the null hypothesis of independence. Therefore, a larger difference between the two ratios suggests a stronger relationship between x and Y.Let me think if there are any exceptions or other factors. Well, the sample size also plays a role. If the sample size is very large, even small differences can become statistically significant. But assuming we're dealing with a reasonable sample size, the general idea holds.Also, I recall that in a bar chart, if the bars representing these ratios are far apart, it visually indicates a strong association between the variables. So, the larger the visual difference in the bar chart, the more likely the variables are related.In summary, the larger the difference between a/(a+b) and c/(c+d), the more evidence we have against the null hypothesis of independence, suggesting that x and Y are related."},{"question":"Show thatn^{7}-14 n^{5}+49 n^{3}-36 nis divisible by 2520 if n is a natural number.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to show that the expression ( n^{7} - 14n^{5} + 49n^{3} - 36n ) is divisible by 2520 for any natural number ( n ). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First off, I know that 2520 is a specific number, and I remember it's related to factorials. Let me check: 2520 is actually the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 10. That means it's divisible by all these numbers. So, if I can show that the given expression is divisible by each of these numbers, then it should be divisible by 2520 as well.But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than checking divisibility by each number individually. Maybe I can factor the expression somehow. Let me look at the polynomial:( n^{7} - 14n^{5} + 49n^{3} - 36n )I notice that each term has an ( n ) in it, so I can factor that out:( n(n^{6} - 14n^{4} + 49n^{2} - 36) )Okay, so now I have ( n ) times a sixth-degree polynomial. Hmm, maybe I can factor this sixth-degree polynomial further. Let me see if I can recognize a pattern or maybe factor it as a quadratic in terms of ( n^2 ).Let me set ( m = n^2 ), so the polynomial becomes:( m^{3} - 14m^{2} + 49m - 36 )Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Maybe I can factor this cubic polynomial. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 36 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36.Let me test ( m = 1 ):( 1 - 14 + 49 - 36 = 0 ). Oh, that works! So ( m - 1 ) is a factor.Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division with ( m = 1 ):Coefficients: 1 | -14 | 49 | -36Bring down the 1.Multiply by 1: 1Add to next coefficient: -14 + 1 = -13Multiply by 1: -13Add to next coefficient: 49 + (-13) = 36Multiply by 1: 36Add to last coefficient: -36 + 36 = 0So, the polynomial factors as ( (m - 1)(m^{2} - 13m + 36) ).Now, let's factor ( m^{2} - 13m + 36 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to 36 and add to -13. Those would be -4 and -9.So, ( m^{2} - 13m + 36 = (m - 4)(m - 9) ).Putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:( (m - 1)(m - 4)(m - 9) )But remember, ( m = n^2 ), so substituting back:( (n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4)(n^2 - 9) )Each of these is a difference of squares, so they can be factored further:( (n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)(n + 2)(n - 3)(n + 3) )So, the entire expression becomes:( n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)(n + 2)(n - 3)(n + 3) )Wow, that's a product of seven consecutive integers: ( (n - 3)(n - 2)(n - 1)n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3) ).Now, I remember that the product of ( k ) consecutive integers is divisible by ( k! ). In this case, we have seven consecutive integers, so the product should be divisible by ( 7! ).Calculating ( 7! ):( 7! = 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 5040 )But wait, 5040 is double 2520. Hmm, so why is the problem asking for divisibility by 2520 and not 5040?Let me think. Maybe because the product of seven consecutive integers is actually divisible by more than just ( 7! ). Let me check the prime factors of 2520 and 5040.2520 factors: ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 )5040 factors: ( 2^4 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 )So, 2520 is half of 5040, specifically, it has one less factor of 2.But in our product of seven consecutive integers, how many factors of 2 do we have?In any seven consecutive integers, there are at least three even numbers, and among those, at least one is divisible by 4, contributing an extra factor of 2. So, total factors of 2 would be at least ( 2^3 ).Similarly, factors of 3: in seven consecutive numbers, there are at least two multiples of 3, contributing ( 3^2 ).Factors of 5: at least one multiple of 5.Factors of 7: at least one multiple of 7.So, the product is divisible by ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 = 2520 ).Therefore, the expression ( n^{7} - 14n^{5} + 49n^{3} - 36n ) is divisible by 2520 for any natural number ( n ).I think that makes sense. I started by factoring the polynomial, recognized it as a product of seven consecutive integers, and then analyzed the divisibility based on the prime factors required for 2520. It all checks out!"},{"question":"Given that 4 empty mineral water bottles can be exchanged for 1 bottle of mineral water, and there are 16 empty mineral water bottles, if no money is paid, the maximum number of bottles of mineral water that can be drunk is ( ).A: 3 bottlesB: 4 bottlesC: 5 bottlesD: 6 bottles","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about exchanging empty mineral water bottles for new ones. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. Okay, the problem says that 4 empty bottles can be exchanged for 1 full bottle of mineral water. And we start with 16 empty bottles. The question is asking for the maximum number of bottles of mineral water that can be drunk without spending any money. The options are A: 3 bottles, B: 4 bottles, C: 5 bottles, and D: 6 bottles.First, I need to understand the exchange rate. For every 4 empty bottles, I get 1 full bottle. So, if I have 16 empty bottles, how many full bottles can I get initially? Well, 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, I can exchange 16 empty bottles for 4 full bottles. That seems straightforward.Now, after drinking those 4 full bottles, I'll have 4 empty bottles again. But wait, the exchange rate is 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle, so I can exchange these 4 empty bottles for another full bottle. That means I can drink 1 more bottle, bringing the total to 5 bottles drunk so far.But here's where it gets a bit tricky. After drinking that additional bottle, I'll have 1 empty bottle left. But the exchange rate requires 4 empty bottles to get another full bottle, and I only have 1 empty bottle now. So, I can't exchange that single bottle for another full one. Does that mean I'm done?Wait a minute, maybe I can think of this differently. What if I keep track of the empty bottles as I go along? Let me try to break it down step by step.1. Start with 16 empty bottles.2. Exchange 16 empty bottles for 4 full bottles. Now, I have 0 empty bottles and 4 full bottles.3. Drink the 4 full bottles, which gives me 4 empty bottles.4. Exchange those 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now, I have 0 empty bottles and 1 full bottle.5. Drink the 1 full bottle, which gives me 1 empty bottle.At this point, I have 1 empty bottle left, which isn't enough to exchange for another full bottle. So, in total, I've drunk 4 + 1 = 5 bottles.But wait, is there a way to get more bottles by managing the empty bottles differently? Maybe I can save some empty bottles from the initial exchange to use later. Let's see.Suppose I don't exchange all 16 empty bottles at once. Instead, I exchange them in smaller batches to see if I can get more full bottles. For example, if I exchange 12 empty bottles, I get 3 full bottles. Then, I have 4 empty bottles left. After drinking the 3 full bottles, I have 3 empty bottles plus the 4 I saved, totaling 7 empty bottles. Then, I can exchange 4 of those 7 for 1 full bottle, leaving me with 3 empty bottles. Drinking that 1 full bottle gives me 1 empty bottle, so now I have 4 empty bottles again. I can exchange those 4 for 1 full bottle, drink it, and have 1 empty bottle left. So, in this scenario, I've drunk 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 bottles. Hmm, same result.Alternatively, what if I exchange 8 empty bottles for 2 full bottles? Then, I have 8 empty bottles left. After drinking the 2 full bottles, I have 2 empty bottles plus the 8 I saved, totaling 10 empty bottles. Then, I can exchange 8 of those 10 for 2 full bottles, leaving me with 2 empty bottles. Drinking those 2 full bottles gives me 2 empty bottles, so now I have 4 empty bottles. I can exchange those 4 for 1 full bottle, drink it, and have 1 empty bottle left. So, in this case, I've drunk 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 bottles again.It seems like no matter how I break it down, I end up with a total of 5 bottles drunk. Is there a way to get more than 5? Let's try another approach.Suppose I exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle, drink it, and have 1 empty bottle left. Then, I have 12 empty bottles remaining. I can exchange 12 empty bottles for 3 full bottles, drink them, and have 3 empty bottles. Adding the 1 empty bottle from before, I have 4 empty bottles. I can exchange those 4 for 1 full bottle, drink it, and have 1 empty bottle left. So, total drunk is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 bottles.Again, the same result. It seems like 5 is the maximum number of bottles I can drink with 16 empty bottles under the given exchange rate.Wait, but the options include 6 bottles. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps I can use the empty bottles from the exchanges in a way that allows me to get an extra bottle.Starting with 16 empty bottles:1. Exchange 16 for 4 full bottles. Drink them, now have 4 empty.2. Exchange 4 for 1 full bottle. Drink it, now have 1 empty.3. Now, I have 1 empty bottle. If I can somehow get 3 more empty bottles, I can exchange them for another full bottle. But I don't have any more empty bottles to get.Alternatively, maybe I can borrow an empty bottle, exchange it for a full one, drink it, and return the empty bottle. But the problem says no money is paid, so I don't think borrowing is allowed.Another thought: Maybe the process can be repeated with the empty bottles from the exchanges. Let's see.After step 2, I have 1 empty bottle. If I could get 3 more empty bottles somehow, I could exchange them for 1 full bottle. But since I don't have any more, I can't do that.Wait, what if I consider that when I exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle, I'm effectively reducing the number of empty bottles by 4 and increasing the full bottles by 1. So, the net change is -4 empty, +1 full. Then, when I drink the full bottle, I get +1 empty. So, the net change after drinking is -4 empty, +1 empty, which is -3 empty.Starting with 16 empty:1. Exchange 16 for 4 full. Now, 0 empty, 4 full.2. Drink 4 full, get 4 empty. Now, 4 empty, 0 full.3. Exchange 4 empty for 1 full. Now, 0 empty, 1 full.4. Drink 1 full, get 1 empty. Now, 1 empty, 0 full.Total drunk: 4 + 1 = 5.Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to have more empty bottles after each exchange. Let's see.After step 1: 0 empty, 4 full.After step 2: 4 empty, 0 full.After step 3: 0 empty, 1 full.After step 4: 1 empty, 0 full.No way to get more than 5.Wait, what if I don't drink all the bottles at once? Maybe I can stagger the drinking and exchanging to maximize the number of bottles.But I think that would complicate things without necessarily increasing the total number of bottles drunk.Another angle: Maybe the problem is designed to trick me into thinking it's 4, but it's actually 5. Because 16 divided by 4 is 4, but then you have 4 empty bottles from drinking those 4, which can be exchanged for 1 more, making it 5.Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 5 bottles, which is option C.But wait, let me double-check. Starting with 16:1. Exchange 16 for 4 full. Drink them, now have 4 empty.2. Exchange 4 for 1 full. Drink it, now have 1 empty.Total drunk: 4 + 1 = 5.Yes, that's correct. So, the maximum number of bottles that can be drunk is 5."},{"question":"Given f(sin alpha + cos alpha) = sin alpha cos alpha, find f(sin frac{pi}{6}) = (   )A: -frac{3}{8}B: frac{1}{8}C: -frac{1}{8}D: frac{sqrt{3}}{8}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that ( f(sin alpha + cos alpha) = sin alpha cos alpha ), I need to find ( fleft(sin frac{pi}{6}right) ). The options are A: ( -frac{3}{8} ), B: ( frac{1}{8} ), C: ( -frac{1}{8} ), and D: ( frac{sqrt{3}}{8} ).Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I know that ( sin frac{pi}{6} ) is a specific value. I remember that ( sin frac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2} ). So, essentially, I need to find ( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) ).But how do I connect this to the given function ( f(sin alpha + cos alpha) = sin alpha cos alpha )? It seems like ( f ) is defined in terms of ( sin alpha + cos alpha ), but I need to find its value at ( frac{1}{2} ). Maybe I need to express ( f ) in terms of a variable, say ( t ), where ( t = sin alpha + cos alpha ).Let me try that. Let’s set ( t = sin alpha + cos alpha ). Then, according to the problem, ( f(t) = sin alpha cos alpha ). So, if I can express ( sin alpha cos alpha ) in terms of ( t ), I can find an expression for ( f(t) ).I recall that ( (sin alpha + cos alpha)^2 = sin^2 alpha + 2 sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha ). Since ( sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1 ), this simplifies to ( t^2 = 1 + 2 sin alpha cos alpha ). So, rearranging this, ( 2 sin alpha cos alpha = t^2 - 1 ), which means ( sin alpha cos alpha = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ). Therefore, ( f(t) = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ).Great, so now I have an expression for ( f(t) ). Now, I need to find ( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) ). Let me plug ( t = frac{1}{2} ) into the expression:( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 1}{2} = frac{frac{1}{4} - 1}{2} = frac{-frac{3}{4}}{2} = -frac{3}{8} ).So, the value of ( fleft(sin frac{pi}{6}right) ) is ( -frac{3}{8} ), which corresponds to option A.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I set ( t = sin alpha + cos alpha ), then squared both sides to get ( t^2 = 1 + 2 sin alpha cos alpha ). Solving for ( sin alpha cos alpha ) gives ( frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ), so ( f(t) = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ). Plugging in ( t = frac{1}{2} ) gives ( frac{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 1}{2} = frac{frac{1}{4} - 1}{2} = frac{-frac{3}{4}}{2} = -frac{3}{8} ). Yep, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by choosing a specific angle ( alpha ) such that ( sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{2} ), and then computing ( sin alpha cos alpha ) directly. But that might be more complicated because solving for ( alpha ) when ( sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{2} ) would involve some inverse trigonometric functions, which could be messy.Alternatively, I can think about the range of ( t = sin alpha + cos alpha ). Since ( sin alpha + cos alpha ) can be rewritten as ( sqrt{2} sin left( alpha + frac{pi}{4} right) ), the maximum value of ( t ) is ( sqrt{2} ) and the minimum is ( -sqrt{2} ). So, ( t ) ranges between ( -sqrt{2} ) and ( sqrt{2} ). Since ( frac{1}{2} ) is within this interval, it's a valid input for ( f(t) ).Another thing to check: is the function ( f(t) = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ) valid for all ( t ) in ( [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}] )? Let me see. If ( t = sqrt{2} ), then ( f(t) = frac{2 - 1}{2} = frac{1}{2} ), which makes sense because ( sin alpha cos alpha ) would be ( frac{1}{2} ) when ( sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2} ) (which occurs at ( alpha = frac{pi}{4} )). Similarly, if ( t = 0 ), then ( f(t) = frac{0 - 1}{2} = -frac{1}{2} ), which is also correct because ( sin alpha cos alpha = -frac{1}{2} ) when ( sin alpha + cos alpha = 0 ) (for example, at ( alpha = frac{3pi}{4} )).So, the function ( f(t) = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ) seems to be correctly derived and valid within the required domain. Therefore, substituting ( t = frac{1}{2} ) into this function should give the correct result.Just to recap:1. Start with ( f(sin alpha + cos alpha) = sin alpha cos alpha ).2. Let ( t = sin alpha + cos alpha ).3. Square both sides: ( t^2 = 1 + 2 sin alpha cos alpha ).4. Solve for ( sin alpha cos alpha ): ( sin alpha cos alpha = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ).5. Therefore, ( f(t) = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} ).6. Substitute ( t = frac{1}{2} ): ( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 1}{2} = -frac{3}{8} ).Everything checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is ( -frac{3}{8} ), which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{-frac{3}{8}}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=|x+2|-|x-1|.- (1) Find the range of f(x).- (2) Let g(x)= frac {ax^{2}-3x+3}{x} (a > 0). If for any sin[1,+infty) and tin[0,+infty), g(s)geqslant f(t) always holds, find the range of the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the function f(x) = |x + 2| - |x - 1|. There are two parts: first, I need to find the range of f(x), and second, I have another function g(x) = (a x² - 3x + 3)/x where a > 0. The condition is that for any s in [1, ∞) and t in [0, ∞), g(s) should be greater than or equal to f(t). I need to find the range of a.Starting with part (1): Find the range of f(x) = |x + 2| - |x - 1|.Hmm, I remember that absolute value functions can be tricky because they change their behavior depending on whether the expression inside is positive or negative. So, I think I should break down f(x) into different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. For |x + 2|, the critical point is at x = -2, and for |x - 1|, it's at x = 1. So, I can consider three intervals: x < -2, -2 ≤ x < 1, and x ≥ 1.Let me write down each case:1. When x < -2:   - x + 2 is negative, so |x + 2| = -(x + 2) = -x - 2.   - x - 1 is also negative, so |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1.   - Therefore, f(x) = (-x - 2) - (-x + 1) = -x - 2 + x - 1 = -3.2. When -2 ≤ x < 1:   - x + 2 is non-negative, so |x + 2| = x + 2.   - x - 1 is still negative, so |x - 1| = -x + 1.   - Therefore, f(x) = (x + 2) - (-x + 1) = x + 2 + x - 1 = 2x + 1.3. When x ≥ 1:   - Both x + 2 and x - 1 are non-negative, so |x + 2| = x + 2 and |x - 1| = x - 1.   - Therefore, f(x) = (x + 2) - (x - 1) = x + 2 - x + 1 = 3.So, summarizing:- For x < -2, f(x) = -3.- For -2 ≤ x < 1, f(x) = 2x + 1.- For x ≥ 1, f(x) = 3.Now, let's find the range of f(x). In the first interval, it's just -3. In the third interval, it's 3. In the middle interval, f(x) = 2x + 1. Since x ranges from -2 to 1, let's find the minimum and maximum of this linear function.When x = -2, f(x) = 2*(-2) + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3.When x = 1, f(x) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.So, in the middle interval, f(x) increases from -3 to 3. Therefore, combining all intervals, the range of f(x) is from -3 to 3. So, the range is [-3, 3].Wait, but the initial thought in the problem statement used the triangle inequality to get that the range is between -3 and 3. So, that seems consistent. So, part (1) is done.Moving on to part (2): Let g(x) = (a x² - 3x + 3)/x, where a > 0. We need to ensure that for any s in [1, ∞) and t in [0, ∞), g(s) ≥ f(t) always holds. So, essentially, the minimum value of g(s) on [1, ∞) should be greater than or equal to the maximum value of f(t) on [0, ∞).From part (1), we know that f(t) has a maximum value of 3. So, we need to ensure that the minimum of g(s) on [1, ∞) is at least 3.First, let's simplify g(x):g(x) = (a x² - 3x + 3)/x = a x - 3 + 3/x.So, g(x) = a x + 3/x - 3.We need to find the minimum of g(x) on [1, ∞). Since a > 0, let's analyze this function.g(x) = a x + 3/x - 3.To find the minimum, we can take the derivative and set it to zero.g'(x) = a - 3/x².Set g'(x) = 0:a - 3/x² = 0 => a = 3/x² => x² = 3/a => x = sqrt(3/a).But we need to check if this critical point is within our interval [1, ∞). So, sqrt(3/a) must be ≥ 1.sqrt(3/a) ≥ 1 => 3/a ≥ 1 => a ≤ 3.So, if a ≤ 3, the critical point is within [1, ∞); otherwise, the minimum occurs at x = 1.Therefore, we have two cases:1. When a ≤ 3: The minimum occurs at x = sqrt(3/a). Let's compute g at this point.g(sqrt(3/a)) = a * sqrt(3/a) + 3 / sqrt(3/a) - 3.Simplify:a * sqrt(3/a) = sqrt(a² * 3/a) = sqrt(3a).Similarly, 3 / sqrt(3/a) = 3 * sqrt(a/3) = sqrt(3a).So, g(sqrt(3/a)) = sqrt(3a) + sqrt(3a) - 3 = 2 sqrt(3a) - 3.2. When a > 3: The critical point is at x = sqrt(3/a) < 1, so the minimum occurs at x = 1.Compute g(1):g(1) = a * 1 + 3/1 - 3 = a + 3 - 3 = a.So, summarizing:- If 0 < a ≤ 3, the minimum of g(x) on [1, ∞) is 2 sqrt(3a) - 3.- If a > 3, the minimum is a.We need this minimum to be ≥ 3, because f(t) can be as large as 3.So, set up the inequality:Case 1: 0 < a ≤ 3:2 sqrt(3a) - 3 ≥ 3.Solve for a:2 sqrt(3a) - 3 ≥ 32 sqrt(3a) ≥ 6sqrt(3a) ≥ 3Square both sides:3a ≥ 9a ≥ 3.But in this case, a ≤ 3, so the only solution is a = 3.Case 2: a > 3:Minimum is a, so a ≥ 3.But since a > 3, this is automatically satisfied.Combining both cases, the solutions are a ≥ 3.Wait, but in Case 1, when 0 < a ≤ 3, the inequality 2 sqrt(3a) - 3 ≥ 3 only holds when a = 3. So, the only valid a in this case is a = 3. For a < 3, 2 sqrt(3a) - 3 < 3, which doesn't satisfy the condition.Therefore, the range of a is a ≥ 3.Hmm, let me double-check.If a = 3, then g(x) = 3x + 3/x - 3.The critical point is at x = sqrt(3/3) = 1. So, the minimum is at x = 1, which is g(1) = 3 + 3 - 3 = 3. So, that's exactly equal to 3, which is the maximum of f(t). So, that's good.If a > 3, say a = 4, then the minimum of g(x) is a = 4, which is greater than 3, so it's fine.If a < 3, say a = 1, then the minimum is 2 sqrt(3*1) - 3 ≈ 2*1.732 - 3 ≈ 3.464 - 3 ≈ 0.464, which is less than 3. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.Therefore, the range of a is [3, ∞).So, the answer is a ≥ 3.**Final Answer**(1) The range of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{[-3, 3]}).(2) The range of the real number ( a ) is (boxed{[3, +infty)})."},{"question":"Bingo has three dogs.

If the distance from the center of the circle to each tangent is 6 cm, how many points are equidistant from the circle and both tangents?A) 0B) 1C) 2D) 3E) 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a circle with two parallel tangents. Let me try to visualize it first. The circle has a radius of 4 cm, and the distance from the center of the circle to each tangent is 6 cm. Hmm, that's interesting because the distance from the center to the tangent is usually equal to the radius if the tangent touches the circle. But here, it's 6 cm, which is more than the radius of 4 cm. So, does that mean the tangents are outside the circle?Wait, actually, if the distance from the center to the tangent is greater than the radius, that means the tangent doesn't touch the circle. So, these are external tangents. So, the circle is sitting between two parallel lines that are each 6 cm away from the center. Since the radius is 4 cm, the circle doesn't reach the tangents; there's a gap of 2 cm between the circle and each tangent.Now, the question is asking how many points are equidistant from the circle and both tangents. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find points that are equally distant from the circle and from both tangents. Let me break this down.First, let's think about what it means for a point to be equidistant from the circle. The distance from a point to a circle is the shortest distance from that point to any point on the circle. Since the circle has a radius of 4 cm, if a point is outside the circle, its distance to the circle would be the distance from the point to the center minus the radius. If the point is inside the circle, the distance would be the radius minus the distance from the point to the center. But in this case, since the tangents are 6 cm away from the center, which is more than the radius, the points we're looking for are probably outside the circle.Next, the point needs to be equidistant from both tangents. Since the tangents are parallel, the set of points equidistant from both tangents lies on the line that's midway between them. That line would be parallel to the tangents and pass through the center of the circle because the center is equidistant (6 cm) from both tangents.So, the points we're looking for must lie on this midline. Now, on this midline, we need to find points that are also equidistant from the circle. Let's denote the center of the circle as O. The midline passes through O, so any point on this line can be represented as a point along this line at some distance from O.Let's denote the distance from O to a point P on the midline as x. Since the point P is on the midline, its distance to each tangent is 6 cm minus x, but wait, actually, no. The distance from P to each tangent is the same because it's on the midline. Since the tangents are 6 cm away from O, and P is on the midline, the distance from P to each tangent is |6 - x| if P is between O and the tangent, or |x - 6| if P is on the other side. But since the tangents are 6 cm away from O, and the radius is 4 cm, the circle doesn't reach the tangents, so the distance from P to the circle would be |x - 4| if P is outside the circle, or 4 - |x| if P is inside the circle.Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. The distance from P to the circle is the minimum distance from P to any point on the circle. If P is outside the circle, that distance is |OP| - radius, which is |x| - 4. If P is inside the circle, the distance would be 4 - |x|.But since the tangents are 6 cm away from O, and the radius is 4 cm, the circle doesn't reach the tangents, so P is outside the circle if it's on the side towards the tangents. So, if P is on the midline beyond the tangents, its distance to the circle would be |x| - 4, and its distance to the tangents would be |x - 6|.Wait, no. If P is on the midline, which is the line through O, then the distance from P to each tangent is the same. Since the tangents are 6 cm from O, and P is on the midline, the distance from P to each tangent is |6 - x| if P is between O and the tangent, or |x - 6| if P is beyond the tangent. But since the tangents are external, P can be on either side of O along the midline.So, let's consider two cases: P is between O and the tangent, and P is beyond the tangent.Case 1: P is between O and the tangent. Then, the distance from P to the tangent is 6 - x, and the distance from P to the circle is 4 - x (since P is inside the circle). Wait, but if P is between O and the tangent, and the tangent is 6 cm away, and the radius is 4 cm, then P can't be inside the circle because 4 cm is less than 6 cm. So, actually, if P is between O and the tangent, it's still outside the circle because the circle's radius is 4 cm, and O is 6 cm away from the tangent. So, the distance from P to the circle would be x - 4, and the distance from P to the tangent is 6 - x.We need these two distances to be equal: x - 4 = 6 - x. Solving for x: 2x = 10, so x = 5 cm. So, there's a point 5 cm from O towards the tangent that is equidistant to the circle and the tangent.Case 2: P is beyond the tangent, meaning it's on the other side of the tangent from O. Then, the distance from P to the tangent is x - 6, and the distance from P to the circle is x - 4 (since P is outside the circle). Setting these equal: x - 4 = x - 6. Wait, that simplifies to -4 = -6, which is not possible. So, no solution in this case.Wait, that doesn't make sense. If P is beyond the tangent, the distance to the tangent is x - 6, and the distance to the circle is x - 4. Setting them equal: x - 4 = x - 6, which simplifies to -4 = -6, which is impossible. So, no solution in this case.But wait, maybe I made a mistake. If P is beyond the tangent, the distance from P to the tangent is x - 6, and the distance from P to the circle is x - 4. So, setting x - 4 = x - 6 gives no solution, which means there's no point beyond the tangent that is equidistant to the circle and the tangent.But wait, what about on the other side of O, away from the tangent? Let's consider P on the opposite side of O from the tangent. Then, the distance from P to the tangent would be 6 + x, and the distance from P to the circle would be x + 4 (since P is outside the circle on the opposite side). Setting these equal: x + 4 = 6 + x, which simplifies to 4 = 6, which is also impossible. So, no solution there either.Wait, so only in Case 1 do we get a solution, which is x = 5 cm. So, there's one point on the midline towards the tangent that is equidistant to the circle and the tangent.But wait, the problem says \\"both tangents.\\" So, we have two parallel tangents, each 6 cm from O. So, there's a tangent on one side of the circle and another tangent on the opposite side, also 6 cm from O. So, the midline is the line through O, and we can have points on both sides of O on this midline.So, let's consider both sides.First, towards one tangent: we found a point at x = 5 cm from O. Similarly, on the opposite side, towards the other tangent, we can have another point at x = 5 cm from O in the opposite direction. So, that would be two points: one 5 cm towards one tangent, and another 5 cm towards the other tangent.Wait, but earlier, when I considered the other side beyond the tangent, I didn't get a solution, but maybe I should consider the point on the opposite side of O, not beyond the tangent.Wait, let me clarify. The midline is the line through O, and the two tangents are on opposite sides of O, each 6 cm away. So, on the midline, we can have points on either side of O.So, for the first tangent, on one side, we have a point 5 cm from O towards that tangent. Similarly, on the opposite side, towards the other tangent, we have another point 5 cm from O. So, that's two points.Wait, but earlier, when I considered the point beyond the tangent, I didn't get a solution, but maybe I should consider the point on the opposite side of O, not beyond the tangent. So, if P is on the opposite side of O from the tangent, the distance from P to the tangent is 6 + x, and the distance from P to the circle is x + 4. Setting them equal: x + 4 = 6 + x, which gives 4 = 6, which is impossible. So, no solution there.But wait, if P is on the same side as the tangent, but beyond the tangent, we have distance to tangent as x - 6, and distance to circle as x - 4. Setting equal: x - 4 = x - 6, which is impossible. So, no solution beyond the tangent.But on the opposite side of O, towards the other tangent, we have another point at x = 5 cm from O, which would be 5 cm towards the other tangent. So, that's another point.Wait, but if I consider the point on the opposite side of O, towards the other tangent, the distance from P to the tangent is 6 - x, and the distance from P to the circle is x - 4. Setting equal: x - 4 = 6 - x, which gives 2x = 10, so x = 5 cm. So, that's another point.So, in total, there are two points: one 5 cm towards one tangent, and another 5 cm towards the other tangent.Wait, but earlier, I thought only one point, but now I'm getting two points. Hmm.Wait, let me think again. The midline is the line through O, and the two tangents are on opposite sides, each 6 cm from O. So, on the midline, we can have points on either side of O.For each tangent, there's a point on the midline towards that tangent at x = 5 cm from O. So, that's two points in total.But wait, when I considered the point beyond the tangent, I didn't get a solution, but the point on the opposite side of O towards the other tangent does give a solution.So, in total, there are two points: one on each side of O on the midline, each 5 cm away from O towards their respective tangents.Therefore, the number of points equidistant from the circle and both tangents is 2.Wait, but the options are A) 0, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3, E) 4.So, the answer should be C) 2.But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the points are not only on the midline but also somewhere else. Wait, the problem says \\"equidistant from the circle and both tangents.\\" So, the point must be equidistant to both tangents and also equidistant to the circle.Since the tangents are parallel, the set of points equidistant to both tangents is the midline. So, any point equidistant to both tangents must lie on the midline. Therefore, the only possible points are on the midline.On the midline, we found two points: one on each side of O, each 5 cm away from O towards their respective tangents.Therefore, the answer is 2, which is option C.Wait, but earlier, I thought only one point, but now I'm convinced it's two points.Alternatively, maybe the center O is also equidistant to the circle and the tangents. Let's check.The distance from O to the circle is zero because O is the center. The distance from O to each tangent is 6 cm. So, zero is not equal to 6 cm, so O is not equidistant to the circle and the tangents.Therefore, the only points are the two points on the midline, each 5 cm from O towards the tangents.So, the answer is 2, which is option C."},{"question":"A book library charges fifty cents per day on any book borrowed by its members to read outside the library's premises.

The question is asking about the range of values for m such that the equation has real solutions. The options are A: m ≠ 2, B: m ≤ 3, C: m ≥ 3, D: m ≤ 3 and m ≠ 2.Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 to have real solutions, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero. The discriminant is b² - 4ac. So, I need to calculate the discriminant for this equation and set it to be ≥ 0.But wait, before that, I should check if the equation is actually quadratic. Because if m - 2 equals zero, then the equation becomes linear, right? So, if m - 2 = 0, then m = 2. In that case, the equation simplifies to -2x + 1 = 0, which is a linear equation and definitely has a real solution. So, m = 2 is acceptable because the equation still has a real solution.But when m ≠ 2, the equation is quadratic. So, I need to consider both cases: when m = 2 and when m ≠ 2.First, let's handle the case when m ≠ 2. So, the equation is quadratic, and the discriminant must be ≥ 0. Let's calculate the discriminant.Given the equation: (m - 2)x² - 2x + 1 = 0.Here, a = (m - 2), b = -2, c = 1.So, discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac = (-2)² - 4*(m - 2)*1 = 4 - 4(m - 2).Simplify that: 4 - 4m + 8 = 12 - 4m.Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me recalculate:Δ = (-2)² - 4*(m - 2)*1 = 4 - 4*(m - 2).So, 4 - 4m + 8? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 4 - 4*(m - 2) is 4 - 4m + 8? Wait, no, 4*(m - 2) is 4m - 8, so 4 - (4m - 8) is 4 - 4m + 8, which is 12 - 4m. Hmm, that seems right.Wait, but let me think again. The discriminant is 4 - 4*(m - 2). So, 4 - 4m + 8? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 4*(m - 2) is 4m - 8, so 4 - (4m - 8) is 4 - 4m + 8, which is 12 - 4m. Yeah, that's correct.So, Δ = 12 - 4m.For the quadratic to have real solutions, Δ ≥ 0.So, 12 - 4m ≥ 0.Let's solve for m:12 - 4m ≥ 0Subtract 12 from both sides: -4m ≥ -12Divide both sides by -4. Wait, but when you divide by a negative number, you have to reverse the inequality sign.So, m ≤ 3.Okay, so when m ≠ 2, we have m ≤ 3.But earlier, we saw that when m = 2, the equation is linear and still has a real solution. So, m = 2 is acceptable.Therefore, combining both cases, m can be equal to 2 or m ≤ 3.Wait, but hold on. If m = 2 is allowed, and m ≤ 3 includes m = 2, then the range is m ≤ 3.But let me check the options again.A: m ≠ 2B: m ≤ 3C: m ≥ 3D: m ≤ 3 and m ≠ 2So, if m = 2 is allowed, then the correct range is m ≤ 3, which is option B.But wait, let me think again. When m = 2, it's a linear equation, which has exactly one real solution. So, it's acceptable. So, m = 2 is included in m ≤ 3.But wait, in the quadratic case, when m ≠ 2, we have m ≤ 3. So, m can be 2 or any number less than or equal to 3.So, the range is m ≤ 3.But let me think about the options. Option B is m ≤ 3, which includes m = 2. Option D is m ≤ 3 and m ≠ 2, which would exclude m = 2, but we know m = 2 is acceptable.So, why is option D there? Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me think again. When m = 2, the equation is linear, so it's not quadratic. But the question says \\"has real solutions,\\" which includes both linear and quadratic cases. So, m = 2 is acceptable because the equation still has a real solution.Therefore, the correct range is m ≤ 3, which is option B.Wait, but in the initial calculation, when m ≠ 2, we have m ≤ 3. So, combining with m = 2, it's m ≤ 3.So, the answer should be B.But let me check the discriminant again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Given the equation: (m - 2)x² - 2x + 1 = 0.a = m - 2, b = -2, c = 1.Δ = b² - 4ac = (-2)² - 4*(m - 2)*1 = 4 - 4(m - 2).Simplify: 4 - 4m + 8 = 12 - 4m.Wait, that's what I did before. So, 12 - 4m ≥ 0.So, 12 ≥ 4m.Divide both sides by 4: 3 ≥ m, which is m ≤ 3.Yes, that's correct.So, when m ≠ 2, m ≤ 3. And when m = 2, it's acceptable. So, overall, m ≤ 3.Therefore, the correct answer is B: m ≤ 3.But wait, let me think again. If m = 2 is allowed, then m can be 2 or less than or equal to 3. So, m ≤ 3 includes m = 2, which is fine.So, the answer is B.But wait, in the initial problem, the options are:A: m ≠ 2B: m ≤ 3C: m ≥ 3D: m ≤ 3 and m ≠ 2So, option D is m ≤ 3 and m ≠ 2, which would exclude m = 2, but we know m = 2 is acceptable because the equation still has a real solution.Therefore, the correct answer is B: m ≤ 3.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, they might consider only quadratic equations, but the question says \\"has real solutions,\\" not necessarily quadratic. So, m = 2 is acceptable.Therefore, the range is m ≤ 3, which is option B.Wait, but in the initial calculation, when m ≠ 2, we have m ≤ 3. So, combining with m = 2, it's m ≤ 3.Yes, that's correct.So, the answer is B."},{"question":"Find the solutions to z^4 = -16. Enter the solutions, separated by commas.","answer":"Okay, so I need to solve the equation ( z^4 = -16 ). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but I remember that equations like this can be solved using polar form or De Moivre's theorem. Let me try to recall how that works.First, I know that any complex number can be expressed in polar form as ( z = r(cos theta + i sin theta) ), where ( r ) is the modulus (or absolute value) and ( theta ) is the argument (or angle). When raising complex numbers to a power, De Moivre's theorem is useful, which states that ( z^n = r^n (cos ntheta + i sin ntheta) ).In this case, I have ( z^4 = -16 ). Let me express -16 in polar form. The modulus of -16 is 16 because it's 16 units away from the origin on the real axis, but since it's negative, it's located on the negative real axis. So, the angle ( theta ) should be ( pi ) radians (or 180 degrees) because it's pointing to the left on the real axis.So, ( -16 ) can be written as ( 16 (cos pi + i sin pi) ). Therefore, the equation becomes:[ z^4 = 16 (cos pi + i sin pi) ]Now, to find the fourth roots of this complex number, I can use the formula for the nth roots of a complex number. The formula is:[ z_k = r^{1/n} left( cos left( frac{theta + 2pi k}{n} right) + i sin left( frac{theta + 2pi k}{n} right) right) ]where ( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 ).In this case, ( n = 4 ), ( r = 16 ), and ( theta = pi ). So, the modulus of each root will be ( r^{1/4} = 16^{1/4} ). Let me calculate that.16 is ( 2^4 ), so ( 16^{1/4} = 2 ). So, each root will have a modulus of 2.Now, the angles for each root will be:[ frac{pi + 2pi k}{4} ]for ( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ).Let me compute each angle:1. For ( k = 0 ):[ theta_0 = frac{pi + 2pi cdot 0}{4} = frac{pi}{4} ]2. For ( k = 1 ):[ theta_1 = frac{pi + 2pi cdot 1}{4} = frac{pi + 2pi}{4} = frac{3pi}{4} ]3. For ( k = 2 ):[ theta_2 = frac{pi + 2pi cdot 2}{4} = frac{pi + 4pi}{4} = frac{5pi}{4} ]4. For ( k = 3 ):[ theta_3 = frac{pi + 2pi cdot 3}{4} = frac{pi + 6pi}{4} = frac{7pi}{4} ]So, the four roots have angles ( pi/4 ), ( 3pi/4 ), ( 5pi/4 ), and ( 7pi/4 ), each with a modulus of 2.Now, let me write each root in rectangular form (a + bi). To do this, I'll use the cosine and sine values for each angle.1. For ( theta_0 = pi/4 ):[ cos pi/4 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ][ sin pi/4 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ]So, the root is:[ 2 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + i frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) = sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ]2. For ( theta_1 = 3pi/4 ):[ cos 3pi/4 = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ][ sin 3pi/4 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ]So, the root is:[ 2 left( -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + i frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) = -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ]3. For ( theta_2 = 5pi/4 ):[ cos 5pi/4 = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ][ sin 5pi/4 = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ]So, the root is:[ 2 left( -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - i frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) = -sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} ]4. For ( theta_3 = 7pi/4 ):[ cos 7pi/4 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ][ sin 7pi/4 = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ]So, the root is:[ 2 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - i frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) = sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} ]Therefore, the four solutions to ( z^4 = -16 ) are:[ sqrt{2} + isqrt{2}, quad -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2}, quad -sqrt{2} - isqrt{2}, quad sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} ]Let me double-check to make sure these are correct. If I raise each of these to the fourth power, they should equal -16.Take ( z = sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ). Let's compute ( z^2 ):[ (sqrt{2} + isqrt{2})^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 + 2 cdot sqrt{2} cdot isqrt{2} + (isqrt{2})^2 = 2 + 2i cdot 2 + (-2) = 2 + 4i - 2 = 4i ]Then, ( z^4 = (z^2)^2 = (4i)^2 = -16 ). That works.Similarly, for ( z = -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ):[ (-sqrt{2} + isqrt{2})^2 = (-sqrt{2})^2 + 2 cdot (-sqrt{2}) cdot isqrt{2} + (isqrt{2})^2 = 2 - 4i - 2 = -4i ]Then, ( z^4 = (-4i)^2 = (-4)^2 cdot i^2 = 16 cdot (-1) = -16 ). That also works.I can check the others similarly, but I think this confirms that the solutions are correct.So, summarizing, the four solutions are:1. ( sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} )2. ( -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} )3. ( -sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} )4. ( sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} )Alternatively, these can be written as:1. ( sqrt{2}(1 + i) )2. ( sqrt{2}(-1 + i) )3. ( sqrt{2}(-1 - i) )4. ( sqrt{2}(1 - i) )Either form is correct, but the first form might be more straightforward since it directly shows the rectangular components.I think that's all. I've found the four roots, converted them from polar to rectangular form, and verified that they satisfy the original equation. So, I'm confident these are the correct solutions."},{"question":"Given M={ymid y=x^{2}} and N={ymid x^{2}+y^{2}=2}, find Mcap N.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the intersection of two sets, M and N. Let me try to understand what each set represents.First, set M is defined as all y such that y equals x squared. So, M is the set of all possible y-values where y is equal to x squared. Since x squared is always non-negative, y must be greater than or equal to zero. So, M is essentially all non-negative real numbers. That makes sense.Now, set N is defined as all y such that x squared plus y squared equals 2. Hmm, this looks familiar. It's the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius sqrt(2). So, N represents all the y-values that lie on this circle. Since it's a circle, y can range from -sqrt(2) to sqrt(2). So, N is the set of all real numbers y where y is between -sqrt(2) and sqrt(2).Okay, so now I need to find the intersection of M and N, which is M ∩ N. The intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, it's all y-values that are in both M and N.Since M is all y greater than or equal to zero, and N is all y between -sqrt(2) and sqrt(2), the overlap between these two sets would be y-values that are both non-negative and less than or equal to sqrt(2). So, the intersection should be all y such that y is between 0 and sqrt(2), inclusive.Let me double-check that. If I take y from M, which is y ≥ 0, and y from N, which is -sqrt(2) ≤ y ≤ sqrt(2), then the overlap is indeed 0 ≤ y ≤ sqrt(2). That seems right.I think I've got it. The intersection of M and N is all y-values from 0 up to sqrt(2). So, in set notation, that would be {y | 0 ≤ y ≤ sqrt(2)}.Just to visualize it, M is the upper half of the coordinate plane (since y is non-negative), and N is the circle around the origin with radius sqrt(2). The overlap between these two would be the portion of the circle that's in the upper half-plane, which is exactly the set of y-values from 0 to sqrt(2).Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. It makes sense both algebraically and geometrically."},{"question":"a) Prove that the Brocard angle of any triangle does not exceed (30^circ).b) Inside triangle (ABC) is a point (M). Prove that one of the angles (ABM), (BCM), and (CAM) does not exceed (30^circ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two geometry problems to work on. Let me start with part (a): proving that the Brocard angle of any triangle doesn't exceed 30 degrees. Hmm, I remember the Brocard angle is this special angle in a triangle where if you draw lines from each vertex to a common point inside the triangle, each of these lines makes the same angle with the sides of the triangle. That common angle is the Brocard angle, denoted by ω.First, I need to recall the formula for the Brocard angle. I think it's related to the cotangent of the angles of the triangle. Let me see... Yes, I believe the formula is:cot ω = cot A + cot B + cot Cwhere A, B, and C are the angles of the triangle. Okay, so if I can find the maximum value of ω, I need to find the minimum value of cot ω because cotangent is a decreasing function in the interval (0, 180 degrees). So, the smaller cot ω is, the larger ω is.Now, since A, B, and C are angles of a triangle, they add up to 180 degrees. I wonder what's the minimum value of cot A + cot B + cot C. I think it occurs when the triangle is equilateral because symmetry often gives extremal values. In an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees, so cot 60° is 1/√3. Therefore, cot A + cot B + cot C = 3*(1/√3) = √3.So, cot ω = √3, which means ω = arccot(√3). I remember that arccot(√3) is 30 degrees because cot 30° = √3. Therefore, the maximum Brocard angle is 30 degrees. That makes sense because in an equilateral triangle, the Brocard angle is exactly 30 degrees, and for any other triangle, it's smaller. So, I think that proves part (a).Moving on to part (b): Inside triangle ABC, there's a point M. I need to prove that one of the angles ABM, BCM, or CAM doesn't exceed 30 degrees. Hmm, okay. So, point M is somewhere inside the triangle, and we're looking at these three angles formed by connecting M to the vertices.I think this might relate to the Brocard angle somehow. Maybe if I consider the Brocard point of the triangle, which is the point where the Brocard angle is achieved. If M is the Brocard point, then all three angles ABM, BCM, and CAM are equal to the Brocard angle, which we just proved is at most 30 degrees. But M isn't necessarily the Brocard point; it's just some arbitrary point inside the triangle.Wait, maybe I can use some kind of averaging argument. If I consider the three angles ABM, BCM, and CAM, their sum must be less than or equal to the sum of the angles at the Brocard point, which is 3 times the Brocard angle. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If I assume that all three angles ABM, BCM, and CAM are greater than 30 degrees, then their sum would be greater than 90 degrees. But the sum of these angles is actually equal to the sum of the angles at point M, which is 360 degrees minus the sum of the angles of the triangle ABC. Since the angles of ABC add up to 180 degrees, the sum of the angles around M is 360 - 180 = 180 degrees. So, if all three angles ABM, BCM, and CAM were greater than 30 degrees, their sum would be greater than 90 degrees, but their actual sum is 180 degrees. Wait, that doesn't directly lead to a contradiction.Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the Brocard point P of triangle ABC. We know that angles ABP, BCP, and CAP are all equal to the Brocard angle ω, which is at most 30 degrees. Now, since M is inside the triangle, it must lie in one of the three smaller triangles formed by the Brocard point P and the sides of ABC. For example, M could be in triangle ABP, BCP, or CAP.Suppose M is in triangle ABP. Then, angle ABM is less than or equal to angle ABP, which is ω, and since ω is at most 30 degrees, angle ABM is at most 30 degrees. Similarly, if M is in triangle BCP, then angle BCM is at most 30 degrees, and if M is in triangle CAP, then angle CAM is at most 30 degrees. Therefore, regardless of where M is inside ABC, at least one of these three angles must be at most 30 degrees.That seems to make sense. By considering the Brocard point and the regions it divides the triangle into, we can argue that M must lie in one of those regions, and thus one of the angles involving M must be bounded by the Brocard angle, which we already know is at most 30 degrees.I think that covers both parts. For part (a), using the cotangent formula and finding the minimum value leads us to the maximum Brocard angle being 30 degrees. For part (b), by leveraging the properties of the Brocard point and the pigeonhole principle, we can show that one of the angles involving point M must be at most 30 degrees."},{"question":"The distance from the point of intersection of a circle's diameter with a chord of length 18 cm, in a circle with radius 11 cm, to the center of the circle is 7 cm. In what ratio does the point of intersection divide the chord?","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"The distance from the point of intersection of a circle's diameter with a chord of length 18 cm, in a circle with radius 11 cm, to the center of the circle is 7 cm. In what ratio does the point of intersection divide the chord?\\"Alright, let me break this down. We have a circle with radius 11 cm. There's a chord in this circle that's 18 cm long. The diameter of the circle intersects this chord at some point, and the distance from this intersection point to the center of the circle is 7 cm. We need to find the ratio in which this intersection point divides the chord.First, let me visualize this. Imagine a circle with center O. There's a diameter, let's say horizontal for simplicity, and a chord AB that's not a diameter because its length is 18 cm, which is less than the diameter (which would be 22 cm since the radius is 11 cm). The diameter intersects the chord AB at point P, and the distance from P to the center O is 7 cm.So, the chord AB is 18 cm, and it's intersected by the diameter at point P, which is 7 cm away from the center. We need to find the ratio AP:PB.Hmm, okay. I remember there's a theorem related to intersecting chords, called the Power of a Point theorem. It states that if two chords intersect at a point, then the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord.In this case, the two chords are the diameter and the chord AB. The diameter passes through the center, so one of its segments is from the center to one end of the diameter, which is 11 cm, and the other segment is from the center to the other end, which is also 11 cm. But wait, the point P is 7 cm away from the center, so the segments of the diameter would be 7 cm and 11 + 7 = 18 cm? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.Let me think. The diameter is a straight line passing through the center, so its total length is 22 cm. If point P is 7 cm away from the center O, then one segment of the diameter from O to P is 7 cm, and the other segment from P to the other end of the diameter would be 22 - 7 = 15 cm. Wait, is that correct?No, actually, if the diameter is 22 cm, and P is 7 cm from O, then the two segments of the diameter would be 7 cm and 15 cm. Because from O to P is 7 cm, and from P to the other end is 22 - 7 = 15 cm.But wait, actually, the diameter is just a straight line, so if P is 7 cm from O towards one end, then the other segment would be 11 cm (the radius) plus 7 cm, which is 18 cm. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the total diameter is 22 cm.Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me draw this mentally. The diameter is 22 cm, center O. Point P is 7 cm from O towards one end. So from O to P is 7 cm, and from P to the other end of the diameter is 22 - 7 = 15 cm. So the two segments are 7 cm and 15 cm.But according to the Power of a Point theorem, the product of the segments of one chord should equal the product of the segments of the other chord. So, for chord AB, which is 18 cm, it's divided into two parts: AP and PB. Let me denote AP as x and PB as 18 - x.Then, according to the theorem, AP * PB = OP * (diameter segment). Wait, no, the theorem says that for two intersecting chords, the products of the segments are equal. So, in this case, chord AB is intersected by the diameter at P, so AP * PB = OP * (diameter segment from P to the other end).Wait, but the diameter is a straight line, so the segments would be OP and the other part, which is the entire diameter minus OP. Wait, no, the diameter is 22 cm, so if OP is 7 cm, then the other segment would be 22 - 7 = 15 cm.So, according to the Power of a Point theorem, AP * PB = OP * (diameter segment). So, AP * PB = 7 * 15 = 105.But wait, AP * PB should also be equal to the product of the segments of chord AB, which is x * (18 - x). So, x * (18 - x) = 105.Let me write that down:x(18 - x) = 105Expanding this:18x - x² = 105Rearranging:x² - 18x + 105 = 0Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let's use the quadratic formula:x = [18 ± √(18² - 4*1*105)] / 2Calculating the discriminant:18² = 3244*1*105 = 420So, discriminant = 324 - 420 = -96Wait, that's negative. That can't be right because we can't have a negative distance. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me go back. Maybe I misapplied the Power of a Point theorem. Let me double-check.The Power of a Point theorem states that if two chords intersect at a point P inside the circle, then AP * PB = CP * PD, where CP and PD are the segments of the other chord.In this case, the other chord is the diameter, which is divided into two segments by point P: OP and the other segment, which is the entire diameter minus OP.Wait, but the diameter is 22 cm, so if OP is 7 cm, then the other segment is 22 - 7 = 15 cm. So, CP * PD would be 7 * 15 = 105.But AP * PB = x * (18 - x) = 105.So, x² - 18x + 105 = 0But the discriminant is negative, which suggests no real solutions, which can't be right because the chord does intersect.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the segments of the diameter. Let me think again.The diameter is a straight line passing through the center, so if point P is 7 cm from the center, then one segment is 7 cm (from O to P), and the other segment is from P to the other end of the diameter, which is 11 cm (radius) + 7 cm (from P to O) = 18 cm.Wait, that makes more sense. Because the diameter is 22 cm, so from P to the other end is 22 - 7 = 15 cm, but that's not the same as 18 cm.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.The diameter is 22 cm. Point P is 7 cm from the center O. So, from O to P is 7 cm, and from P to the other end of the diameter is 22 - 7 = 15 cm. So, the two segments are 7 cm and 15 cm.Therefore, the product is 7 * 15 = 105.So, AP * PB = 105.But AP + PB = 18 cm, so AP = x, PB = 18 - x.Thus, x(18 - x) = 105Which leads to x² - 18x + 105 = 0But discriminant is 324 - 420 = -96, which is negative. That can't be.Wait, maybe I misapplied the theorem. Let me check the Power of a Point theorem again.The theorem states that if two chords intersect at P, then AP * PB = CP * PD, where CP and PD are the segments of the other chord.In this case, the other chord is the diameter, which is divided into two segments: OP and the other part, which is the entire diameter minus OP.Wait, but OP is 7 cm, and the diameter is 22 cm, so the other segment is 22 - 7 = 15 cm.So, CP * PD = 7 * 15 = 105.Therefore, AP * PB = 105.But AP + PB = 18 cm.So, x(18 - x) = 105Which gives x² - 18x + 105 = 0But discriminant is negative, which is impossible.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the segments of the diameter. Let me think differently.Perhaps the segments are not OP and the rest of the diameter, but rather, since the diameter passes through the center, the segments are OP and the other part from P to the other end, which is 11 cm (radius) + 7 cm = 18 cm.Wait, that would make the segments 7 cm and 18 cm, so the product is 7 * 18 = 126.So, AP * PB = 126.Then, x(18 - x) = 126Which gives x² - 18x + 126 = 0Discriminant: 324 - 504 = -180, still negative.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm misapplying the theorem.Wait, perhaps the segments of the diameter are not OP and the rest, but rather, since the diameter is a straight line, the segments are OP and the other part from P to the other end, which is 11 cm (radius) + 7 cm = 18 cm.Wait, but that would make the segments 7 cm and 18 cm, but the diameter is only 22 cm, so 7 + 18 = 25 cm, which is more than the diameter. That can't be right.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.The diameter is 22 cm. Point P is 7 cm from the center O. So, from O to P is 7 cm, and from P to the other end of the diameter is 22 - 7 = 15 cm.Therefore, the two segments of the diameter are 7 cm and 15 cm.Thus, the product is 7 * 15 = 105.Therefore, AP * PB = 105.But AP + PB = 18 cm.So, x(18 - x) = 105Which gives x² - 18x + 105 = 0But discriminant is negative, which is impossible.Wait, maybe the segments are not 7 cm and 15 cm, but rather, since the diameter passes through the center, the segments are OP and the other part from P to the other end, which is 11 cm (radius) + 7 cm = 18 cm.Wait, but that would make the segments 7 cm and 18 cm, but 7 + 18 = 25 cm, which is more than the diameter of 22 cm. That can't be.Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the segments. Maybe the segments are OP and the other part from P to the other end, which is 11 cm (radius) - 7 cm = 4 cm.Wait, that would make the segments 7 cm and 4 cm, but 7 + 4 = 11 cm, which is less than the diameter. That doesn't make sense either.Wait, I'm really confused now. Let me try to approach this differently.Let me denote the center as O, the chord as AB with length 18 cm, and the diameter intersecting AB at point P, which is 7 cm from O.Let me draw perpendicular lines to visualize this.Since AB is a chord, and OP is the distance from the center to the chord, but wait, in this case, OP is 7 cm, but OP is along the diameter, not necessarily perpendicular to AB.Wait, that's an important point. In the standard formula, the distance from the center to the chord is the perpendicular distance, but in this case, OP is along the diameter, which may not be perpendicular to AB.So, perhaps I need to use the formula for the length of a chord given the distance from the center, but in this case, the distance is along the diameter, not necessarily perpendicular.Wait, that complicates things. Maybe I need to use coordinate geometry.Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place the center O at (0, 0). Let me assume that the diameter is along the x-axis, so the diameter goes from (-11, 0) to (11, 0). Point P is 7 cm from O along the diameter, so P is at (7, 0).Now, the chord AB is intersected by the diameter at P (7, 0), and AB has length 18 cm. We need to find the ratio AP:PB.Let me denote point A as (x1, y1) and point B as (x2, y2). Since AB is a chord of the circle, both A and B lie on the circle, so they satisfy the equation x² + y² = 11² = 121.Also, since AB is a chord intersected by the diameter at P (7, 0), the points A, P, and B are colinear, with P lying between A and B.Let me denote the coordinates of A as (7 + t, y) and B as (7 - t, -y), assuming that AB is symmetric with respect to the diameter. Wait, is that necessarily true? Not necessarily, but perhaps for simplicity, I can assume that AB is symmetric with respect to the diameter, meaning that if A is at (7 + t, y), then B is at (7 - t, -y). This way, the midpoint of AB is P (7, 0).But wait, is that correct? If AB is symmetric with respect to the diameter, then yes, the midpoint would be P. But in reality, AB could be at any angle, not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, since AB is a chord of length 18 cm, and it's intersected by the diameter at P (7, 0), we can use the formula for the length of a chord given the distance from the center.Wait, but the distance from the center to the chord is not necessarily 7 cm because OP is along the diameter, not necessarily perpendicular to AB.So, perhaps I need to find the perpendicular distance from O to AB, and then use that to find the length of AB, but we already know AB is 18 cm.Wait, let me recall the formula for the length of a chord: length = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.Given that AB is 18 cm, and r = 11 cm, we can find d.So, 18 = 2√(11² - d²)Divide both sides by 2: 9 = √(121 - d²)Square both sides: 81 = 121 - d²So, d² = 121 - 81 = 40Thus, d = √40 = 2√10 ≈ 6.324 cmSo, the perpendicular distance from O to AB is approximately 6.324 cm.But in our problem, the distance from O to P along the diameter is 7 cm. So, the distance from O to AB is less than the distance from O to P, which suggests that P is not the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB, but rather, P is a point along the diameter that is 7 cm from O, and the perpendicular distance from O to AB is 6.324 cm.Therefore, the distance from P to AB is the difference between OP and the perpendicular distance, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OPA, where OA is the radius, OP is 7 cm, and PA is half of AB, but no, PA is not necessarily half of AB because P is not the midpoint.Wait, let me think. Let me denote the midpoint of AB as M. Then, OM is the perpendicular distance from O to AB, which we found to be 2√10 cm.Since AB is 18 cm, AM = BM = 9 cm.Now, in triangle OMA, we have OM = 2√10, AM = 9, and OA = 11.So, by Pythagoras: OA² = OM² + AM²11² = (2√10)² + 9²121 = 40 + 81121 = 121, which checks out.Now, point P is on the diameter, 7 cm from O. We need to find the ratio AP:PB.Let me denote the coordinates again. Let me place O at (0, 0), and the diameter along the x-axis. So, P is at (7, 0). The midpoint M of AB is at (h, k), but since AB is perpendicular to OM, and OM is along the y-axis, wait, no, OM is the perpendicular distance, so M is at (0, 2√10) or (0, -2√10). Wait, no, because AB is a chord, and the perpendicular from O to AB is OM, which is 2√10 cm. So, M is at (0, 2√10) or (0, -2√10).But since P is at (7, 0), which is on the x-axis, and AB is a chord intersected by the diameter at P, which is not the midpoint, we need to find the coordinates of A and B such that they lie on the circle, and the line AB passes through P (7, 0).Let me denote the coordinates of A as (x1, y1) and B as (x2, y2). Since AB passes through P (7, 0), the points A, P, and B are colinear.Also, since M is the midpoint of AB, which is at (h, k), and OM is perpendicular to AB, we have that the line AB has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OM.Wait, let me clarify. The slope of OM is (k - 0)/(h - 0) = k/h. Since OM is perpendicular to AB, the slope of AB is -h/k.But since AB passes through P (7, 0), the equation of AB is y - 0 = (-h/k)(x - 7).Also, since M is the midpoint of AB, which is at (h, k), we have that h = (x1 + x2)/2 and k = (y1 + y2)/2.But this seems complicated. Maybe I can use vectors or parametric equations.Alternatively, let me use the concept of similar triangles or coordinate geometry.Since AB is a chord of length 18 cm, and M is the midpoint, which is 2√10 cm from O, we can find the coordinates of M.Wait, if OM is 2√10 cm, and M is the midpoint of AB, then M is at (0, 2√10) or (0, -2√10). But since P is at (7, 0), which is on the x-axis, and AB passes through P, the line AB must pass through both M and P.Wait, but M is the midpoint of AB, so the line AB must pass through M and P. Therefore, the line AB passes through both (0, 2√10) and (7, 0).Thus, we can find the equation of AB.The slope of AB is (0 - 2√10)/(7 - 0) = (-2√10)/7.So, the equation of AB is y = (-2√10/7)x + 2√10.Now, since A and B lie on the circle x² + y² = 121, we can substitute y from the equation of AB into the circle's equation.So, x² + [(-2√10/7 x + 2√10)]² = 121Let me compute this step by step.First, expand [(-2√10/7 x + 2√10)]²:= [(-2√10/7 x) + 2√10]^2= [(-2√10/7 x)]^2 + 2*(-2√10/7 x)*(2√10) + (2√10)^2= (4*10)/49 x² + 2*(-4*10)/7 x + 40= (40/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40Now, substitute back into the circle's equation:x² + (40/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40 = 121Combine like terms:x² + (40/49)x² = (49/49 + 40/49)x² = (89/49)x²So, (89/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40 = 121Subtract 121 from both sides:(89/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40 - 121 = 0Simplify:(89/49)x² - (80/7)x - 81 = 0Multiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:89x² - 560x - 3969 = 0Now, we have a quadratic equation in x:89x² - 560x - 3969 = 0Let me try to solve this using the quadratic formula:x = [560 ± √(560² - 4*89*(-3969))]/(2*89)First, compute the discriminant:560² = 3136004*89*3969 = 4*89*3969Let me compute 89*3969 first:89*3969 = ?Let me compute 89*4000 = 356,000Subtract 89*(4000 - 3969) = 89*31 = 2759So, 356,000 - 2759 = 353,241Now, 4*89*3969 = 4*353,241 = 1,412,964So, the discriminant is:313,600 + 1,412,964 = 1,726,564Now, √1,726,564. Let me see:1,726,564 divided by 4 is 431,641, which is 657² because 650² = 422,500 and 657² = 431,649. Wait, 657² = 431,649, which is close to 431,641. Hmm, maybe it's not a perfect square.Wait, 1,726,564. Let me see:1,726,564 ÷ 4 = 431,641Now, 431,641 ÷ 11 = 39,240.09... Not an integer.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 89*3969.Let me recalculate 89*3969:Compute 89*3000 = 267,00089*900 = 80,10089*69 = 6,141So, total is 267,000 + 80,100 = 347,100 + 6,141 = 353,241Yes, that's correct. So, 4*89*3969 = 1,412,964So, discriminant is 313,600 + 1,412,964 = 1,726,564Now, √1,726,564. Let me see:1,726,564 ÷ 4 = 431,641Now, √431,641. Let me see:657² = 431,649, which is 8 more than 431,641. So, √431,641 is approximately 657 - a little bit.But since we need an exact value, maybe it's not a perfect square. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.We had the equation of AB as y = (-2√10/7)x + 2√10Then, substituting into x² + y² = 121:x² + [(-2√10/7 x + 2√10)]² = 121Expanding the square:= x² + [ (4*10)/49 x² - (8*10)/7 x + 40 ] = 121Wait, 4*10 is 40, so:= x² + (40/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40 = 121Combine x² terms:(1 + 40/49)x² = (89/49)x²So, (89/49)x² - (80/7)x + 40 = 121Subtract 121:(89/49)x² - (80/7)x - 81 = 0Multiply by 49:89x² - 560x - 3969 = 0Yes, that's correct.So, discriminant is 560² + 4*89*3969 = 313,600 + 1,412,964 = 1,726,564√1,726,564. Let me see:1,726,564 ÷ 4 = 431,641Now, 431,641 ÷ 11 = 39,240.09... Not an integer.Wait, maybe I can factor 431,641.Let me try dividing by small primes:431,641 ÷ 7 = 61,663 (since 7*61,663 = 431,641). Wait, 7*60,000 = 420,000, 7*1,663 = 11,641, so total 420,000 + 11,641 = 431,641. Yes, so 431,641 = 7*61,663Now, check if 61,663 is divisible by 7: 7*8,809 = 61,663? 7*8,800 = 61,600, 7*9 = 63, so 61,600 + 63 = 61,663. Yes, so 61,663 = 7*8,809Thus, 431,641 = 7*7*8,809 = 49*8,809Now, check if 8,809 is a square. √8,809 ≈ 94, since 94² = 8,836, which is close. 93² = 8,649, 94² = 8,836, so no, not a perfect square.Thus, √431,641 = 7*√8,809 ≈ 7*94 ≈ 658But since it's not a perfect square, the discriminant is not a perfect square, meaning the solutions for x are irrational.But this seems messy. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates. Let me try a different approach.Since AB is a chord of length 18 cm, and the distance from the center to AB is 2√10 cm, as we found earlier.Now, point P is on the diameter, 7 cm from O. We need to find the ratio AP:PB.Let me denote AP = x and PB = 18 - x.We can use the formula for the length of a chord segment given the distance from the center.Wait, but since P is not the midpoint, we need to use the formula for the length of the chord segments when the chord is intersected by a line at a certain distance from the center.I recall that if a chord of length 2a is intersected by a line at distance d from the center, then the lengths of the segments are given by:AP = √(r² - d² + (distance along the line)^2)Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, we can use coordinate geometry again, but perhaps more carefully.Let me place O at (0, 0), diameter along x-axis, P at (7, 0). The chord AB passes through P and has length 18 cm.Let me denote the coordinates of A as (7 + t, y) and B as (7 - t, -y), assuming symmetry about the x-axis. Wait, but AB is a chord, so if it's symmetric about the x-axis, then the midpoint would be P, but in reality, P is not necessarily the midpoint.Wait, no, if AB is symmetric about the x-axis, then the midpoint would be on the x-axis, which is P. But in our case, P is 7 cm from O, and the midpoint M of AB is at a distance of 2√10 cm from O, which is approximately 6.324 cm. So, M is not P, but another point.Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to use the formula for the ratio in which a chord is divided by a point on the diameter.I recall that if a chord AB is intersected by a diameter at point P, which is at a distance p from the center, then the ratio AP:PB is given by (r + p):(r - p), where r is the radius.Wait, let me check this formula.If we have a circle with radius r, and a chord AB intersected by a diameter at P, which is p units from the center, then the ratio AP:PB is (r + p):(r - p).Let me verify this.Consider the right triangle formed by O, M (midpoint of AB), and A.We have OM = d = √(r² - (AB/2)²) = √(121 - 81) = √40 = 2√10 cm.Now, point P is on the diameter at distance p = 7 cm from O.We can use similar triangles or coordinate geometry to find the ratio.Alternatively, using the formula for the ratio:AP:PB = (r + p):(r - p) = (11 + 7):(11 - 7) = 18:4 = 9:2Wait, but this contradicts the earlier attempt where I got a quadratic with negative discriminant.Wait, maybe this formula is correct. Let me see.If AP:PB = (r + p):(r - p), then AP = (r + p)/(r - p) * PBBut AP + PB = 18 cmSo, let me denote PB = x, then AP = (18/4)x = (9/2)xWait, no, AP = (18/4)x? Wait, no, AP:PB = 18:4 = 9:2, so AP = (9/2)PBSo, AP = (9/2)PBBut AP + PB = 18So, (9/2)PB + PB = 18(11/2)PB = 18PB = (18 * 2)/11 = 36/11 ≈ 3.27 cmAP = 18 - 36/11 = (198 - 36)/11 = 162/11 ≈ 14.73 cmSo, the ratio AP:PB is 162/11 : 36/11 = 162:36 = 9:2Wait, that seems reasonable. So, the ratio is 9:2.But earlier, when I tried using the Power of a Point theorem, I got a negative discriminant, which suggests that my application of the theorem was incorrect.Wait, perhaps I misapplied the theorem because the segments of the diameter are not OP and the rest, but rather, the entire diameter is considered, and the segments are OP and the other part from P to the end, which is 15 cm.So, AP * PB = OP * (diameter segment) = 7 * 15 = 105But AP + PB = 18So, x(18 - x) = 105x² - 18x + 105 = 0Discriminant: 324 - 420 = -96Negative discriminant, which is impossible.But according to the formula, the ratio is 9:2, which gives AP ≈14.73 cm and PB ≈3.27 cm, which sum to 18 cm.So, where is the mistake?Wait, perhaps the formula I recalled is incorrect. Let me derive it.Consider the circle with center O, radius r, chord AB of length 2a, intersected by diameter at P, which is p units from O.We need to find the ratio AP:PB.Let me denote AP = x, PB = 2a - x.Using the Power of a Point theorem, AP * PB = OP * (diameter segment)But the diameter segment is from P to the other end, which is 2r - p.So, AP * PB = p * (2r - p)Thus, x(2a - x) = p(2r - p)But we also know that the length of the chord AB is 2a = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the perpendicular distance from O to AB.Wait, but in our case, we have AB = 18 cm, so a = 9 cm.Thus, 9 = √(121 - d²)So, d² = 121 - 81 = 40, d = 2√10 cm.Now, using the formula:x(18 - x) = 7*(22 - 7) = 7*15 = 105So, x² - 18x + 105 = 0Which has discriminant 324 - 420 = -96, which is negative.This suggests that there is no real solution, which contradicts the formula I recalled earlier.Wait, perhaps the formula I recalled is incorrect. Let me try to derive the ratio.Let me consider the coordinates again. Let me place O at (0, 0), P at (p, 0) = (7, 0). The chord AB passes through P and has length 18 cm.Let me denote the coordinates of A as (x1, y1) and B as (x2, y2). Since AB passes through P, the points A, P, B are colinear.The midpoint M of AB is at ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). The line OM is perpendicular to AB.The slope of AB is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). The slope of OM is [(y1 + y2)/2 - 0]/[(x1 + x2)/2 - 0] = (y1 + y2)/(x1 + x2)Since AB and OM are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:[(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)] * [(y1 + y2)/(x1 + x2)] = -1This seems complicated. Maybe I can use vectors.Alternatively, let me use the concept of similar triangles.Since OM is perpendicular to AB, and P lies on AB, we can use the formula for the ratio in which P divides AB.Let me denote the ratio AP:PB = k:1Then, AP = k * PBSince AP + PB = 18, we have k * PB + PB = 18 => PB = 18/(k + 1), AP = 18k/(k + 1)Now, using the formula for the distance from O to AB, which is d = 2√10 cm.We can use the formula that relates the distance from the center to the chord, the length of the chord, and the ratio in which a point divides the chord.I recall that if a chord is divided by a point at a distance p from the center, then the ratio is given by (r + p):(r - p)Wait, let me check this.If we have a chord AB, and a point P on AB such that OP = p, then the ratio AP:PB = (r + p):(r - p)Wait, let me verify this with the formula.Using the formula for the ratio:AP:PB = (r + p):(r - p)So, AP = (r + p)/(r - p) * PBBut AP + PB = AB = 18So, (r + p)/(r - p) * PB + PB = 18PB [ (r + p)/(r - p) + 1 ] = 18PB [ (r + p + r - p)/(r - p) ] = 18PB [ (2r)/(r - p) ] = 18Thus, PB = 18(r - p)/(2r) = 9(r - p)/rSimilarly, AP = 18 - PB = 18 - 9(r - p)/r = 9(r + p)/rThus, the ratio AP:PB = [9(r + p)/r] : [9(r - p)/r] = (r + p):(r - p)So, in our case, r = 11, p = 7Thus, AP:PB = (11 + 7):(11 - 7) = 18:4 = 9:2Therefore, the ratio is 9:2So, despite the earlier confusion with the Power of a Point theorem, the correct ratio is 9:2.I think the mistake earlier was in misapplying the Power of a Point theorem because the segments of the diameter are not OP and the rest, but rather, the entire diameter is considered, and the segments are OP and the other part from P to the end, which is 15 cm, leading to a negative discriminant, which suggests that the theorem was misapplied in this context.Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:2."},{"question":"Compute the limit of the function:[lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{arcsin 2 x}{sin 3(x+pi)}]","answer":"Okay, so I have this limit to compute: the limit as x approaches 0 of arcsin(2x) divided by sin(3(x + π)). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving trigonometric functions, sometimes it's helpful to use known limits or properties of these functions. I also recall that for small angles, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x, and sin(x) is approximately equal to x. Maybe I can use these approximations here.But before I jump into approximations, let me look at the denominator: sin(3(x + π)). I can simplify this expression a bit. Using the sine addition formula, sin(a + b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b). So, sin(3x + 3π). Wait, 3π is the same as π + 2π, and since sine has a period of 2π, sin(3x + 3π) is the same as sin(3x + π). Now, sin(3x + π) can be simplified further using the identity sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ). So, sin(3x + π) = -sin(3x). That means the denominator becomes -sin(3x). So, the original limit simplifies to the limit as x approaches 0 of arcsin(2x) divided by -sin(3x).Okay, so now the expression is:lim(x→0) [arcsin(2x) / (-sin(3x))]I can factor out the negative sign:- lim(x→0) [arcsin(2x) / sin(3x)]Now, I need to evaluate this limit. I remember that for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x, and sin(x) is approximately equal to x. So, maybe I can use these approximations for the numerator and the denominator.Let me write that out:arcsin(2x) ≈ 2x when x is near 0.Similarly, sin(3x) ≈ 3x when x is near 0.So, substituting these approximations into the limit, I get:- lim(x→0) [2x / 3x]Simplify the x terms:- lim(x→0) [2/3]Since 2/3 is a constant, the limit as x approaches 0 is just -2/3.Wait, let me double-check that. I used the approximations for arcsin and sin, which are valid for small x. So, as x approaches 0, these approximations should hold. Also, I correctly simplified the denominator using the sine addition formula and the periodicity of sine. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using L’Hospital’s Rule since both the numerator and denominator approach 0 as x approaches 0. Let me try that to verify.So, applying L’Hospital’s Rule, I need to differentiate the numerator and the denominator with respect to x.The derivative of arcsin(2x) is (2) / sqrt(1 - (2x)^2).The derivative of sin(3(x + π)) is 3cos(3(x + π)).So, the limit becomes:lim(x→0) [ (2 / sqrt(1 - (2x)^2)) / (3cos(3(x + π))) ]Simplify this expression:= lim(x→0) [2 / (3 sqrt(1 - 4x^2) cos(3x + 3π))]Now, evaluate at x = 0:sqrt(1 - 0) = 1.cos(3*0 + 3π) = cos(3π) = -1.So, substituting these values in:= [2 / (3 * 1 * (-1))] = -2/3.Okay, so using L’Hospital’s Rule also gives me -2/3. That confirms my earlier result.I think I'm confident now that the limit is -2/3."},{"question":"There is a full jug of milk with a capacity of 8 liters and two empty jugs with capacities of 5 liters and 3 liters. How can you divide the milk into two equal parts?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's an 8-liter jug full of milk, and two smaller jugs that are empty—one is 5 liters and the other is 3 liters. The goal is to divide the milk into two equal parts, which would mean having 4 liters in each part. Hmm, that sounds like a classic water jug problem, but with milk instead. I remember these kinds of puzzles from before, where you have to pour water between different-sized containers to measure out specific amounts.Alright, let's start by visualizing the initial state. I have an 8-liter jug that's full, so that's 8 liters of milk. The other two jugs are empty, so they have 0 liters each. My goal is to get 4 liters in two of the jugs. Since the 8-liter jug is the largest, I might need to use it as a source to fill the smaller jugs and then transfer milk between them to measure out the 4 liters.First, I think I should pour milk from the 8-liter jug into one of the smaller jugs. Let's choose the 5-liter jug first because it's larger than the 3-liter jug. So, I pour milk from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until the 5-liter jug is full. Now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters left (because 8 minus 5 is 3), the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug is still empty.Next, I can pour milk from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. The 3-liter jug can only hold 3 liters, so after pouring, the 5-liter jug will have 2 liters left (5 minus 3), and the 3-liter jug will be full with 3 liters. So now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters, the 5-liter jug has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 3 liters.Now, I can pour the milk from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug. This will empty the 3-liter jug, and the 8-liter jug will now have 6 liters (3 plus 3). The 5-liter jug still has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty again.Next, I can pour milk from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, and the 3-liter jug can take 3 liters, so after pouring, the 8-liter jug will have 3 liters left, the 5-liter jug still has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Now, I can pour milk from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. The 5-liter jug currently has 2 liters, so it can take 3 more liters to be full. After pouring, the 5-liter jug will be full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug will be empty. So now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters, the 5-liter jug has 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.I can pour the milk from the 5-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug. The 8-liter jug currently has 3 liters, so it can take 5 more liters to be full. After pouring, the 8-liter jug will be full with 8 liters, and the 5-liter jug will be empty.Now, I can pour milk from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 8 liters, and the 3-liter jug can take 3 liters, so after pouring, the 8-liter jug will have 5 liters left, the 5-liter jug is still empty, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Next, I can pour milk from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. The 5-liter jug is empty, so it can take all 3 liters from the 3-liter jug. After pouring, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.Now, I can pour milk from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug can take 3 liters, so after pouring, the 8-liter jug will have 2 liters left, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, I can pour milk from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. The 5-liter jug currently has 3 liters, so it can take 2 more liters to be full. After pouring, the 5-liter jug will be full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug will have 1 liter left (since 3 minus 2 is 1).Wait, that doesn't seem right. I was supposed to get 4 liters in each part, but now the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 8-liter jug has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 1 liter. That's not equal. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.Let me try a different approach. Starting over, I have the 8-liter jug full, and the other two empty. I'll pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, which already has 3 liters. But wait, the 3-liter jug can only hold 3 liters, so I can't pour any more into it. This seems like a dead end.Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's try again. Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.Wait, maybe I need to think outside the box. What if I use the 3-liter jug to measure out exactly 4 liters? Let me try that. Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 5 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. Now, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 2 liters, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Then, pour from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full.

The 3-liter jug can take 3 liters, so pouring 3 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 2 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters, the 5-liter jug has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs. Maybe I need to repeat some steps.

The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to think differently. What if I use the 5-liter jug to measure out 4 liters? Let me try that. Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.Wait, maybe I need to think about the fact that the 8-liter jug is the only one that can hold exactly 4 liters when halved. So, if I can get the 8-liter jug to have 4 liters, and the other jugs to have the remaining 4 liters, that would solve the problem. Let me try that.Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try a different approach altogether. Let me think about the capacities. The 8-liter jug can be split into two 4-liter parts. The 5-liter and 3-liter jugs can be used to measure out these parts. Maybe I can use the 5-liter jug to hold 4 liters and the 3-liter jug to hold the remaining 4 liters.Wait, the 3-liter jug can't hold 4 liters. So, that won't work. Maybe I need to use the 8-liter jug and the 5-liter jug to hold the 4 liters each. Let me try that. Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try a different sequence of pours. Let me start over and try to find a way to get exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs.Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 5 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. Now, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 2 liters, the 5-liter jug has 3 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Then, pour from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 5-liter jug can take 2 more liters to be full, so pouring 2 liters from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug leaves the 3-liter jug with 1 liter. Now, the 8-liter jug has 2 liters, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 1 liter.Next, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 3-liter jug into the 8-liter jug, which now has 3 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters, the 5-liter jug has 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.Finally, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 3 liters, so pouring 3 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 2 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 3 liters, the 5-liter jug has 2 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs. Maybe I need to repeat some steps. Let's try again. Start with the 8-liter jug full. Pour into the 5-liter jug until it's full, leaving 3 liters in the 8-liter jug. Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter jug. Now, pour the 3 liters from the 3-liter jug back into the 8-liter jug, which now has 6 liters. Then, pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 6 liters, the 5-liter jug is empty, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Next, pour from the 8-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until it's full. The 8-liter jug has 6 liters, so it can pour 5 liters into the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 8-liter jug. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug is full with 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug has 2 liters.Then, pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until it's full. The 3-liter jug can take 1 more liter to be full, so pouring 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug leaves the 5-liter jug with 4 liters. Now, the 8-liter jug has 1 liter, the 5-liter jug has 4 liters, and the 3-liter jug is full with 3 liters.Finally, pour the remaining 1 liter from the 8-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, but the 3-liter jug is already full, so I can't pour anymore. This still doesn't give me 4 liters in two jugs.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently. Let me try to visualize the steps again.Start with (8, 0, 0). Pour from 8 to 5, getting (3, 5, 0). Then pour from 5 to 3, getting (3, 2, 3). Pour from 3 to 8, getting (6, 2, 0). Pour from 8 to 3, getting (3, 2, 3). Pour from 3 to 5, getting (3, 5, 0). Pour from 5 to 8, getting (8, 0, 0). Pour from 8 to 3, getting (5, 0, 3). Pour from 3 to 5, getting (5, 3, 0). Pour from 8 to 3, getting (2, 3, 3). Pour from 3 to 5, getting (2, 6, 0). Pour from 5 to 8, getting (8, 0, 0). Pour from 8 to 5, getting (3, 5, 0). Pour from 5 to 3, getting (3, 2, 3). Pour from 3 to 8, getting (6, 2, 0). Pour from 8 to 5, getting (1, 5, 0). Pour from 5 to 3, getting (1, 4, 3). Pour from 3 to 8, getting (4, 4, 0).Ah, there we go! By following these steps, I end up with 4 liters in the 8-liter jug and 4 liters in the 5-liter jug. So, the final state is (4, 4, 0), which means the milk is divided into two equal parts of 4 liters each."},{"question":"If the range of the function f(x)=left{begin{array}{l}-2{x^2}+ax-2,x≤1 x-1,x＞1end{array}right. is R, then the range of the real number a is ()A: left[-4,5right]B: left[-4,4right]C: (-infty ,-4]cup left[5,+infty right)D: (-infty ,-4]cup left[4,+infty right)","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's -2x² + ax - 2 when x is less than or equal to 1, and it's x - 1 when x is greater than 1. The problem says that the range of this function is all real numbers, which is R. I need to find the range of the real number a that makes this true. The options are given as A, B, C, D.First, I should probably sketch or understand what each piece of the function looks like. For x > 1, the function is x - 1, which is a straight line with a slope of 1, starting from (1, 0) and going upwards. So as x increases beyond 1, f(x) increases without bound. That means for x > 1, f(x) can take any value from 0 to infinity.Now, for x ≤ 1, the function is a quadratic: -2x² + ax - 2. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), this parabola opens downward. So it has a maximum point at its vertex. The range of this quadratic part will be from negative infinity up to the maximum value at the vertex.But wait, the overall range of the entire function is supposed to be all real numbers. That means for the function to cover all real numbers, the quadratic part must cover all the negative values and up to some maximum, and the linear part covers all the positive values. But since the linear part already covers from 0 to infinity, the quadratic part needs to cover from negative infinity up to at least 0, right? Because if the quadratic part only goes up to, say, 5, then the function f(x) would miss the values between 5 and infinity, but actually, the linear part already covers that. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, no. The linear part covers from 0 to infinity, so the quadratic part needs to cover from negative infinity up to some maximum value. But for the entire function's range to be all real numbers, the quadratic part's maximum must be at least as high as the starting point of the linear part, which is 0. Otherwise, there would be a gap between the maximum of the quadratic and the linear part, meaning some values in between wouldn't be covered.So, the maximum value of the quadratic part must be greater than or equal to 0. That way, the quadratic covers from negative infinity up to at least 0, and the linear part covers from 0 to infinity, making the entire range R.So, I need to find the maximum value of the quadratic function -2x² + ax - 2 and set it to be greater than or equal to 0.The vertex of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, the quadratic is -2x² + ax - 2, so a_quad = -2, b_quad = a. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -a/(2*(-2)) = a/4.So, the vertex is at x = a/4. Now, I need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is the maximum value of the quadratic.Plugging x = a/4 into the quadratic:f(a/4) = -2*(a/4)² + a*(a/4) - 2Let me compute that step by step.First, (a/4)² is a²/16.Multiply by -2: -2*(a²/16) = -a²/8.Next, a*(a/4) is a²/4.So, putting it all together:f(a/4) = (-a²/8) + (a²/4) - 2Combine like terms:(-a²/8 + 2a²/8) - 2 = (a²/8) - 2So, the maximum value of the quadratic is (a²)/8 - 2.We need this maximum value to be greater than or equal to 0 for the quadratic part to cover up to 0, ensuring the entire function's range is R.So, set up the inequality:(a²)/8 - 2 ≥ 0Multiply both sides by 8:a² - 16 ≥ 0Which simplifies to:a² ≥ 16Taking square roots on both sides:|a| ≥ 4Which means a ≥ 4 or a ≤ -4.Therefore, the range of a is (-∞, -4] ∪ [4, ∞), which corresponds to option D.Wait, let me double-check. If a is between -4 and 4, then the maximum value of the quadratic would be less than 0, meaning the quadratic only goes up to a negative number, and the linear part starts at 0. So, there would be a gap between that negative maximum and 0, meaning the function's range wouldn't cover all real numbers. So, to have the quadratic's maximum at least 0, a must be outside of (-4, 4). So, yes, a must be ≤ -4 or ≥ 4.Therefore, the correct answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The line y = frac{5}{3} x - frac{17}{3} is to be parameterized using vectors.

There are five options provided, labeled (A) through (E), and I need to determine which of these are valid parameterizations of the line.First, I recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form typically looks like:[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = mathbf{v} + t mathbf{d}]where ( mathbf{v} ) is a specific point on the line, and ( mathbf{d} ) is a direction vector that indicates the direction of the line. The parameter ( t ) can be any real number.So, to verify if each option is a valid parameterization, I need to check two things:1. Does the point ( mathbf{v} ) lie on the line ( y = frac{5}{3}x - frac{17}{3} )?2. Is the direction vector ( mathbf{d} ) a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the given line?First, let's find the direction vector of the given line. The equation is in slope-intercept form, ( y = mx + b ), where ( m ) is the slope. Here, the slope ( m = frac{5}{3} ). The direction vector can be found from the slope. If the slope is ( frac{5}{3} ), then the direction vector is ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ) because the change in y over the change in x is ( frac{5}{3} ).Alternatively, any scalar multiple of ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ) can also be a direction vector for the line.Now, let's go through each option one by one.**Option (A):**[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 4  1 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} -3  -5 end{pmatrix}]First, check if the point ( begin{pmatrix} 4  1 end{pmatrix} ) lies on the line. Plugging ( x = 4 ) into the line equation:[y = frac{5}{3}(4) - frac{17}{3} = frac{20}{3} - frac{17}{3} = frac{3}{3} = 1]So, yes, the point ( (4, 1) ) is on the line.Next, check the direction vector ( begin{pmatrix} -3  -5 end{pmatrix} ). This is just ( -1 ) times the direction vector ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ), so it's a scalar multiple. Therefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.**Option (B):**[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 17  5 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 6  10 end{pmatrix}]Check if the point ( begin{pmatrix} 17  5 end{pmatrix} ) lies on the line. Plug ( x = 17 ) into the line equation:[y = frac{5}{3}(17) - frac{17}{3} = frac{85}{3} - frac{17}{3} = frac{68}{3} approx 22.67]But the y-coordinate given is 5, which is not equal to ( frac{68}{3} ). Therefore, the point ( (17, 5) ) does not lie on the line, making option (B) invalid.**Option (C):**[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 2  -frac{7}{3} end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} frac{3}{5}  1 end{pmatrix}]First, check if the point ( begin{pmatrix} 2  -frac{7}{3} end{pmatrix} ) lies on the line. Plug ( x = 2 ) into the line equation:[y = frac{5}{3}(2) - frac{17}{3} = frac{10}{3} - frac{17}{3} = -frac{7}{3}]So, yes, the point ( (2, -frac{7}{3}) ) is on the line.Next, check the direction vector ( begin{pmatrix} frac{3}{5}  1 end{pmatrix} ). To see if it's a scalar multiple of ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ), let's see if there's a scalar ( k ) such that:[begin{pmatrix} frac{3}{5}  1 end{pmatrix} = k begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix}]This would mean:[frac{3}{5} = 3k quad text{and} quad 1 = 5k]From the first equation, ( k = frac{3}{5} div 3 = frac{1}{5} ). From the second equation, ( k = frac{1}{5} ). Since both give the same ( k ), it is a scalar multiple. Therefore, option (C) is valid.**Option (D):**[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} frac{14}{5}  -1 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 1  frac{3}{5} end{pmatrix}]Check if the point ( begin{pmatrix} frac{14}{5}  -1 end{pmatrix} ) lies on the line. Plug ( x = frac{14}{5} ) into the line equation:[y = frac{5}{3} left( frac{14}{5} right) - frac{17}{3} = frac{14}{3} - frac{17}{3} = -frac{3}{3} = -1]So, yes, the point ( left( frac{14}{5}, -1 right) ) is on the line.Next, check the direction vector ( begin{pmatrix} 1  frac{3}{5} end{pmatrix} ). Let's see if it's a scalar multiple of ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ). Suppose:[begin{pmatrix} 1  frac{3}{5} end{pmatrix} = k begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix}]This gives:[1 = 3k quad text{and} quad frac{3}{5} = 5k]From the first equation, ( k = frac{1}{3} ). From the second equation, ( k = frac{3}{5} div 5 = frac{3}{25} ). Since ( frac{1}{3} neq frac{3}{25} ), it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, option (D) is invalid.**Option (E):**[begin{pmatrix} x  y end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 0  -frac{17}{3} end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 15  -25 end{pmatrix}]First, check if the point ( begin{pmatrix} 0  -frac{17}{3} end{pmatrix} ) lies on the line. Plug ( x = 0 ) into the line equation:[y = frac{5}{3}(0) - frac{17}{3} = -frac{17}{3}]So, yes, the point ( (0, -frac{17}{3}) ) is on the line.Next, check the direction vector ( begin{pmatrix} 15  -25 end{pmatrix} ). Let's see if it's a scalar multiple of ( begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix} ). Suppose:[begin{pmatrix} 15  -25 end{pmatrix} = k begin{pmatrix} 3  5 end{pmatrix}]This gives:[15 = 3k quad text{and} quad -25 = 5k]From the first equation, ( k = 5 ). From the second equation, ( k = -5 ). Since ( 5 neq -5 ), it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, option (E) is invalid.**Summary:**- Option (A): Valid- Option (B): Invalid- Option (C): Valid- Option (D): Invalid- Option (E): InvalidSo, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C)."},{"question":"a, b, and c rent a pasture.

Find the largest possible value of x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible value of ( x ) given that ( x + y + z = 6 ) and ( xy + xz + yz = 11 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with sums and products of variables, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric equations or maybe even think about quadratic equations. Since there are three variables, maybe I can express two of them in terms of the third and then solve for the maximum.Let me write down the given equations:1. ( x + y + z = 6 )2. ( xy + xz + yz = 11 )I need to find the maximum value of ( x ). Maybe I can express ( y ) and ( z ) in terms of ( x ) and then substitute into the second equation.From the first equation, if I solve for ( y + z ), I get:( y + z = 6 - x )Similarly, the second equation can be rewritten in terms of ( x ). Let's see:( xy + xz + yz = 11 )Notice that ( xy + xz = x(y + z) ). So, substituting ( y + z = 6 - x ), we have:( x(6 - x) + yz = 11 )So, ( yz = 11 - x(6 - x) )Simplify that:( yz = 11 - 6x + x^2 )Alright, so now I have expressions for ( y + z ) and ( yz ) in terms of ( x ). This reminds me of the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation. If ( y ) and ( z ) are roots of a quadratic, then the quadratic can be written as:( t^2 - (y + z)t + yz = 0 )Substituting the expressions we have:( t^2 - (6 - x)t + (11 - 6x + x^2) = 0 )So, the quadratic equation is:( t^2 - (6 - x)t + (11 - 6x + x^2) = 0 )Now, for ( y ) and ( z ) to be real numbers, the discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:( D = [-(6 - x)]^2 - 4 times 1 times (11 - 6x + x^2) )Simplify the discriminant:First, square ( (6 - x) ):( (6 - x)^2 = 36 - 12x + x^2 )Then, compute ( 4 times (11 - 6x + x^2) ):( 4 times 11 = 44 )( 4 times (-6x) = -24x )( 4 times x^2 = 4x^2 )So, altogether, it's ( 44 - 24x + 4x^2 )Now, subtract this from the squared term:( D = (36 - 12x + x^2) - (44 - 24x + 4x^2) )Let me distribute the negative sign:( D = 36 - 12x + x^2 - 44 + 24x - 4x^2 )Combine like terms:- Constants: ( 36 - 44 = -8 )- ( x ) terms: ( -12x + 24x = 12x )- ( x^2 ) terms: ( x^2 - 4x^2 = -3x^2 )So, the discriminant simplifies to:( D = -3x^2 + 12x - 8 )For the quadratic to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero:( -3x^2 + 12x - 8 geq 0 )Hmm, let's solve this inequality. It's a quadratic inequality. First, let me write it as:( -3x^2 + 12x - 8 geq 0 )I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of ( x^2 ) positive, but I have to reverse the inequality sign:( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 leq 0 )Now, let's solve the quadratic equation ( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 = 0 ) to find the critical points.Using the quadratic formula:( x = frac{12 pm sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4 times 3 times 8}}{2 times 3} )Calculate the discriminant inside the square root:( (-12)^2 = 144 )( 4 times 3 times 8 = 96 )So, ( 144 - 96 = 48 )Thus,( x = frac{12 pm sqrt{48}}{6} )Simplify ( sqrt{48} ):( sqrt{48} = sqrt{16 times 3} = 4sqrt{3} )So,( x = frac{12 pm 4sqrt{3}}{6} )Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 2:( x = frac{6 pm 2sqrt{3}}{3} )Which simplifies further to:( x = 2 pm frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )So, the critical points are ( x = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( x = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Since the quadratic ( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 ) opens upwards (coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), the inequality ( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 leq 0 ) holds between the two roots.Therefore, the solution is:( 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} leq x leq 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )So, the maximum value of ( x ) is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my steps because earlier in the thought process, I thought the maximum was 2, but now I'm getting a different value.Wait, no, actually, in the initial steps, I used Cauchy-Schwarz and got a different result, but now, by expressing ( y ) and ( z ) as roots of a quadratic, I'm getting a different maximum. Which one is correct?Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cauchy-Schwarz approach. Let me go back and check.In the Cauchy-Schwarz approach, I started by squaring the sum:( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) = 36 )Given ( xy + xz + yz = 11 ), so:( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 36 - 22 = 14 )Then, I applied Cauchy-Schwarz:( (1^2 + 1^2)(y^2 + z^2) geq (y + z)^2 )Which simplifies to:( 2(y^2 + z^2) geq (6 - x)^2 )Since ( y^2 + z^2 = 14 - x^2 ), substituting:( 2(14 - x^2) geq (6 - x)^2 )Expanding both sides:Left side: ( 28 - 2x^2 )Right side: ( 36 - 12x + x^2 )So, bringing all terms to one side:( 28 - 2x^2 - 36 + 12x - x^2 geq 0 )Simplify:( -3x^2 + 12x - 8 geq 0 )Which is the same inequality as before, just multiplied by -1:( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 leq 0 )So, the roots are ( 2 pm frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ), and the inequality holds between them.Therefore, the maximum value of ( x ) is indeed ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Wait, but in the initial Cauchy-Schwarz approach, I thought the maximum was 2. That must have been a mistake.So, the correct maximum value is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ). Let me compute this value numerically to get a sense.( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 ), so ( 2sqrt{3} approx 3.464 ). Divided by 3, that's approximately 1.1547.So, ( 2 + 1.1547 approx 3.1547 ).Wait, but if ( x ) is approximately 3.1547, then ( y + z = 6 - x approx 2.8453 ), and ( yz = 11 - x(6 - x) ).Let me compute ( yz ):( yz = 11 - x(6 - x) = 11 - 6x + x^2 )Substituting ( x = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ):First, compute ( x = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Compute ( x^2 ):( (2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3})^2 = 4 + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{12}{9} = 4 + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{4}{3} = frac{12}{3} + frac{4}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{16}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Compute ( 6x ):( 6 times (2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = 12 + 4sqrt{3} )So, ( yz = 11 - (12 + 4sqrt{3}) + (frac{16}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}) )Simplify:Convert 11 to thirds: ( 11 = frac{33}{3} )So,( yz = frac{33}{3} - 12 - 4sqrt{3} + frac{16}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Convert 12 to thirds: ( 12 = frac{36}{3} )So,( yz = frac{33}{3} - frac{36}{3} - 4sqrt{3} + frac{16}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Combine the fractions:( frac{33 - 36 + 16}{3} = frac{13}{3} )Combine the square roots:( -4sqrt{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} = -frac{12sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} = -frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )So, ( yz = frac{13}{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )So, ( yz ) is positive because ( frac{13}{3} approx 4.333 ) and ( frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} approx 2.309 ), so ( 4.333 - 2.309 approx 2.024 ), which is positive. Therefore, ( y ) and ( z ) are real numbers.Therefore, the maximum value of ( x ) is indeed ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Wait, but earlier I thought the maximum was 2. That must have been incorrect. So, the correct maximum is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Alternatively, this can be written as ( frac{6 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{2(3 + sqrt{3})}{3} = frac{2}{3}(3 + sqrt{3}) ), but the simplest form is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).So, to write it neatly, ( x = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).But let me check if this is indeed the maximum.Suppose ( x = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ), then ( y + z = 6 - x = 6 - 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = 4 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).And ( yz = 11 - x(6 - x) = 11 - (2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3})(4 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) ).Let me compute this:First, multiply ( (2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3})(4 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) ):Multiply 2 by 4: 8Multiply 2 by ( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ): ( -frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )Multiply ( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) by 4: ( frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Multiply ( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) by ( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ): ( -frac{4 times 3}{9} = -frac{12}{9} = -frac{4}{3} )So, adding all these up:8 - ( frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} ) + ( frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} ) - ( frac{4}{3} )Combine like terms:Constants: 8 - ( frac{4}{3} = frac{24}{3} - frac{4}{3} = frac{20}{3} )Square roots: ( -frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )So, total is ( frac{20}{3} + frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )Therefore, ( yz = 11 - (frac{20}{3} + frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}) )Convert 11 to thirds: ( 11 = frac{33}{3} )So,( yz = frac{33}{3} - frac{20}{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{13}{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} )Which is the same as before. So, yes, ( yz ) is positive, so ( y ) and ( z ) are real.Therefore, the maximum value of ( x ) is indeed ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Wait, but let me think again. When I used Cauchy-Schwarz, I ended up with the same quadratic inequality, so both methods agree. So, why did I initially think the maximum was 2? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Cauchy-Schwarz result.Looking back at the Cauchy-Schwarz approach:After simplifying, I had:( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 leq 0 )Which factors as:( (3x - 4)(x - 2) leq 0 )Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try to factor ( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 ).Looking for two numbers that multiply to ( 3 times 8 = 24 ) and add up to -12.Hmm, -6 and -4: (-6) * (-4) = 24, (-6) + (-4) = -10, which is not -12.Wait, maybe it's not factorable with integers. So, perhaps I should have used the quadratic formula instead of trying to factor it.Indeed, as I did earlier, the roots are ( 2 pm frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ), so the quadratic doesn't factor nicely with integers. Therefore, my initial attempt to factor it as ( (x - 2)(3x - 4) ) was incorrect because that would give ( 3x^2 - 10x + 8 ), which is different from ( 3x^2 - 12x + 8 ).So, that was a mistake. Therefore, the correct roots are ( 2 pm frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ), and the maximum value of ( x ) is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Therefore, the largest possible value of ( x ) is ( 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).I think that's the correct answer now. Initially, I thought it was 2 because of a factoring mistake, but upon correctly solving the quadratic, the maximum is indeed higher than 2."},{"question":"Note that 8^2 = 64, which contains no zeros; 88^2 = 7744, which contains no zeros; and 888^2 = 788,!944, which contains 1 zero. Assuming this pattern continues, how many zeros are in the expansion of 88,!888,!888^2?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how many zeros are in the square of the number 88,888,888. The problem gives me some examples to start with:- 8 squared is 64, which has no zeros.- 88 squared is 7744, which also has no zeros.- 888 squared is 788,944, which has 1 zero.It then asks me to assume this pattern continues and figure out how many zeros are in 88,888,888 squared.Alright, let me try to understand the pattern here. The numbers given are all made up of multiple 8s:- 8 (one 8)- 88 (two 8s)- 888 (three 8s)And when each of these is squared, the number of zeros in the result seems to follow a certain pattern. For one 8, there are no zeros. For two 8s, still no zeros. For three 8s, there's one zero. So, maybe the number of zeros increases as the number of 8s increases?Let me test this with the next number in the sequence. If I take 8888 (four 8s) and square it, how many zeros would there be? Let me calculate that.First, 8888 squared. Hmm, 8888 times 8888. I might need to do this step by step.But wait, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of calculating each time. The problem mentions that 88,888,888 is 10^8 - 1^8. Wait, is that correct?Let me check: 10^8 is 100,000,000. 1^8 is 1. So, 100,000,000 - 1 is 99,999,999. But 88,888,888 is not 99,999,999. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to express it.Wait, perhaps it's 10^8 - 11111111? Let me see: 100,000,000 - 11,111,111 is 88,888,889. That's close but not exactly 88,888,888. Maybe it's 10^8 - 11111112? No, that's complicating things.Maybe I should think of 88,888,888 as 8 times 11,111,111. Because 11,111,111 times 8 is 88,888,888. So, 88,888,888 = 8 * 11,111,111.If I square that, it would be (8 * 11,111,111)^2 = 64 * (11,111,111)^2. Hmm, maybe that helps? I'm not sure yet.Alternatively, maybe I can think of 88,888,888 as a number with eight 8s. So, each additional 8 adds a certain number of zeros when squared. From the examples:- 8 (1 eight) squared: 64 (0 zeros)- 88 (2 eights) squared: 7744 (0 zeros)- 888 (3 eights) squared: 788,944 (1 zero)So, when n=1, zeros=0; n=2, zeros=0; n=3, zeros=1.Is there a pattern here? Maybe starting from n=3, the number of zeros is n-2. So, for n=3, zeros=1; n=4, zeros=2; and so on.If that's the case, then for n=8, zeros=6. So, 88,888,888 squared would have 6 zeros.But wait, I should verify this with n=4 to see if the pattern holds. Let me calculate 8888 squared.Calculating 8888 * 8888:First, 8000 * 8000 = 64,000,000Then, 8000 * 800 = 6,400,0008000 * 80 = 640,0008000 * 8 = 64,000Similarly, 800 * 8000 = 6,400,000800 * 800 = 640,000800 * 80 = 64,000800 * 8 = 6,400Then, 80 * 8000 = 640,00080 * 800 = 64,00080 * 80 = 6,40080 * 8 = 640Finally, 8 * 8000 = 64,0008 * 800 = 6,4008 * 80 = 6408 * 8 = 64Now, adding all these up. This seems tedious. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, I can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a = 8000 and b = 888.Wait, no, 8888 is 8000 + 800 + 80 + 8. Maybe that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity that (10^n - 1)/9 = 111...111 (n times). So, 11111111 = (10^8 - 1)/9.Therefore, 88888888 = 8 * 11111111 = 8 * (10^8 - 1)/9.So, squaring that, we get:(8 * (10^8 - 1)/9)^2 = 64 * (10^8 - 1)^2 / 81.Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe expanding (10^8 - 1)^2:(10^8 - 1)^2 = 10^16 - 2*10^8 + 1.So, 64 * (10^16 - 2*10^8 + 1)/81.This simplifies to (64*10^16 - 128*10^8 + 64)/81.Not sure if that helps me count the zeros. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, maybe I can look at the pattern of the squares:- 8^2 = 64- 88^2 = 7744- 888^2 = 788944- 8888^2 = ?If I can find a pattern in the digits, maybe I can figure out how many zeros are added each time.Looking at 888^2 = 788,944. It has one zero.If I square 8888, maybe it will have two zeros? Let me try to compute 8888^2.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 8888 is 8000 + 800 + 80 + 8, and use the expansion:(8000 + 800 + 80 + 8)^2.But that would involve a lot of terms. Maybe there's a smarter way.Alternatively, I can use the fact that 8888 = 8 * 1111.So, 8888^2 = (8 * 1111)^2 = 64 * (1111)^2.Calculating 1111^2: 1111 * 1111.I remember that 1111^2 = 1234321. Wait, no, that's 11111^2.Wait, 1111^2 is actually 1234321? No, let me compute it properly.1111 * 1111:First, 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,0001000 * 100 = 100,0001000 * 10 = 10,0001000 * 1 = 1,000100 * 1000 = 100,000100 * 100 = 10,000100 * 10 = 1,000100 * 1 = 10010 * 1000 = 10,00010 * 100 = 1,00010 * 10 = 10010 * 1 = 101 * 1000 = 1,0001 * 100 = 1001 * 10 = 101 * 1 = 1Adding all these up:1,000,000 + 100,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 100,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 100 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 100 + 10 + 1,000 + 100 + 10 + 1.Let me add them step by step:Start with 1,000,000.Add 100,000: 1,100,000Add 10,000: 1,110,000Add 1,000: 1,111,000Add 100,000: 1,211,000Add 10,000: 1,221,000Add 1,000: 1,222,000Add 100: 1,222,100Add 10,000: 1,232,100Add 1,000: 1,233,100Add 100: 1,233,200Add 10: 1,233,210Add 1,000: 1,234,210Add 100: 1,234,310Add 10: 1,234,320Add 1: 1,234,321.So, 1111^2 = 1,234,321.Therefore, 8888^2 = 64 * 1,234,321.Let me compute that:First, 1,234,321 * 60 = 74,059,260Then, 1,234,321 * 4 = 4,937,284Adding them together: 74,059,260 + 4,937,284 = 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284.Wait, let me add properly:74,059,260+ 4,937,284= 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284Wait, 74,059,260 + 4,937,284:74,059,260 + 4,000,000 = 78,059,26078,059,260 + 937,284 = 79, 059,260 + 937,284Wait, 78,059,260 + 937,284:78,059,260 + 900,000 = 78,959,26078,959,260 + 37,284 = 79, 059,260 + 37,284Wait, 78,959,260 + 37,284 = 79, 059,260 + 37,284Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I should just use a calculator for this step, but since I'm trying to solve this manually, let me try another approach.Alternatively, I can note that 74,059,260 + 4,937,284 = 74,059,260 + 4,937,284 = 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284.Wait, no, that's not helpful. Maybe I should just accept that I'm not able to add these two numbers correctly right now and move on.Assuming that 8888^2 has two zeros, following the pattern, then for n=4, zeros=2.

If 8888^2 has two zeros, then the pattern holds. But I'm not entirely sure because I couldn't compute 8888^2 correctly earlier.Alternatively, maybe I can look up the square of 8888 to confirm.Wait, I can recall that 8888^2 is 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284 = 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284 = 79, 059,260 + 4,937,284.Wait, no, that's not helpful. Maybe I should just accept that the pattern holds and that 88,888,888 squared has 6 zeros.So, based on the pattern, the number of zeros in the square of a number with n eights is n-2 for n >=3.Therefore, for 88,888,888 (which has 8 eights), the number of zeros in its square would be 8-2=6.So, the answer is 6 zeros."},{"question":"To complete the following three sampling surveys:① Randomly select 3 people from 10 class leaders in a class for a questionnaire survey.② The auditorium of the science and technology report has 60 rows, each with 50 seats.

The options are A, B, C, or D, each suggesting different sampling methods for each scenario. I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me recall the different sampling methods:1. **Simple Random Sampling (SRS):** Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. It's straightforward but can be time-consuming for large populations.2. **Stratified Sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, and then samples are taken from each stratum. This ensures representation from all subgroups.3. **Systematic Sampling:** A starting point is randomly selected, and then every nth individual is chosen from a list. It's easier to implement than SRS but might introduce bias if there's a periodic pattern in the population.Now, let's look at each scenario one by one.**Scenario ①:** Randomly select 3 people from 10 class leaders for a questionnaire survey.- Since there are only 10 class leaders, and we need a small sample of 3, the population is small and homogeneous. There's no mention of any subgroups or specific characteristics that need to be represented. So, the simplest method here would be **Simple Random Sampling**. Each leader has an equal chance of being selected, and it's easy to do with such a small number.**Scenario ②:** An auditorium with 60 rows, each with 50 seats. The audience fills all seats, and after the meeting, we need to randomly select 30 audience members for a discussion.- Here, the population is 60 x 50 = 3000 people. That's a large number, so SRS might be cumbersome. However, the auditorium is organized in rows and seats, which suggests a structured layout. Systematic sampling could work well here. For example, randomly pick a starting point in the first row and then select every nth person (where n is 3000/30 = 100). So, every 100th seat would be selected. This method is efficient and ensures a spread across the entire audience without bias, assuming there's no hidden pattern in the seating that could affect the results.**Scenario ③:** A high school with 160 staff members, including 120 teachers, 16 administrative staff, and 24 logistics personnel. We need to select a sample of 40 to understand their cultural level.- Here, the population is divided into distinct groups: teachers, administrative staff, and logistics personnel. These groups likely have different characteristics, especially regarding cultural level. To ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample, **Stratified Sampling** is appropriate. We can determine the proportion of each subgroup in the population and then select the same proportion in the sample. For example, teachers make up 75% (120/160), so 30 out of 40 in the sample would be teachers, and so on for the other groups.Now, let's match these conclusions to the options provided:- **Option A:** ① Simple random, ② Stratified, ③ Systematic- **Option B:** ① Simple random, ② Systematic, ③ Stratified- **Option C:** ① Systematic, ② Simple random, ③ Stratified- **Option D:** ① Stratified, ② Systematic, ③ Simple randomFrom my analysis:- ① should be Simple Random Sampling- ② should be Systematic Sampling- ③ should be Stratified SamplingSo, the correct option is **B**."},{"question":"The coordinates of A, B are (7,3) and (3,0) respectively.

The coordinates of ( A ) are ( (7, 3) ) and ( B ) are ( (3, 0) ). Point ( C ) is on the y-axis, so its coordinates are ( (0, k) ). First, I remember that the distance between two points ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) is given by the distance formula: ( sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} ). Since we're dealing with the square of the distances, I can just use the squared distance formula without the square root, which should make calculations easier.So, let's write down the squared distances ( AC^2 ) and ( BC^2 ).For ( AC^2 ):- The coordinates of ( A ) are ( (7, 3) ) and ( C ) is ( (0, k) ).- The squared distance ( AC^2 ) is ( (7 - 0)^2 + (3 - k)^2 ).- Simplifying that, it's ( 49 + (3 - k)^2 ).For ( BC^2 ):- The coordinates of ( B ) are ( (3, 0) ) and ( C ) is ( (0, k) ).- The squared distance ( BC^2 ) is ( (3 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2 ).- Simplifying that, it's ( 9 + k^2 ).Now, I need to find the sum ( AC^2 + BC^2 ) and then minimize it with respect to ( k ).So, let's add them together:[ AC^2 + BC^2 = 49 + (3 - k)^2 + 9 + k^2 ]Let me simplify this expression step by step.First, combine the constants:[ 49 + 9 = 58 ]Now, expand ( (3 - k)^2 ):[ (3 - k)^2 = 9 - 6k + k^2 ]So, substituting back into the equation:[ AC^2 + BC^2 = 58 + 9 - 6k + k^2 + k^2 ]Combine like terms:- The constant terms: ( 58 + 9 = 67 )- The ( k^2 ) terms: ( k^2 + k^2 = 2k^2 )- The linear term: ( -6k )So, the expression becomes:[ AC^2 + BC^2 = 67 + 2k^2 - 6k ]Now, I need to find the value of ( k ) that minimizes this quadratic expression. Since this is a quadratic in terms of ( k ), it will have a minimum value because the coefficient of ( k^2 ) is positive (which means the parabola opens upwards).To find the minimum, I can use calculus by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to ( k ) and setting it equal to zero. Alternatively, I can use the vertex formula for a parabola, which is ( k = -frac{b}{2a} ) for a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ).Let me try both methods to confirm.**Method 1: Using Calculus**Let ( S = 67 + 2k^2 - 6k ).Take the derivative of ( S ) with respect to ( k ):[ frac{dS}{dk} = 4k - 6 ]Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:[ 4k - 6 = 0 ][ 4k = 6 ][ k = frac{6}{4} ][ k = frac{3}{2} ]**Method 2: Using Vertex Formula**The quadratic expression is ( S = 2k^2 - 6k + 67 ).Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -6 ), and ( c = 67 ).The vertex occurs at:[ k = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{-6}{2 times 2} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2} ]Both methods give the same result: ( k = frac{3}{2} ).Therefore, the value of ( k ) that minimizes ( AC^2 + BC^2 ) is ( frac{3}{2} ).I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.Starting from the squared distances:- ( AC^2 = 49 + (3 - k)^2 )- ( BC^2 = 9 + k^2 )Adding them:[ 49 + 9 + (3 - k)^2 + k^2 = 58 + (9 - 6k + k^2) + k^2 = 58 + 9 - 6k + 2k^2 = 67 + 2k^2 - 6k ]Yes, that looks correct.Taking the derivative:[ frac{dS}{dk} = 4k - 6 ]Setting it to zero:[ 4k - 6 = 0 Rightarrow k = frac{3}{2} ]That seems right.Alternatively, using the vertex formula:[ k = -frac{b}{2a} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2} ]Everything checks out. So, I'm confident that ( k = frac{3}{2} ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{textbf{(A)} frac{3}{2}}"},{"question":"Let the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} be S_n. If 27a_3-a_6=0, then dfrac {S_{6}}{S_{3}}= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"Let the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric sequence ( {a_n} ) be ( S_n ). If ( 27a_3 - a_6 = 0 ), then ( dfrac{S_6}{S_3} = ) ______.\\"Alright, so I need to find the ratio of the sum of the first 6 terms to the sum of the first 3 terms of this geometric sequence. The condition given is ( 27a_3 - a_6 = 0 ). Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, denoted usually by ( r ). So, if the first term is ( a_1 ), then the second term is ( a_1 times r ), the third term is ( a_1 times r^2 ), and so on. So, in general, the ( n )-th term ( a_n ) is given by:( a_n = a_1 times r^{n-1} )Got that. So, ( a_3 = a_1 times r^{2} ) and ( a_6 = a_1 times r^{5} ). The problem gives me ( 27a_3 - a_6 = 0 ). Let me write that down:( 27a_3 - a_6 = 0 )Substituting the expressions for ( a_3 ) and ( a_6 ):( 27(a_1 r^2) - (a_1 r^5) = 0 )Let me factor out ( a_1 r^2 ):( a_1 r^2 (27 - r^3) = 0 )Now, since ( a_1 ) is the first term of the sequence, it can't be zero because otherwise, all terms would be zero, and the problem would be trivial. So, ( a_1 neq 0 ). Similarly, ( r ) can't be zero because that would also make the sequence trivial after the first term. So, ( r neq 0 ). Therefore, the term ( a_1 r^2 ) is not zero, which means the other factor must be zero:( 27 - r^3 = 0 )Solving for ( r ):( r^3 = 27 )Taking the cube root of both sides:( r = sqrt[3]{27} )( r = 3 )Okay, so the common ratio ( r ) is 3. That makes sense.Now, I need to find ( dfrac{S_6}{S_3} ). Let's recall the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric sequence. The sum ( S_n ) is given by:( S_n = a_1 times dfrac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} ) when ( r neq 1 )Since ( r = 3 ), which is not equal to 1, we can use this formula.So, let's compute ( S_6 ) and ( S_3 ) separately.First, ( S_6 ):( S_6 = a_1 times dfrac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3} )Calculating ( 3^6 ):( 3^1 = 3 )( 3^2 = 9 )( 3^3 = 27 )( 3^4 = 81 )( 3^5 = 243 )( 3^6 = 729 )So, ( S_6 = a_1 times dfrac{1 - 729}{1 - 3} )Simplify the numerator and denominator:Numerator: ( 1 - 729 = -728 )Denominator: ( 1 - 3 = -2 )So, ( S_6 = a_1 times dfrac{-728}{-2} )Dividing two negatives gives a positive:( S_6 = a_1 times 364 )So, ( S_6 = 364 a_1 )Now, let's compute ( S_3 ):( S_3 = a_1 times dfrac{1 - 3^3}{1 - 3} )Calculating ( 3^3 ):( 3^3 = 27 )So, ( S_3 = a_1 times dfrac{1 - 27}{1 - 3} )Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: ( 1 - 27 = -26 )Denominator: ( 1 - 3 = -2 )So, ( S_3 = a_1 times dfrac{-26}{-2} )Again, dividing two negatives gives a positive:( S_3 = a_1 times 13 )So, ( S_3 = 13 a_1 )Now, I need to find the ratio ( dfrac{S_6}{S_3} ):( dfrac{S_6}{S_3} = dfrac{364 a_1}{13 a_1} )I notice that ( a_1 ) is in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:( dfrac{364}{13} )Now, let's compute this division:( 364 ÷ 13 )Let me do this step by step.First, 13 times 20 is 260.Subtract 260 from 364: 364 - 260 = 104Now, 13 times 8 is 104.So, 20 + 8 = 28Therefore, ( 364 ÷ 13 = 28 )So, ( dfrac{S_6}{S_3} = 28 )Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, ( 3^6 = 729 ), correct.So, ( S_6 = a_1 times (1 - 729)/(1 - 3) = a_1 times (-728)/(-2) = 364 a_1 ), that's correct.Then, ( S_3 = a_1 times (1 - 27)/(1 - 3) = a_1 times (-26)/(-2) = 13 a_1 ), correct.So, ( 364 / 13 = 28 ), yes, because 13 times 28 is 364.Yes, that seems right.Therefore, the ratio ( S_6 / S_3 ) is 28.I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure.1. Recognize it's a geometric sequence, so each term is multiplied by the common ratio ( r ).2. Given ( 27a_3 - a_6 = 0 ), substitute ( a_3 = a_1 r^2 ) and ( a_6 = a_1 r^5 ).3. Factor out ( a_1 r^2 ) to get ( 27 - r^3 = 0 ), so ( r = 3 ).4. Use the sum formula for geometric series ( S_n = a_1 (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) ).5. Compute ( S_6 ) and ( S_3 ) with ( r = 3 ).6. Simplify the ratio ( S_6 / S_3 ) by canceling ( a_1 ) and performing the division.7. The result is 28.Everything seems to check out.

David noticed that if the dividend is increased by two and the divisor by seven, the quotient remains unchanged.By how much should the divisor be increased so that when the dividend is increased by three, the quotient again remains unchanged?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about dividing two positive numbers. David noticed that if the dividend is increased by two and the divisor by seven, the quotient remains unchanged. Now, the question is asking by how much should the divisor be increased so that when the dividend is increased by three, the quotient again remains unchanged.Alright, let's break this down. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have two numbers, a dividend (which is the number being divided) and a divisor (which is the number we're dividing by). When David increases the dividend by 2 and the divisor by 7, the result of the division, which is the quotient, stays the same. So, the ratio of the new dividend to the new divisor is equal to the original ratio.Let me denote the original dividend as 'n' and the original divisor as 't'. So, the original quotient is n divided by t, which is n/t. According to the problem, when we add 2 to the dividend and 7 to the divisor, the new quotient is (n+2)/(t+7), and this is equal to the original quotient n/t. So, I can write that as an equation:n/t = (n + 2)/(t + 7)Okay, so now I have this equation, and I need to solve for either n or t, or maybe find a relationship between them. Let's see. To solve this equation, I can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. So, multiplying both sides by t and (t + 7) gives:n(t + 7) = t(n + 2)Let me expand both sides:n*t + 7n = t*n + 2tHmm, interesting. So, on the left side, I have n*t plus 7n, and on the right side, I have t*n plus 2t. Wait a minute, n*t and t*n are the same thing, right? So, they cancel each other out when I subtract n*t from both sides. Let's do that:n*t + 7n - n*t = t*n + 2t - n*tSimplifying both sides:7n = 2tSo, 7n equals 2t. That gives me a relationship between n and t. I can write this as:7n = 2tOr, solving for n/t, which is the original quotient:n/t = 2/7So, the original quotient is 2/7. That means n is two-sevenths of t. Okay, that's useful information.Now, moving on to the main question. It asks by how much the divisor should be increased so that when the dividend is increased by three, the quotient remains unchanged. Let's denote the amount by which the divisor should be increased as 'z'. So, the new dividend will be n + 3, and the new divisor will be t + z. The quotient should still be the same as the original quotient, which we found to be 2/7.So, setting up the equation:(n + 3)/(t + z) = 2/7But we already know from earlier that n/t = 2/7, so n = (2/7)t. Maybe I can substitute that into the equation to solve for z. Let's try that.Substituting n = (2/7)t into the equation:((2/7)t + 3)/(t + z) = 2/7Okay, let's simplify the numerator:(2/7)t + 3 can be written as (2t/7 + 3). To combine these terms, I can write 3 as 21/7 so that both terms have the same denominator:2t/7 + 21/7 = (2t + 21)/7So, the numerator becomes (2t + 21)/7. Now, the equation is:(2t + 21)/7 divided by (t + z) equals 2/7.So, writing that out:[(2t + 21)/7] / (t + z) = 2/7Dividing by (t + z) is the same as multiplying by 1/(t + z), so:(2t + 21)/7 * 1/(t + z) = 2/7Simplify the left side:(2t + 21)/(7(t + z)) = 2/7Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for z. Multiply both sides by 7(t + z):2t + 21 = 2(t + z)Let's expand the right side:2t + 21 = 2t + 2zHmm, now subtract 2t from both sides:21 = 2zSo, solving for z:z = 21/2Which is 10.5.Wait, so z is 10.5? That means the divisor should be increased by 10.5 to keep the quotient the same when the dividend is increased by 3. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the equation:(n + 3)/(t + z) = 2/7We know n = (2/7)t, so substituting:((2/7)t + 3)/(t + z) = 2/7Convert 3 to 21/7:(2t/7 + 21/7)/(t + z) = 2/7Combine the numerator:(2t + 21)/7 divided by (t + z) = 2/7Which simplifies to:(2t + 21)/(7(t + z)) = 2/7Cross-multiplying:2t + 21 = 2(t + z)Expanding:2t + 21 = 2t + 2zSubtract 2t:21 = 2zSo, z = 10.5Yes, that seems correct. So, the divisor needs to be increased by 10.5 to maintain the same quotient when the dividend is increased by 3.I think that makes sense. The relationship between the increases in dividend and divisor depends on the original quotient. Since the original quotient was 2/7, increasing the dividend by 3 (which is 3 times the numerator of the quotient) requires increasing the divisor by 3 times the denominator, which is 3*7/2 = 10.5. That seems logical.So, I believe the answer is 10.5."},{"question":"Let  a_{i,j}enspace(forallenspace 1leq ileq n, 1leq jleq n)  be  n^2  real numbers such that  a_{i,j}+a_{j,i}=0enspaceforall i, j  (in particular,  a_{i,i}=0enspaceforall i ).

","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove an inequality involving a skew-symmetric matrix. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to show.First, the problem states that we have real numbers ( a_{i,j} ) for all ( 1 leq i, j leq n ). These numbers satisfy the condition ( a_{i,j} + a_{j,i} = 0 ) for all ( i, j ). This means that the matrix ( A = (a_{i,j}) ) is skew-symmetric. Also, since ( a_{i,i} = 0 ) for all ( i ), the diagonal elements of this matrix are zero.The inequality I need to prove is:[frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} left( sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} right)^2 leq frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j}^2.]Hmm, so on the left side, we have an average of the squares of the row sums of the matrix ( A ), and on the right side, we have half of the sum of the squares of all the entries of ( A ).I remember that for matrices, especially skew-symmetric ones, there are some properties related to eigenvalues and norms that might be useful here. Skew-symmetric matrices have purely imaginary eigenvalues, and their Frobenius norm relates to the sum of squares of their entries.Let me try to rewrite the left side of the inequality in a different form. The term ( sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} ) is the sum of the elements in the ( i )-th row of ( A ). If I denote the vector of all ones as ( mathbf{e} = (1, 1, ldots, 1)^T ), then ( sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} ) is the ( i )-th component of the vector ( A mathbf{e} ).So, the left side can be written as:[frac{1}{n} | A mathbf{e} |^2,]where ( | cdot | ) denotes the Euclidean norm.The right side is:[frac{1}{2} | A |_F^2,]where ( | A |_F ) is the Frobenius norm of ( A ), which is the square root of the sum of the squares of all its entries.So, the inequality becomes:[frac{1}{n} | A mathbf{e} |^2 leq frac{1}{2} | A |_F^2.]I need to show that this holds for any skew-symmetric matrix ( A ).I recall that for any matrix ( A ), the following inequality holds:[| A mathbf{e} |^2 leq | A |^2 | mathbf{e} |^2,]where ( | A | ) is the spectral norm (the largest singular value of ( A )) and ( | mathbf{e} |^2 = n ) since ( mathbf{e} ) is a vector of ones.Applying this, we get:[| A mathbf{e} |^2 leq n | A |^2.]Therefore, the left side of our inequality becomes:[frac{1}{n} | A mathbf{e} |^2 leq frac{1}{n} cdot n | A |^2 = | A |^2.]So, it suffices to show that:[| A |^2 leq frac{1}{2} | A |_F^2.]This seems like a key step. I need to relate the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm of a skew-symmetric matrix.I remember that for any matrix, the spectral norm is less than or equal to the Frobenius norm. But here, we have a specific inequality involving a factor of ( frac{1}{2} ). Maybe this has to do with the properties of skew-symmetric matrices.Skew-symmetric matrices have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary or zero. Moreover, their non-zero eigenvalues come in pairs of the form ( pm lambda i ), where ( lambda ) is real. This means that the eigenvalues are symmetrically distributed around the origin in the complex plane.The Frobenius norm of ( A ) is the square root of the sum of the squares of its singular values. For a skew-symmetric matrix, the singular values are the absolute values of the eigenvalues, which are real and non-negative.Let me denote the eigenvalues of ( A ) as ( lambda_1, lambda_2, ldots, lambda_n ). Since ( A ) is skew-symmetric, each ( lambda_k ) is either zero or purely imaginary. Let's write them as ( lambda_k = i mu_k ), where ( mu_k ) is real. Then, the singular values of ( A ) are ( |lambda_k| = |mu_k| ).The Frobenius norm squared is:[| A |_F^2 = sum_{k=1}^{n} |lambda_k|^2 = sum_{k=1}^{n} mu_k^2.]The spectral norm ( | A | ) is the largest singular value, which is the maximum ( |mu_k| ). Let's denote ( mu_{text{max}} = max_{k} |mu_k| ).So, the inequality we need to show becomes:[mu_{text{max}}^2 leq frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n} mu_k^2.]This is equivalent to:[2 mu_{text{max}}^2 leq sum_{k=1}^{n} mu_k^2.]Hmm, this seems like an inequality that might relate to the fact that the eigenvalues come in pairs. Since non-zero eigenvalues come in pairs ( pm mu i ), their squares ( mu^2 ) would add up twice for each pair.Let me think about this. Suppose that ( A ) has eigenvalues ( pm mu_1 i, pm mu_2 i, ldots, pm mu_m i ), and the rest are zero. Then, the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues would be ( 2(mu_1^2 + mu_2^2 + ldots + mu_m^2) ).In this case, the spectral norm squared is ( mu_{text{max}}^2 ), where ( mu_{text{max}} ) is the largest among ( mu_1, mu_2, ldots, mu_m ). Then, the inequality becomes:[2 mu_{text{max}}^2 leq 2(mu_1^2 + mu_2^2 + ldots + mu_m^2),]which simplifies to:[mu_{text{max}}^2 leq mu_1^2 + mu_2^2 + ldots + mu_m^2.]This is obviously true because ( mu_{text{max}}^2 ) is just one term in the sum on the right-hand side. Therefore, the inequality holds.Wait, but in the case where all eigenvalues except one are zero, does this still hold? Suppose ( A ) has only one non-zero eigenvalue ( mu i ). Then, the sum of squares would be ( 2 mu^2 ), and the spectral norm squared is ( mu^2 ). Then, the inequality becomes:[2 mu^2 leq 2 mu^2,]which is an equality. So, it still holds.Therefore, in general, for any skew-symmetric matrix, the inequality ( | A |^2 leq frac{1}{2} | A |_F^2 ) holds. This implies that:[frac{1}{n} | A mathbf{e} |^2 leq | A |^2 leq frac{1}{2} | A |_F^2,]which is exactly the inequality we needed to prove.So, putting it all together, we've used the properties of skew-symmetric matrices, their eigenvalues, and the relationship between the spectral and Frobenius norms to establish the desired inequality.**Final Answer**boxed{frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}left(sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j}right)^2leq{1over2}sum_{i=1}^{n}sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j}^2}"},{"question":"Thirty percent less than 80 is one-fourth more than what number?mathrm{(A)} 44qquad mathrm{(B)} 45qquad mathrm{(C)} 46qquad mathrm{(D)} 47qquad mathrm{(E)} 48","answer":"First, calculate thirty percent less than 80:[80 - 0.30 times 80 = 80 - 24 = 56]Next, set up the equation where 56 is one-fourth more than a number ( n ):[frac{5}{4}n = 56]Solve for ( n ):[n = 56 times frac{4}{5} = 44.8]Since the answer choices are whole numbers, round 44.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 45."},{"question":"Given the one-variable quadratic equation in x: x^{2}-(m-3)x-m=0.

(2) If the two real roots of the equation are x_{1} and x_{2}, and x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}-x_{1}x_{2}=13, find the value of m.","answer":"Alright, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 - (m - 3)x - m = 0 ). The problem has two parts. First, I need to prove that this equation has two distinct real roots. Second, given that the roots are ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), and that ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 = 13 ), I need to find the value of ( m ).Starting with part (1). I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the discriminant ( Delta = b^2 - 4ac ) determines the nature of the roots. If ( Delta > 0 ), there are two distinct real roots. So, I need to calculate the discriminant for this equation.Given the equation ( x^2 - (m - 3)x - m = 0 ), the coefficients are:- ( a = 1 )- ( b = -(m - 3) )- ( c = -m )So, plugging into the discriminant formula:( Delta = [-(m - 3)]^2 - 4(1)(-m) )Simplifying that:( Delta = (m - 3)^2 + 4m )Expanding ( (m - 3)^2 ):( m^2 - 6m + 9 + 4m )Combine like terms:( m^2 - 2m + 9 )Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of ( m ). To see if it's always positive, maybe I can complete the square or see if it's a perfect square plus something.Completing the square:( m^2 - 2m + 1 + 8 = (m - 1)^2 + 8 )Since ( (m - 1)^2 ) is always non-negative, adding 8 ensures that ( Delta ) is always greater than 8, which is positive. Therefore, the discriminant is always positive, meaning the equation always has two distinct real roots, regardless of the value of ( m ). So, part (1) is proven.Moving on to part (2). I need to find ( m ) given that ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 = 13 ). I remember that for quadratic equations, the sum and product of roots can be expressed using Vieta's formulas. Specifically:- ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{-b}{a} )- ( x_1x_2 = frac{c}{a} )From the given equation:- ( x_1 + x_2 = m - 3 )- ( x_1x_2 = -m )I need to express ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 ) in terms of these sums and products. Let's see:First, ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 ) can be written as ( (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 ). So:( x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 )Therefore, ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 - x_1x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 3x_1x_2 )Plugging in the values from Vieta's formulas:( (m - 3)^2 - 3(-m) = 13 )Simplify this equation:First, expand ( (m - 3)^2 ):( m^2 - 6m + 9 )Then, subtract ( 3(-m) ), which is adding ( 3m ):( m^2 - 6m + 9 + 3m = m^2 - 3m + 9 )Set this equal to 13:( m^2 - 3m + 9 = 13 )Subtract 13 from both sides:( m^2 - 3m - 4 = 0 )Now, solve this quadratic equation for ( m ). Let's factor it:Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. Those numbers are -4 and +1.So, ( (m - 4)(m + 1) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero:- ( m - 4 = 0 ) => ( m = 4 )- ( m + 1 = 0 ) => ( m = -1 )So, the possible values for ( m ) are 4 and -1.Wait, but I should check if these values satisfy the original condition ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 = 13 ). Let me verify.First, for ( m = 4 ):The equation becomes ( x^2 - (4 - 3)x - 4 = x^2 - x - 4 = 0 )Sum of roots: ( x_1 + x_2 = 1 )Product of roots: ( x_1x_2 = -4 )Compute ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 ):( (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 3x_1x_2 = 1^2 - 3(-4) = 1 + 12 = 13 )Yes, that works.Now, for ( m = -1 ):The equation becomes ( x^2 - (-1 - 3)x - (-1) = x^2 - (-4)x + 1 = x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 )Sum of roots: ( x_1 + x_2 = -4 )Product of roots: ( x_1x_2 = 1 )Compute ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2 ):( (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 3x_1x_2 = (-4)^2 - 3(1) = 16 - 3 = 13 )That also works.So both values of ( m ) satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the solutions are ( m = 4 ) and ( m = -1 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{4} or boxed{-1}."},{"question":"A school does a yearly tree planting activity.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:Given a sequence ({a_n}) with the first term (a_1 = 2), and (S_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}) for (n in mathbb{Z}^{+}), find the general formula for the sequence ({a_n}), which is (a_n = ) ______.Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand what (S_{n+1}) represents here. Usually, (S_n) denotes the sum of the first (n) terms of a sequence. So, (S_{n+1}) would be the sum of the first (n+1) terms. That is, (S_{n+1} = a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_{n+1}).But the problem gives me a formula for (S_{n+1}) in terms of (a_{n+1}). It says (S_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}). So, for each positive integer (n), the sum of the first (n+1) terms is equal to two-thirds of the ((n+1))-th term plus one-third.I need to find a general formula for (a_n). Let's see. Maybe I can express (S_{n+1}) in terms of (S_n) and then relate (a_{n+1}) to (a_n).Since (S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}), right? Because the sum up to (n+1) is the sum up to (n) plus the next term. So, substituting that into the given equation:(S_n + a_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Let me write that down:(S_n + a_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Now, I can solve for (S_n):(S_n = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3} - a_{n+1}).Simplify the right-hand side:First, combine the terms with (a_{n+1}):(dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} - a_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} - dfrac{3}{3}a_{n+1} = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1}).So, (S_n = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Hmm, okay. So, we have an expression for (S_n) in terms of (a_{n+1}). But we also know that (S_n) is the sum of the first (n) terms, which can be expressed as (S_n = a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n).But maybe I can also express (S_n) in terms of (a_n). Let me think. If I shift the index by 1, then for (n) replaced by (n-1), we have:(S_{n} = dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3}).Wait, is that correct? Let me check.The original equation is (S_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}). So, if I replace (n) with (n-1), then (S_{(n-1)+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{(n-1)+1} + dfrac{1}{3}), which simplifies to (S_n = dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3}).Yes, that's correct. So, (S_n = dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3}).But earlier, I had another expression for (S_n): (S_n = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).So, setting these two expressions equal to each other:(dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Let me write that equation:(dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Now, subtract (dfrac{1}{3}) from both sides:(dfrac{2}{3}a_n = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1}).Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:(2a_n = -a_{n+1}).So, rearranged:(a_{n+1} = -2a_n).Ah, so this is a recursive relation. Each term is -2 times the previous term. So, the sequence is a geometric sequence with common ratio (r = -2).But wait, the first term is (a_1 = 2). So, if it's a geometric sequence starting from (a_1), then (a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1}).But hold on, let me check if this holds for all (n). Because sometimes, the recursive relation might start from a different term.Wait, the recursive relation we found is (a_{n+1} = -2a_n). So, starting from (a_1), (a_2 = -2a_1 = -4), (a_3 = -2a_2 = 8), and so on. But let me check if this is consistent with the given condition.Wait, let's compute (S_{n+1}) using the given formula and see if it aligns with the sum.Given (a_1 = 2), (a_2 = -4), (a_3 = 8), etc.Compute (S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 2 + (-4) = -2).According to the given formula, (S_{2} = dfrac{2}{3}a_2 + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{2}{3}(-4) + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{8}{3} + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{7}{3}).But wait, (S_2) is actually -2, which is (-dfrac{6}{3}), not (-dfrac{7}{3}). There's a discrepancy here.Hmm, that suggests that my assumption that the recursive relation (a_{n+1} = -2a_n) holds for all (n) starting from (n=1) might be incorrect.Wait, let's go back. I had:From (S_n = dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3}) and (S_n = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}), so setting them equal:(dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).Subtracting (dfrac{1}{3}) from both sides:(dfrac{2}{3}a_n = -dfrac{1}{3}a_{n+1}).Multiply both sides by 3:(2a_n = -a_{n+1}), so (a_{n+1} = -2a_n).This should hold for all (n geq 1), right? Because the original equation was given for (n in mathbb{Z}^{+}), which is positive integers, so (n geq 1).But when I tried computing (S_2), it didn't match. So, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that (S_n = dfrac{2}{3}a_n + dfrac{1}{3}) for all (n). Let me check that.The original equation is (S_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}). So, for (n=1), (S_2 = dfrac{2}{3}a_2 + dfrac{1}{3}). But (S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 2 + a_2).So, substituting (n=1) into the original equation:(S_2 = dfrac{2}{3}a_2 + dfrac{1}{3}).But (S_2 = 2 + a_2). Therefore:(2 + a_2 = dfrac{2}{3}a_2 + dfrac{1}{3}).Let me solve for (a_2):Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:(6 + 3a_2 = 2a_2 + 1).Subtract (2a_2) from both sides:(6 + a_2 = 1).Subtract 6:(a_2 = 1 - 6 = -5).Ah! So, (a_2 = -5), not -4 as I previously thought. So, my initial assumption that (a_{n+1} = -2a_n) starting from (a_1) is incorrect because (a_2) is not -4 but -5.So, let's correct that. The recursive relation (a_{n+1} = -2a_n) holds for (n geq 1), but (a_2 = -5), not -4.So, starting from (a_1 = 2), (a_2 = -5), then (a_3 = -2a_2 = -2(-5) = 10), (a_4 = -2a_3 = -20), and so on.Wait, let's verify this with (S_3).Compute (S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2 + (-5) + 10 = 7).According to the given formula, (S_3 = dfrac{2}{3}a_3 + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{2}{3}(10) + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{20}{3} + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{21}{3} = 7). That matches.Similarly, (S_2 = 2 + (-5) = -3). According to the formula, (S_2 = dfrac{2}{3}a_2 + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{2}{3}(-5) + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{10}{3} + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{9}{3} = -3). That also matches.So, my mistake earlier was assuming that (a_2 = -4), but actually, (a_2 = -5). Therefore, the recursive relation (a_{n+1} = -2a_n) holds for (n geq 1), but the initial term is (a_1 = 2), and (a_2 = -5).Therefore, the sequence is a geometric sequence starting from (a_2) with common ratio (r = -2). So, for (n geq 2), (a_n = a_2 cdot r^{n - 2}).Given (a_2 = -5) and (r = -2), then:(a_n = -5 cdot (-2)^{n - 2}) for (n geq 2).But we also have (a_1 = 2). So, the general formula for (a_n) is:[a_n = begin{cases}2, & text{if } n = 1, -5 cdot (-2)^{n - 2}, & text{if } n geq 2.end{cases}]Let me verify this for a few terms.For (n=1), (a_1 = 2). Correct.For (n=2), (a_2 = -5 cdot (-2)^{0} = -5 cdot 1 = -5). Correct.For (n=3), (a_3 = -5 cdot (-2)^{1} = -5 cdot (-2) = 10). Correct.For (n=4), (a_4 = -5 cdot (-2)^{2} = -5 cdot 4 = -20). Correct.And (S_4 = 2 + (-5) + 10 + (-20) = -13). According to the formula, (S_4 = dfrac{2}{3}a_4 + dfrac{1}{3} = dfrac{2}{3}(-20) + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{40}{3} + dfrac{1}{3} = -dfrac{39}{3} = -13). Correct.So, the formula seems to hold.Therefore, the general formula for the sequence is:[a_n = begin{cases}2, & text{if } n = 1, -5 cdot (-2)^{n - 2}, & text{if } n geq 2.end{cases}]I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.Wait, another way to write this without the piecewise function is to express it as:(a_n = 2) when (n=1), and for (n geq 2), it's (-5 cdot (-2)^{n - 2}). Alternatively, we can write it using the Heaviside step function or something, but I think the piecewise definition is clearer.Alternatively, we can express it as:(a_n = 2 cdot delta_{n,1} + (-5) cdot (-2)^{n - 2} cdot theta(n - 2)),where (delta_{n,1}) is the Kronecker delta (1 when (n=1), 0 otherwise) and (theta(n - 2)) is the Heaviside step function (1 when (n geq 2), 0 otherwise). But that might be more complicated than necessary.So, the simplest way is to present it as a piecewise function.Just to recap:1. Given (a_1 = 2).2. Given (S_{n+1} = dfrac{2}{3}a_{n+1} + dfrac{1}{3}).3. Expressed (S_{n+1}) as (S_n + a_{n+1}).4. Derived that (a_{n+1} = -2a_n) for (n geq 1).5. Found (a_2 = -5) by plugging (n=1) into the original equation.6. Noted that the sequence is geometric with ratio (-2) starting from (a_2).7. Verified the formula with several terms and sums to ensure consistency.Therefore, I'm confident that the general formula is correct as stated."},{"question":"Given the set A={x|frac{x-a}{x-3a}＜0}(a≠0), the solution set of the inequality x^{2}-5x+6 lt 0 is denoted as B.<br/>(1) When a=1, find Acup B;<br/>(2) If xin A is a necessary but not sufficient condition for xin B, find the range of real number a.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about sets A and B, and I need to figure out two things. First, when a equals 1, I need to find the union of sets A and B. Second, I need to determine the range of real numbers a such that being in set A is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being in set B. Hmm, okay, let's start with part (1).**Part (1): When a = 1**Alright, so set A is defined as {x | (x - a)/(x - 3a) < 0} where a ≠ 0. When a = 1, this becomes {x | (x - 1)/(x - 3) < 0}. I need to solve this inequality to find set A.To solve (x - 1)/(x - 3) < 0, I remember that a fraction is less than zero when the numerator and denominator have opposite signs. So, I need to find the intervals where (x - 1) and (x - 3) have opposite signs.First, let's find the critical points where each factor is zero: x = 1 and x = 3. These points divide the real number line into three intervals:1. x < 12. 1 < x < 33. x > 3Now, I'll test each interval:1. For x < 1, say x = 0: (0 - 1)/(0 - 3) = (-1)/(-3) = 1/3 > 0. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.2. For 1 < x < 3, say x = 2: (2 - 1)/(2 - 3) = 1/(-1) = -1 < 0. This interval satisfies the inequality.3. For x > 3, say x = 4: (4 - 1)/(4 - 3) = 3/1 = 3 > 0. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.Therefore, set A when a = 1 is the interval (1, 3).Now, set B is the solution set of the inequality x² - 5x + 6 < 0. Let's solve this quadratic inequality.First, factor the quadratic: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3). So, the inequality becomes (x - 2)(x - 3) < 0.Again, we'll find the critical points: x = 2 and x = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals:1. x < 22. 2 < x < 33. x > 3Testing each interval:1. For x < 2, say x = 1: (1 - 2)(1 - 3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0. Doesn't satisfy the inequality.2. For 2 < x < 3, say x = 2.5: (2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0. Satisfies the inequality.3. For x > 3, say x = 4: (4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0. Doesn't satisfy the inequality.So, set B is the interval (2, 3).Now, to find A ∪ B, we take the union of intervals (1, 3) and (2, 3). Since (2, 3) is entirely contained within (1, 3), the union is just (1, 3).Wait, that seems straightforward. So, for part (1), A ∪ B is (1, 3).**Part (2): Necessary but Not Sufficient Condition**Okay, now this part is a bit trickier. The problem states that x ∈ A is a necessary but not sufficient condition for x ∈ B. Let me unpack that.In logic, if P is a necessary condition for Q, it means that Q can only be true if P is true. In other words, Q implies P (Q → P). But it's not sufficient, meaning P doesn't necessarily imply Q. So, P is necessary for Q, but P alone isn't enough to guarantee Q.Applying this to our sets: If x ∈ A is a necessary condition for x ∈ B, then every element of B must be in A. In other words, B is a subset of A. However, since it's not sufficient, there are elements in A that are not in B. So, B is a proper subset of A.Therefore, we need to find the range of a such that B ⊂ A, but A is not equal to B.First, let's recall what sets A and B are.Set A is {x | (x - a)/(x - 3a) < 0}, which we can rewrite as (x - a)(x - 3a) < 0, considering the inequality.Set B is (2, 3), as we found earlier.So, we need (2, 3) ⊂ A, but A must be larger than (2, 3). Let's analyze set A.The inequality (x - a)(x - 3a) < 0 will have different intervals depending on the value of a. Let's consider two cases: a > 0 and a < 0.**Case 1: a > 0**If a is positive, then 3a > a. So, the critical points are a and 3a, with a < 3a. The inequality (x - a)(x - 3a) < 0 will be satisfied when x is between a and 3a. So, set A is (a, 3a).We need (2, 3) ⊂ (a, 3a). For this to happen, the interval (2, 3) must be entirely contained within (a, 3a). Therefore, we must have:a ≤ 2 and 3a ≥ 3.Let's solve these inequalities:1. a ≤ 22. 3a ≥ 3 ⇒ a ≥ 1So, combining these, we get 1 ≤ a ≤ 2.But we also need A to be larger than B, meaning that (a, 3a) must not be equal to (2, 3). So, either a < 2 or 3a > 3.But since a ≥ 1 and a ≤ 2, let's see:If a = 1, then A = (1, 3). Since B = (2, 3), A is larger than B, so that's fine.If a = 2, then A = (2, 6). Wait, hold on, 3a would be 6, not 3. So, A = (2, 6). But B is (2, 3). So, B is still a proper subset of A because A goes up to 6.Wait, but earlier I thought that 3a should be ≥ 3, which would be a ≥ 1. But if a = 2, 3a = 6, which is greater than 3, so that's okay.But wait, if a = 1, A is (1, 3), which includes B = (2, 3). If a = 2, A is (2, 6), which also includes B = (2, 3). So, both a = 1 and a = 2 satisfy the condition that B is a proper subset of A.But what about a between 1 and 2? Let's take a = 1.5. Then, A = (1.5, 4.5). B = (2, 3) is still a subset of A. So, that's fine.So, for a > 0, the range is 1 ≤ a ≤ 2.**Case 2: a < 0**Now, if a is negative, then 3a < a because multiplying a negative number by 3 makes it more negative. So, the critical points are 3a and a, with 3a < a.The inequality (x - a)(x - 3a) < 0 will be satisfied when x is between 3a and a. So, set A is (3a, a).But set B is (2, 3). For B to be a subset of A, we need (2, 3) ⊂ (3a, a). However, since a is negative, 3a is more negative than a, so (3a, a) is an interval from a negative number to a less negative number, which is entirely to the left of zero on the number line.But set B is (2, 3), which is entirely to the right of zero. Therefore, there is no overlap between A and B when a < 0. Hence, B cannot be a subset of A in this case.Therefore, a cannot be negative.**Conclusion for Part (2)**From the above analysis, the only valid range for a is when a is positive and between 1 and 2, inclusive. So, the range of a is [1, 2].**Final Answer**(1) boxed{(1, 3)}(2) boxed{[1, 2]}"},{"question":"Select two odd numbers and two even numbers from the six numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to form a four-digit number without repeating digits. How many such numbers can be formed? (Answer in digits)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to select two odd numbers and two even numbers from the six numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to form a four-digit number without repeating any digits. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me identify which numbers are odd and which are even in the given set. The numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, the odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and the even numbers are 0, 2, 4. That means there are 3 odd numbers and 3 even numbers.The problem asks for a four-digit number, which means the first digit can't be 0 because that would make it a three-digit number. So, I need to be careful about where I place the 0 if I include it in my selection.I need to select two odd numbers and two even numbers. Let's break this down:1. **Selecting the Odd Numbers:**   There are 3 odd numbers: 1, 3, 5. I need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).   So, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3 ways.2. **Selecting the Even Numbers:**   There are 3 even numbers: 0, 2, 4. I need to choose 2 of them. Again, using the combination formula:   C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3 ways.   However, I need to consider two cases here because 0 is one of the even numbers, and it can't be in the first position of the four-digit number.   **Case 1: The two even numbers do not include 0.**   If I exclude 0, I'm left with 2 even numbers: 2 and 4. So, I need to choose both of them. There's only 1 way to do this since there are exactly 2 even numbers left.   **Case 2: The two even numbers include 0.**   If I include 0, then I need to choose 1 more even number from the remaining two: 2 and 4. So, the number of ways is C(2, 1) = 2.3. **Calculating the Total Combinations:**   Now, let's calculate the total number of ways to select the numbers:   - For Case 1: 3 (ways to choose odd numbers) * 1 (ways to choose even numbers) = 3 combinations.   - For Case 2: 3 (ways to choose odd numbers) * 2 (ways to choose even numbers) = 6 combinations.   So, in total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 combinations of numbers.4. **Arranging the Selected Numbers:**   Now, for each combination, I need to arrange the four numbers into a four-digit number without repeating any digits. However, I need to remember that 0 cannot be in the first position.   Let's handle each case separately.   **Case 1: Even numbers do not include 0.**   In this case, all four numbers are non-zero, so there are no restrictions on the first digit. The number of ways to arrange 4 distinct digits is 4! = 24.   So, for Case 1: 3 combinations * 24 arrangements = 72 four-digit numbers.   **Case 2: Even numbers include 0.**   Here, one of the even numbers is 0, which cannot be in the first position. So, we need to calculate the number of valid arrangements.   First, choose the first digit. Since 0 can't be first, we have 3 choices (the other three numbers). Then, arrange the remaining 3 numbers (including 0) in the remaining 3 positions. The number of ways to do this is 3 * 3! = 3 * 6 = 18.   So, for Case 2: 6 combinations * 18 arrangements = 108 four-digit numbers.5. **Adding Both Cases Together:**   Finally, add the numbers from both cases to get the total number of four-digit numbers:   72 (from Case 1) + 108 (from Case 2) = 180.   So, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is 180.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.- For selecting the odd numbers: C(3,2) = 3. That seems correct.- For selecting the even numbers:  - Case 1: C(2,2) = 1.  - Case 2: C(2,1) = 2.  - Total: 3 combinations for even numbers. Wait, no, actually, the total combinations for even numbers depend on whether we include 0 or not. So, in Case 1, it's 1 way, and in Case 2, it's 2 ways, making a total of 3 ways for even numbers. Then, multiplied by the 3 ways for odd numbers, giving 9 combinations. That seems right.- Arrangements:  - Case 1: 4! = 24. 3 * 24 = 72. Correct.  - Case 2: First digit has 3 choices, then 3! for the rest. So, 3 * 6 = 18. 6 combinations * 18 = 108. Correct.- Total: 72 + 108 = 180. Yep, that adds up.I think my reasoning is solid here. I considered the restrictions on 0 and handled the two cases separately, which is important because 0 can't be in the first position. By breaking it down into cases, I ensured that I accounted for all possibilities without overcounting or undercounting.Another way to think about it is:Total number of ways without any restrictions: C(3,2) * C(3,2) * 4! = 3 * 3 * 24 = 216.But this includes numbers where 0 is in the first position, which are invalid. So, we need to subtract those.Number of invalid numbers where 0 is first: Choose 0 as the first digit, then choose 1 odd and 1 even from the remaining numbers.Wait, actually, let's see:If 0 is fixed as the first digit, then we need to choose 2 odd numbers from 3 and 1 even number from the remaining 2 evens (since 0 is already used). Then, arrange the remaining 3 digits.So, number of invalid numbers: C(3,2) * C(2,1) * 3! = 3 * 2 * 6 = 36.Therefore, total valid numbers: 216 - 36 = 180.Yes, that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that 180 is correct.So, I'm confident that the answer is 180."},{"question":"Given that a > 0 and a neq 1, let proposition p be: the function y = log_a(x + 1) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0, +infty); and proposition q be: the curve y = x^2 + (2a - 3)x + 1 intersects the x-axis at two distinct points. If p or q is true and p and q are both false, find the range of values for a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of values for ( a ) given some conditions about two propositions, ( p ) and ( q ). Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand what each proposition is saying.Proposition ( p ): The function ( y = log_a(x + 1) ) is monotonically decreasing in the interval ( (0, +infty) ).Proposition ( q ): The curve ( y = x^2 + (2a - 3)x + 1 ) intersects the ( x )-axis at two distinct points.The problem states that \\"if ( p ) or ( q ) is true and ( p ) and ( q ) are both false, find the range of values for ( a ).\\" Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again.It says that either ( p ) or ( q ) is true, but both ( p ) and ( q ) cannot be true at the same time. So, essentially, one of them must be true, and the other must be false. That means we have two cases to consider:1. ( p ) is true, and ( q ) is false.2. ( p ) is false, and ( q ) is true.So, I need to analyze both cases and find the corresponding ranges for ( a ) in each case, then combine them.Let me start with proposition ( p ).**Analyzing Proposition ( p ):**The function is ( y = log_a(x + 1) ). The logarithmic function ( log_a(z) ) is monotonically decreasing if the base ( a ) is between 0 and 1. If ( a > 1 ), the logarithmic function is monotonically increasing.So, for ( y = log_a(x + 1) ) to be monotonically decreasing in ( (0, +infty) ), the base ( a ) must satisfy ( 0 < a < 1 ).Therefore, proposition ( p ) is true when ( 0 < a < 1 ), and false otherwise.**Analyzing Proposition ( q ):**The curve is a quadratic equation ( y = x^2 + (2a - 3)x + 1 ). For this quadratic to intersect the ( x )-axis at two distinct points, the discriminant must be positive.The discriminant ( D ) of a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by ( D = b^2 - 4ac ).In our case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = (2a - 3) ), and ( c = 1 ). So,( D = (2a - 3)^2 - 4(1)(1) = (2a - 3)^2 - 4 ).We need ( D > 0 ) for two distinct real roots.Let's compute ( D ):( D = (2a - 3)^2 - 4 = 4a^2 - 12a + 9 - 4 = 4a^2 - 12a + 5 ).We need ( 4a^2 - 12a + 5 > 0 ).Let me solve the inequality ( 4a^2 - 12a + 5 > 0 ).First, find the roots of the quadratic equation ( 4a^2 - 12a + 5 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:( a = frac{12 pm sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot 5}}{2 cdot 4} = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 80}}{8} = frac{12 pm sqrt{64}}{8} = frac{12 pm 8}{8} ).So, the roots are:( a = frac{12 + 8}{8} = frac{20}{8} = frac{5}{2} ),and( a = frac{12 - 8}{8} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} ).So, the quadratic ( 4a^2 - 12a + 5 ) factors as ( 4(a - frac{1}{2})(a - frac{5}{2}) ).Since the coefficient of ( a^2 ) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is positive outside the interval ( [frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{2}] ).So, ( D > 0 ) when ( a < frac{1}{2} ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ).Therefore, proposition ( q ) is true when ( a < frac{1}{2} ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ), and false otherwise.**Now, let's summarize:**- ( p ) is true when ( 0 < a < 1 ).- ( q ) is true when ( a < frac{1}{2} ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ).We need to find the values of ( a ) where exactly one of ( p ) or ( q ) is true.So, two cases:1. ( p ) is true, and ( q ) is false.2. ( p ) is false, and ( q ) is true.Let's handle each case.**Case 1: ( p ) is true, ( q ) is false.**- ( p ) is true: ( 0 < a < 1 ).- ( q ) is false: ( frac{1}{2} leq a leq frac{5}{2} ).So, the overlap where both conditions are satisfied is ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ).Because ( a ) must be in ( 0 < a < 1 ) for ( p ) to be true, and in ( frac{1}{2} leq a leq frac{5}{2} ) for ( q ) to be false. The intersection is ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ).**Case 2: ( p ) is false, ( q ) is true.**- ( p ) is false: ( a leq 0 ) or ( a geq 1 ). But since ( a > 0 ) and ( a neq 1 ), this simplifies to ( a geq 1 ).- ( q ) is true: ( a < frac{1}{2} ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ).So, the overlap where both conditions are satisfied is ( a > frac{5}{2} ).Because ( a geq 1 ) for ( p ) to be false, and ( a > frac{5}{2} ) for ( q ) to be true. The intersection is ( a > frac{5}{2} ).**Combining both cases:**From Case 1: ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ).From Case 2: ( a > frac{5}{2} ).Therefore, the range of values for ( a ) is ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ).Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For ( p ), when ( 0 < a < 1 ), the log function is decreasing. That seems correct.For ( q ), discriminant condition: ( D > 0 ) when ( a < frac{1}{2} ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ). That also seems correct.Then, for the cases:1. When ( p ) is true, ( a ) is between 0 and 1. But ( q ) is false when ( a ) is between ( frac{1}{2} ) and ( frac{5}{2} ). So, overlapping region is ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ). That makes sense.2. When ( p ) is false, ( a ) is greater than or equal to 1. But ( q ) is true when ( a ) is less than ( frac{1}{2} ) or greater than ( frac{5}{2} ). Since ( a ) is already greater than or equal to 1, the overlapping region is ( a > frac{5}{2} ). That also makes sense.So, combining these two intervals, the solution is ( frac{1}{2} leq a < 1 ) or ( a > frac{5}{2} ).I think that's correct.**Final Answer**The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{left[frac{1}{2}, 1right) cup left(frac{5}{2}, +inftyright)}."},{"question":"Ezra drew a white line that was 7.678934 inches long.

It's a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem mentions a curve C with parametric equations:[begin{cases}x = sqrt{3}costheta y = sinthetaend{cases}]where (theta) is the parameter. I remember that parametric equations define x and y in terms of a third variable, which here is (theta). So, this curve is probably some kind of ellipse or circle because of the cosine and sine functions. Let me check that.If I eliminate the parameter (theta), I can find the rectangular (Cartesian) equation of the curve. Since (x = sqrt{3}costheta), I can solve for (costheta = frac{x}{sqrt{3}}). Similarly, (y = sintheta) gives (sintheta = y). I know that (cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1), so substituting the expressions above, I get:[left(frac{x}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 + y^2 = 1]Simplifying that:[frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1]Okay, so that's an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis (sqrt{3}) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 1 along the y-axis. Got it.Now, the problem also mentions a polar coordinate system with the origin O as the pole and the positive x-axis as the polar axis. The polar equation of the straight line (l) is given as:[rho sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = 1]I need to find the rectangular coordinate equation of this line for part (1). Hmm, polar to rectangular conversion. I remember that in polar coordinates, (rho sin(theta + phi)) can be converted using the sine addition formula.Let me recall the sine addition formula:[sin(theta + phi) = sintheta cosphi + costheta sinphi]So, substituting (phi = frac{pi}{4}), we have:[sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = sintheta cosfrac{pi}{4} + costheta sinfrac{pi}{4}]I know that (cosfrac{pi}{4} = sinfrac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), so:[sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sintheta + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} costheta]Therefore, the polar equation becomes:[rho left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sintheta + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} costheta right) = 1]Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:[rho left( sqrt{2} sintheta + sqrt{2} costheta right) = 2]But wait, in polar coordinates, (rho costheta = x) and (rho sintheta = y). So substituting these in:[sqrt{2} y + sqrt{2} x = 2]I can factor out (sqrt{2}):[sqrt{2}(x + y) = 2]Divide both sides by (sqrt{2}):[x + y = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}]So, the rectangular equation of line (l) is:[x + y = sqrt{2}]That seems straightforward. So, part (1) is done. Now, moving on to part (2).The line (l) intersects the y-axis at point P. I need to find (|PB| cdot |PA|), where A and B are the intersection points of line (l) and curve C.First, let's find point P. The y-axis is where (x = 0). So, substituting (x = 0) into the equation of line (l):[0 + y = sqrt{2} implies y = sqrt{2}]So, point P is at ((0, sqrt{2})).Now, I need to find points A and B where line (l) intersects curve C. Curve C is the ellipse (frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1), and line (l) is (x + y = sqrt{2}).To find the intersection points, I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me express (y) from the line equation:[y = sqrt{2} - x]Substitute this into the ellipse equation:[frac{x^2}{3} + (sqrt{2} - x)^2 = 1]Let me expand ((sqrt{2} - x)^2):[(sqrt{2} - x)^2 = 2 - 2sqrt{2}x + x^2]So, substituting back:[frac{x^2}{3} + 2 - 2sqrt{2}x + x^2 = 1]Combine like terms. First, let's get all terms on one side:[frac{x^2}{3} + x^2 - 2sqrt{2}x + 2 - 1 = 0]Simplify:[frac{x^2}{3} + x^2 - 2sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0]Combine the (x^2) terms. (frac{x^2}{3} + x^2 = frac{x^2}{3} + frac{3x^2}{3} = frac{4x^2}{3}). So:[frac{4x^2}{3} - 2sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0]Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:[4x^2 - 6sqrt{2}x + 3 = 0]So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of (x):[4x^2 - 6sqrt{2}x + 3 = 0]Let me try to solve this quadratic. The quadratic formula is:[x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Here, (a = 4), (b = -6sqrt{2}), and (c = 3). Plugging these in:[x = frac{6sqrt{2} pm sqrt{( -6sqrt{2})^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot 3}}{2 cdot 4}]Calculate discriminant (D):[D = (6sqrt{2})^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot 3 = 72 - 48 = 24]So, square root of D is (sqrt{24} = 2sqrt{6}). Therefore:[x = frac{6sqrt{2} pm 2sqrt{6}}{8}]Factor out 2 in numerator:[x = frac{2(3sqrt{2} pm sqrt{6})}{8} = frac{3sqrt{2} pm sqrt{6}}{4}]So, the x-coordinates of points A and B are (frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4}) and (frac{3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}).Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinates using (y = sqrt{2} - x).For (x = frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4}):[y = sqrt{2} - frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4} = frac{4sqrt{2} - 3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}]So, point A is (left( frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4}, frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} right)).For (x = frac{3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}):[y = sqrt{2} - frac{3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} = frac{4sqrt{2} - 3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4}]So, point B is (left( frac{3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}, frac{sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4} right)).Now, I need to find (|PB| cdot |PA|). Point P is at ((0, sqrt{2})). So, I need to compute the distances from P to A and from P to B, then multiply them.Let me denote point A as ((x_1, y_1)) and point B as ((x_2, y_2)). So:(x_1 = frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4}), (y_1 = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4})(x_2 = frac{3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}), (y_2 = frac{sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4})Point P is ((0, sqrt{2})).First, compute (|PA|):Distance formula:[|PA| = sqrt{(x_1 - 0)^2 + (y_1 - sqrt{2})^2}]Compute each term:(x_1^2 = left( frac{3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}{4} right)^2 = frac{(3sqrt{2})^2 + 2 cdot 3sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{6} + (sqrt{6})^2}{16})Calculate numerator:((3sqrt{2})^2 = 9 cdot 2 = 18)(2 cdot 3sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{6} = 6 cdot sqrt{12} = 6 cdot 2sqrt{3} = 12sqrt{3})((sqrt{6})^2 = 6)So, numerator is (18 + 12sqrt{3} + 6 = 24 + 12sqrt{3})Thus, (x_1^2 = frac{24 + 12sqrt{3}}{16} = frac{24}{16} + frac{12sqrt{3}}{16} = frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4})Now, compute ((y_1 - sqrt{2})^2):(y_1 = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}), so (y_1 - sqrt{2} = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} - sqrt{2} = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6} - 4sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{-3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4})Thus, ((y_1 - sqrt{2})^2 = left( frac{-3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} right)^2 = frac{( -3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6} )^2}{16})Expanding the numerator:(( -3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6} )^2 = (3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6})^2 = (3sqrt{2})^2 + 2 cdot 3sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{6} + (sqrt{6})^2)Which is the same as before: 18 + 12√3 + 6 = 24 + 12√3Thus, ((y_1 - sqrt{2})^2 = frac{24 + 12sqrt{3}}{16} = frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4})Therefore, (|PA| = sqrt{ left( frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} right) + left( frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} right) } = sqrt{ 3 + frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} })Wait, hold on. That seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.Wait, actually, when I calculated (x_1^2) and ((y_1 - sqrt{2})^2), both turned out to be (frac{24 + 12sqrt{3}}{16}), which simplifies to (frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}). So, adding them together:[x_1^2 + (y_1 - sqrt{2})^2 = left( frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} right) + left( frac{3}{2} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} right) = 3 + frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}]So, (|PA| = sqrt{3 + frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}}). Hmm, that still looks complicated. Maybe I should compute it numerically to check, but perhaps there's a better way.Alternatively, maybe instead of computing each distance separately, I can use the power of a point. Since P lies on the y-axis and line l intersects the ellipse at A and B, the product |PA| * |PB| is equal to the power of point P with respect to the ellipse.But wait, power of a point is usually defined with respect to a circle. For an ellipse, it's a bit more complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, since I have the parametric equations of the line and the ellipse, perhaps I can parameterize the line and substitute into the ellipse equation, then use the quadratic equation's roots to find the product |PA| * |PB|.Wait, that might be a better approach. Let me try that.So, let's parameterize line l. Since it's a straight line, I can express it in parametric form. Let me choose a parameter t such that when t = 0, we are at point P, which is (0, √2). Then, the direction vector of line l can be found from its slope.From the equation x + y = √2, the slope is -1, so the direction vector can be (1, -1). So, the parametric equations can be written as:x = 0 + t * 1 = ty = √2 + t * (-1) = √2 - tSo, parametric equations:[begin{cases}x = t y = sqrt{2} - tend{cases}]Now, substitute these into the ellipse equation (frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1):[frac{t^2}{3} + (sqrt{2} - t)^2 = 1]Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier! So, expanding:[frac{t^2}{3} + 2 - 2sqrt{2}t + t^2 = 1]Combine terms:[frac{4t^2}{3} - 2sqrt{2}t + 1 = 0]Multiply by 3:[4t^2 - 6sqrt{2}t + 3 = 0]Which is the same quadratic as before. So, the roots of this quadratic are the parameter values t1 and t2 corresponding to points A and B.In the parametric equations, t represents the parameter along the line. So, the distances from P (which is at t = 0) to A and B are |t1| and |t2|, respectively.But wait, actually, in parametric terms, the parameter t doesn't necessarily represent distance unless the direction vector is a unit vector. In our case, the direction vector is (1, -1), which has a length of √(1 + 1) = √2. So, the actual distance from P to a point on the line is |t| * √2.But since we're dealing with the product |PA| * |PB|, which would be |t1 * t2| * (√2)^2 = |t1 * t2| * 2.Wait, let me think carefully.The parametric equations are:x = ty = √2 - tSo, the parameter t is not the actual distance from P, but rather a scalar multiple along the direction vector (1, -1). The actual distance from P to a point with parameter t is |t| * ||direction vector||.The direction vector is (1, -1), whose magnitude is √(1 + 1) = √2. So, the distance from P to a point on the line is |t| * √2.Therefore, |PA| = |t1| * √2 and |PB| = |t2| * √2.Thus, |PA| * |PB| = (|t1| * √2) * (|t2| * √2) = |t1 * t2| * 2.From the quadratic equation, the product of the roots t1 * t2 is c/a = 3/4.So, |t1 * t2| = 3/4.Therefore, |PA| * |PB| = (3/4) * 2 = 3/2.So, the product |PA| * |PB| is 3/2.Wait, that seems much cleaner. So, instead of computing each distance separately, which was getting messy, I can use the property of quadratic equations where the product of the roots is c/a, and then account for the scaling factor due to the parametrization.Therefore, the answer is 3/2.I think that's the correct approach. Let me just recap:1. Converted the polar equation to rectangular form, got x + y = √2.2. Found point P at (0, √2).3. Solved for intersection points A and B by substituting y = √2 - x into the ellipse equation, leading to a quadratic in x.4. Recognized that the product |PA| * |PB| can be found using the power of point P with respect to the ellipse, but realized it's more straightforward to parameterize the line and use the quadratic roots' product.5. Parameterized the line with t, substituted into the ellipse, found the quadratic in t, noted that the product of the roots t1 * t2 is 3/4.6. Since the parameter t scales with the direction vector's magnitude √2, the actual distances |PA| and |PB| are |t1| * √2 and |t2| * √2, so their product is |t1 * t2| * 2 = (3/4) * 2 = 3/2.Therefore, the final answer is 3/2.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{3}{2}}"},{"question":"What is the least positive whole number divisible by five different prime numbers?","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive whole number that's divisible by five different prime numbers. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably figure out what the smallest prime numbers are because using smaller primes will likely give me a smaller overall product. Alright, the prime numbers start from 2, right? So the sequence of prime numbers is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since I need five different prime numbers, I should take the first five in this sequence. That would be 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Now, to find a number that's divisible by all of these, I think I need to multiply them together. Multiplying primes together gives the smallest number that has all of them as factors because primes don't share any common factors other than 1. So, if I multiply 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11, that should give me the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers, which is the smallest number divisible by all of them.Let me do the multiplication step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. Starting with 2 × 3, that's 6. Then, 6 × 5 is 30. Next, 30 × 7 is 210. Finally, 210 × 11. Hmm, 210 × 10 is 2100, and adding another 210 gives me 2310. So, the product is 2310.Wait, is there a smaller number that's divisible by five different primes? Let me think. If I tried using a smaller prime instead of 11, but 11 is already the fifth smallest prime. If I skipped 11 and took a larger prime, the product would only get bigger. So, using the first five primes gives me the smallest possible product.Just to double-check, let's see if 2310 is indeed divisible by all five primes. Dividing 2310 by 2 gives 1155, which is a whole number. Dividing by 3 gives 770, also a whole number. Dividing by 5 gives 462, which is fine. Dividing by 7 gives 330, and dividing by 11 gives 210. All of these are whole numbers, so yes, 2310 is divisible by each of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.Is there any way to get a smaller number? Maybe by using exponents or something? Wait, no, because if I use exponents on any of the primes, that would make the number larger, not smaller. For example, if I took 2² instead of 2, that would be 4, and multiplying that with the others would give a larger product. So, using each prime once is the way to go.Another thought: could I use a composite number instead of one of the primes? For instance, replacing 11 with a composite number that's smaller? But wait, composite numbers are products of primes, so if I use a composite number, I'd still have to include its prime factors, which might not necessarily give me a smaller product. Plus, the problem specifies that the number must be divisible by five different prime numbers, so using a composite number wouldn't add a new prime factor but would complicate things.So, to sum it up, the smallest positive whole number divisible by five different prime numbers is the product of the five smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Multiplying them together gives 2310, and I've verified that this number is indeed divisible by all five primes without any remainder. I don't think there's a smaller number that meets the criteria because any smaller product would miss out on one of these primes or include a larger prime, which would only increase the overall product.Therefore, I'm confident that 2310 is the correct answer."},{"question":"For which values of p and q, where both are strictly positive integers, does p q divide 3(p-1)(q-1)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: For which values of ( p ) and ( q ), where both are strictly positive integers, does ( pq ) divide ( 3(p-1)(q-1) )? Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I need to understand what it means for ( pq ) to divide ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ). In mathematical terms, this means that ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) is a multiple of ( pq ). So, ( pq ) must be a factor of ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ). That implies that when we divide ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) by ( pq ), the result should be an integer.Let me write that down:[frac{3(p-1)(q-1)}{pq} text{ is an integer}]Simplifying this expression might help. Let me expand the numerator:[3(p-1)(q-1) = 3(pq - p - q + 1)]So, substituting back into the fraction:[frac{3(pq - p - q + 1)}{pq} = 3 - frac{3p}{pq} - frac{3q}{pq} + frac{3}{pq}]Simplifying each term:[3 - frac{3}{q} - frac{3}{p} + frac{3}{pq}]Hmm, so for this entire expression to be an integer, each of the fractional terms must combine in such a way that the result is an integer. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers, ( frac{3}{q} ), ( frac{3}{p} ), and ( frac{3}{pq} ) must all be fractions that, when subtracted from 3, result in an integer.This suggests that ( frac{3}{q} ) and ( frac{3}{p} ) must be fractions that, when subtracted, leave an integer. So, ( frac{3}{q} ) and ( frac{3}{p} ) must themselves be fractions that can combine to give a fractional part that cancels out, leaving an integer.Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the original condition ( pq mid 3(p-1)(q-1) ). This means that ( pq ) divides ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ), so ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) must be a multiple of ( pq ). Therefore, there exists some integer ( k ) such that:[3(p-1)(q-1) = k cdot pq]So, ( k ) must be a positive integer because both ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers, and ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) is also positive.Let me rearrange this equation:[3(p-1)(q-1) = kpq]Expanding the left side:[3(pq - p - q + 1) = kpq]Which simplifies to:[3pq - 3p - 3q + 3 = kpq]Let me bring all terms to one side:[3pq - kpq - 3p - 3q + 3 = 0]Factor out ( pq ):[pq(3 - k) - 3p - 3q + 3 = 0]Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach would be better. Let's consider the ratio:[frac{3(p-1)(q-1)}{pq} = frac{3(pq - p - q + 1)}{pq} = 3 - frac{3}{q} - frac{3}{p} + frac{3}{pq}]As I thought earlier, for this to be an integer, the fractional parts must add up to an integer. Let me denote this integer as ( k ), so:[3 - frac{3}{q} - frac{3}{p} + frac{3}{pq} = k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[frac{3}{q} + frac{3}{p} - frac{3}{pq} = 3 - k]Let me factor out the 3:[3left( frac{1}{q} + frac{1}{p} - frac{1}{pq} right) = 3 - k]Divide both sides by 3:[frac{1}{q} + frac{1}{p} - frac{1}{pq} = 1 - frac{k}{3}]Hmm, this might not be the most straightforward path. Maybe I should consider specific cases or look for bounds on ( p ) and ( q ).Since ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers, let's assume without loss of generality that ( p leq q ). This way, I can limit the number of cases I need to consider.Let me also note that ( p ) and ( q ) must be greater than 1 because if either ( p ) or ( q ) is 1, then ( pq = q ) or ( pq = p ), and ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) would be zero, which isn't divisible by a positive integer. So, ( p geq 2 ) and ( q geq 2 ).Now, let's consider small values of ( p ) and see what ( q ) can be.**Case 1: ( p = 2 )**Plugging ( p = 2 ) into the equation:[3(2 - 1)(q - 1) = 3(1)(q - 1) = 3(q - 1)]We need ( 2q ) to divide ( 3(q - 1) ). So:[2q mid 3(q - 1)]Which implies that ( 2q ) divides ( 3(q - 1) ). Let's write this as:[3(q - 1) = 2q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[3q - 3 = 2qk][3q - 2qk = 3][q(3 - 2k) = 3]Since ( q ) is a positive integer, ( 3 - 2k ) must divide 3. Let's find possible values of ( k ):( 3 - 2k ) must be a positive divisor of 3. The positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3.So:1. If ( 3 - 2k = 1 ), then ( 2k = 2 ) ⇒ ( k = 1 ). Then ( q = 3 / 1 = 3 ).2. If ( 3 - 2k = 3 ), then ( 2k = 0 ) ⇒ ( k = 0 ). But ( k ) must be positive, so this is invalid.Thus, the only solution when ( p = 2 ) is ( q = 3 ).Let me check this:( pq = 2 times 3 = 6 )( 3(p - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 1 times 2 = 6 )Indeed, 6 divides 6. So, ( (2, 3) ) is a solution.**Case 2: ( p = 3 )**Plugging ( p = 3 ):[3(3 - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 2 times (q - 1) = 6(q - 1)]We need ( 3q ) to divide ( 6(q - 1) ). So:[3q mid 6(q - 1)]Simplify:[q mid 2(q - 1)]Which implies:[2(q - 1) = q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[2q - 2 = qk][2q - qk = 2][q(2 - k) = 2]So, ( 2 - k ) must be a positive divisor of 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.1. If ( 2 - k = 1 ), then ( k = 1 ). Then ( q = 2 / 1 = 2 ).2. If ( 2 - k = 2 ), then ( k = 0 ). But ( k ) must be positive, so invalid.Thus, the only solution when ( p = 3 ) is ( q = 2 ).Check:( pq = 3 times 2 = 6 )( 3(p - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 )Again, 6 divides 6. So, ( (3, 2) ) is a solution. But since ( p ) and ( q ) are interchangeable, this is essentially the same as the previous solution.**Case 3: ( p = 4 )**Plugging ( p = 4 ):[3(4 - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 3 times (q - 1) = 9(q - 1)]We need ( 4q ) to divide ( 9(q - 1) ). So:[4q mid 9(q - 1)]Which implies:[9(q - 1) = 4q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[9q - 9 = 4qk][9q - 4qk = 9][q(9 - 4k) = 9]So, ( 9 - 4k ) must be a positive divisor of 9. The positive divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9.1. If ( 9 - 4k = 1 ), then ( 4k = 8 ) ⇒ ( k = 2 ). Then ( q = 9 / 1 = 9 ).2. If ( 9 - 4k = 3 ), then ( 4k = 6 ) ⇒ ( k = 1.5 ). Not an integer, so invalid.3. If ( 9 - 4k = 9 ), then ( 4k = 0 ) ⇒ ( k = 0 ). Invalid.Thus, the only solution when ( p = 4 ) is ( q = 9 ).Check:( pq = 4 times 9 = 36 )( 3(p - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 3 times 8 = 72 )Indeed, 36 divides 72. So, ( (4, 9) ) is a solution.**Case 4: ( p = 5 )**Plugging ( p = 5 ):[3(5 - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 4 times (q - 1) = 12(q - 1)]We need ( 5q ) to divide ( 12(q - 1) ). So:[5q mid 12(q - 1)]Which implies:[12(q - 1) = 5q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[12q - 12 = 5qk][12q - 5qk = 12][q(12 - 5k) = 12]So, ( 12 - 5k ) must be a positive divisor of 12. The positive divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.Let's check each:1. ( 12 - 5k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 11 ) ⇒ ( k = 11/5 ). Not integer.2. ( 12 - 5k = 2 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 10 ) ⇒ ( k = 2 ). Then ( q = 12 / 2 = 6 ).3. ( 12 - 5k = 3 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 9 ) ⇒ ( k = 9/5 ). Not integer.4. ( 12 - 5k = 4 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 8 ) ⇒ ( k = 8/5 ). Not integer.5. ( 12 - 5k = 6 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 6 ) ⇒ ( k = 6/5 ). Not integer.6. ( 12 - 5k = 12 ) ⇒ ( 5k = 0 ) ⇒ ( k = 0 ). Invalid.Thus, the only solution when ( p = 5 ) is ( q = 6 ).Check:( pq = 5 times 6 = 30 )( 3(p - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 4 times 5 = 60 )Indeed, 30 divides 60. So, ( (5, 6) ) is a solution.**Case 5: ( p = 6 )**Plugging ( p = 6 ):[3(6 - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 5 times (q - 1) = 15(q - 1)]We need ( 6q ) to divide ( 15(q - 1) ). So:[6q mid 15(q - 1)]Simplify:[15(q - 1) = 6q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[15q - 15 = 6qk][15q - 6qk = 15][q(15 - 6k) = 15]So, ( 15 - 6k ) must be a positive divisor of 15. The positive divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.1. ( 15 - 6k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 6k = 14 ) ⇒ ( k = 14/6 = 7/3 ). Not integer.2. ( 15 - 6k = 3 ) ⇒ ( 6k = 12 ) ⇒ ( k = 2 ). Then ( q = 15 / 3 = 5 ).3. ( 15 - 6k = 5 ) ⇒ ( 6k = 10 ) ⇒ ( k = 10/6 = 5/3 ). Not integer.4. ( 15 - 6k = 15 ) ⇒ ( 6k = 0 ) ⇒ ( k = 0 ). Invalid.Thus, the only solution when ( p = 6 ) is ( q = 5 ).Check:( pq = 6 times 5 = 30 )( 3(p - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 5 times 4 = 60 )Indeed, 30 divides 60. So, ( (6, 5) ) is a solution.**Case 6: ( p = 7 )**Plugging ( p = 7 ):[3(7 - 1)(q - 1) = 3 times 6 times (q - 1) = 18(q - 1)]We need ( 7q ) to divide ( 18(q - 1) ). So:[7q mid 18(q - 1)]Which implies:[18(q - 1) = 7q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[18q - 18 = 7qk][18q - 7qk = 18][q(18 - 7k) = 18]So, ( 18 - 7k ) must be a positive divisor of 18. The positive divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.Let's check each:1. ( 18 - 7k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 7k = 17 ) ⇒ ( k = 17/7 ). Not integer.2. ( 18 - 7k = 2 ) ⇒ ( 7k = 16 ) ⇒ ( k = 16/7 ). Not integer.3. ( 18 - 7k = 3 ) ⇒ ( 7k = 15 ) ⇒ ( k = 15/7 ). Not integer.4.

So:[8q mid 21(q - 1)]Which implies:[21(q - 1) = 8q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[21q - 21 = 8qk][21q - 8qk = 21][q(21 - 8k) = 21]So, ( 21 - 8k ) must be a positive divisor of 21. The positive divisors of 21 are 1, 3, 7, 21.1. ( 21 - 8k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 8k = 20 ) ⇒ ( k = 2.5 ). Not integer.2. ( 21 - 8k = 3 ) ⇒ ( 8k = 18 ) ⇒ ( k = 2.25 ). Not integer.3. ( 21 - 8k = 7 ) ⇒ ( 8k = 14 ) ⇒ ( k = 1.75 ). Not integer.4.

So:[9q mid 24(q - 1)]Simplify:[24(q - 1) = 9q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[24q - 24 = 9qk][24q - 9qk = 24][q(24 - 9k) = 24]So, ( 24 - 9k ) must be a positive divisor of 24. The positive divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.Let's check each:1. ( 24 - 9k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 9k = 23 ) ⇒ ( k = 23/9 ). Not integer.2. ( 24 - 9k = 2 ) ⇒ ( 9k = 22 ) ⇒ ( k = 22/9 ). Not integer.3.

So:[10q mid 27(q - 1)]Which implies:[27(q - 1) = 10q cdot k]Where ( k ) is a positive integer. Rearranging:[27q - 27 = 10qk][27q - 10qk = 27][q(27 - 10k) = 27]So, ( 27 - 10k ) must be a positive divisor of 27. The positive divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, 27.1. ( 27 - 10k = 1 ) ⇒ ( 10k = 26 ) ⇒ ( k = 2.6 ). Not integer.2. ( 27 - 10k = 3 ) ⇒ ( 10k = 24 ) ⇒ ( k = 2.4 ). Not integer.3. ( 27 - 10k = 9 ) ⇒ ( 10k = 18 ) ⇒ ( k = 1.8 ). Not integer.4. ( 27 - 10k = 27 ) ⇒ ( 10k = 0 ) ⇒ ( k = 0 ). Invalid.Thus, no solutions when ( p = 10 ).At this point, I notice a pattern. The solutions we've found so far are ( (2, 3) ), ( (3, 2) ), ( (4, 9) ), ( (5, 6) ), ( (6, 5) ), ( (9, 4) ). It seems that beyond a certain point, the values of ( p ) and ( q ) don't yield new solutions because the required conditions become too restrictive.Let me consider whether there could be larger values of ( p ) and ( q ) that satisfy the condition. Suppose ( p ) is very large. Then ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) would be approximately ( 3pq ), so ( pq ) would divide ( 3pq ), which is true for any ( p ) and ( q ). But wait, that's not necessarily the case because ( 3(p-1)(q-1) ) is slightly less than ( 3pq ). So, the ratio ( frac{3(p-1)(q-1)}{pq} ) is slightly less than 3. For this ratio to be an integer, it must be 1 or 2.Wait, that's an important point. Let me think about it. The ratio ( frac{3(p-1)(q-1)}{pq} ) must be an integer, say ( k ). So:[k = frac{3(p-1)(q-1)}{pq}]Which can be rewritten as:[k = 3 left(1 - frac{1}{p}right)left(1 - frac{1}{q}right)]Since ( p ) and ( q ) are greater than 1, ( left(1 - frac{1}{p}right) ) and ( left(1 - frac{1}{q}right) ) are both less than 1. Therefore, ( k ) must be less than 3. So, ( k ) can only be 1 or 2.This is a crucial observation. So, the ratio must be either 1 or 2. Therefore, we can set up two equations:1. ( 3(p-1)(q-1) = pq )2. ( 3(p-1)(q-1) = 2pq )Let me analyze each case separately.**Subcase 1: ( 3(p-1)(q-1) = pq )**Expanding:[3pq - 3p - 3q + 3 = pq]Bringing all terms to one side:[2pq - 3p - 3q + 3 = 0]Let me rearrange:[2pq - 3p - 3q = -3]Hmm, this is a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it. Let me try adding 9/2 to both sides to complete the rectangle.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT). Let me rewrite the equation:[2pq - 3p - 3q = -3]Multiply both sides by 2 to make the coefficients of ( pq ) even:[4pq - 6p - 6q = -6]Now, add 9 to both sides:[4pq - 6p - 6q + 9 = 3]Factor the left side:[(2p - 3)(2q - 3) = 3]Ah, that's much better! So, we have:[(2p - 3)(2q - 3) = 3]Since ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers, ( 2p - 3 ) and ( 2q - 3 ) must be positive integers as well. The positive integer factors of 3 are 1 and 3.So, we have two possibilities:1. ( 2p - 3 = 1 ) and ( 2q - 3 = 3 )2. ( 2p - 3 = 3 ) and ( 2q - 3 = 1 )Let's solve each:1. ( 2p - 3 = 1 ) ⇒ ( 2p = 4 ) ⇒ ( p = 2 )   ( 2q - 3 = 3 ) ⇒ ( 2q = 6 ) ⇒ ( q = 3 )      So, ( (p, q) = (2, 3) )2. ( 2p - 3 = 3 ) ⇒ ( 2p = 6 ) ⇒ ( p = 3 )   ( 2q - 3 = 1 ) ⇒ ( 2q = 4 ) ⇒ ( q = 2 )      So, ( (p, q) = (3, 2) )These are the solutions we found earlier.**Subcase 2: ( 3(p-1)(q-1) = 2pq )**Expanding:[3pq - 3p - 3q + 3 = 2pq]Bringing all terms to one side:[pq - 3p - 3q + 3 = 0]Again, let's try SFFT. Rearrange:[pq - 3p - 3q = -3]Add 9 to both sides:[pq - 3p - 3q + 9 = 6]Factor the left side:[(p - 3)(q - 3) = 6]Great! Now, ( p - 3 ) and ( q - 3 ) are positive integers (since ( p geq 4 ) and ( q geq 4 ) in this case) whose product is 6. The positive integer pairs that multiply to 6 are:1. ( (1, 6) )2. ( (2, 3) )3. ( (3, 2) )4. ( (6, 1) )Let's solve for each pair:1. ( p - 3 = 1 ) ⇒ ( p = 4 )   ( q - 3 = 6 ) ⇒ ( q = 9 )      So, ( (p, q) = (4, 9) )2. ( p - 3 = 2 ) ⇒ ( p = 5 )   ( q - 3 = 3 ) ⇒ ( q = 6 )      So, ( (p, q) = (5, 6) )3. ( p - 3 = 3 ) ⇒ ( p = 6 )   ( q - 3 = 2 ) ⇒ ( q = 5 )      So, ( (p, q) = (6, 5) )4. ( p - 3 = 6 ) ⇒ ( p = 9 )   ( q - 3 = 1 ) ⇒ ( q = 4 )      So, ( (p, q) = (9, 4) )These are the other solutions we found earlier.So, combining both subcases, the solutions are:- ( (2, 3) )- ( (3, 2) )- ( (4, 9) )- ( (5, 6) )- ( (6, 5) )- ( (9, 4) )Since ( p ) and ( q ) are interchangeable, these are all the possible solutions.I think I've covered all possible cases and used both direct substitution and algebraic manipulation to find the solutions. It seems comprehensive, and I don't see any gaps in the reasoning. The key was realizing that the ratio must be an integer less than 3, which limited the possible values significantly."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate plane (xOy), find the standard equation of the circle with the largest radius among all circles that are tangent to the line 2mx - y - 4m + 1 = 0 (m in mathbb{R}) and have their center at point (1, 0).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the standard equation of the circle with the largest radius among all circles that are tangent to the line (2mx - y - 4m + 1 = 0) where (m) is a real number, and the center of the circle is at the point ((1, 0)). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the standard equation of a circle with center ((h, k)) and radius (r) is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2). In this case, the center is given as ((1, 0)), so the equation would be ((x - 1)^2 + y^2 = r^2). My task is to find the largest possible (r) such that the circle is tangent to the given line.Now, tangency between a circle and a line means that the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle. So, if I can find the distance from the center ((1, 0)) to the line (2mx - y - 4m + 1 = 0), that distance will be the radius (r). But since the line depends on the parameter (m), I need to find the maximum possible distance (r) as (m) varies over all real numbers.The formula for the distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (Ax + By + C = 0) is:[d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}]So, let me rewrite the given line equation in the standard form (Ax + By + C = 0). The given line is (2mx - y - 4m + 1 = 0). Comparing this to (Ax + By + C = 0), I can see that (A = 2m), (B = -1), and (C = -4m + 1).Now, plugging the center ((1, 0)) into the distance formula:[d = frac{|2m cdot 1 + (-1) cdot 0 + (-4m + 1)|}{sqrt{(2m)^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|2m - 4m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}} = frac{|-2m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}}]So, the distance (d) from the center to the line is (frac{|-2m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}}). This distance is equal to the radius (r) of the circle. Therefore, (r = frac{|-2m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}}).Now, I need to find the maximum value of (r) as (m) varies over all real numbers. To do this, I can consider the function:[f(m) = frac{|-2m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}}]Since the absolute value function can complicate things, maybe I can square both the numerator and the denominator to make it easier to handle. Let's define:[f(m)^2 = frac{(-2m + 1)^2}{4m^2 + 1}]Simplifying the numerator:[(-2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 - 4m + 1]So,[f(m)^2 = frac{4m^2 - 4m + 1}{4m^2 + 1}]Let me denote this as:[g(m) = frac{4m^2 - 4m + 1}{4m^2 + 1}]To find the maximum of (g(m)), I can take its derivative with respect to (m) and set it equal to zero. Let's compute (g'(m)).First, write (g(m)) as:[g(m) = frac{4m^2 - 4m + 1}{4m^2 + 1}]Using the quotient rule, the derivative (g'(m)) is:[g'(m) = frac{(8m - 4)(4m^2 + 1) - (4m^2 - 4m + 1)(8m)}{(4m^2 + 1)^2}]Let me compute the numerator step by step.First, compute the derivative of the numerator:[frac{d}{dm}(4m^2 - 4m + 1) = 8m - 4]Multiply this by the denominator (4m^2 + 1):[(8m - 4)(4m^2 + 1) = 8m cdot 4m^2 + 8m cdot 1 - 4 cdot 4m^2 - 4 cdot 1 = 32m^3 + 8m - 16m^2 - 4]Next, compute the derivative of the denominator:[frac{d}{dm}(4m^2 + 1) = 8m]Multiply this by the numerator (4m^2 - 4m + 1):[8m cdot (4m^2 - 4m + 1) = 32m^3 - 32m^2 + 8m]Now, subtract the second product from the first product:[(32m^3 + 8m - 16m^2 - 4) - (32m^3 - 32m^2 + 8m) = 32m^3 + 8m - 16m^2 - 4 - 32m^3 + 32m^2 - 8m]Simplify term by term:- (32m^3 - 32m^3 = 0)- (8m - 8m = 0)- (-16m^2 + 32m^2 = 16m^2)- (-4) remainsSo, the numerator simplifies to:[16m^2 - 4]Therefore, the derivative (g'(m)) is:[g'(m) = frac{16m^2 - 4}{(4m^2 + 1)^2}]To find critical points, set (g'(m) = 0):[16m^2 - 4 = 0 implies 16m^2 = 4 implies m^2 = frac{4}{16} = frac{1}{4} implies m = pm frac{1}{2}]So, the critical points are at (m = frac{1}{2}) and (m = -frac{1}{2}).Now, I need to determine whether these critical points correspond to maxima or minima. Since we're looking for the maximum value of (g(m)), let's evaluate (g(m)) at these points.First, evaluate at (m = frac{1}{2}):[gleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{4left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 4left(frac{1}{2}right) + 1}{4left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 1} = frac{4 cdot frac{1}{4} - 2 + 1}{4 cdot frac{1}{4} + 1} = frac{1 - 2 + 1}{1 + 1} = frac{0}{2} = 0]Hmm, that's zero. So, that's a minimum.Now, evaluate at (m = -frac{1}{2}):[gleft(-frac{1}{2}right) = frac{4left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 4left(-frac{1}{2}right) + 1}{4left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 1} = frac{4 cdot frac{1}{4} + 2 + 1}{4 cdot frac{1}{4} + 1} = frac{1 + 2 + 1}{1 + 1} = frac{4}{2} = 2]So, (gleft(-frac{1}{2}right) = 2). That's a maximum because when I plug in other values, say (m = 0):[g(0) = frac{0 - 0 + 1}{0 + 1} = 1]Which is less than 2. Similarly, as (m) approaches infinity, the function (g(m)) approaches:[lim_{m to infty} frac{4m^2 - 4m + 1}{4m^2 + 1} = lim_{m to infty} frac{4 - frac{4}{m} + frac{1}{m^2}}{4 + frac{1}{m^2}} = frac{4}{4} = 1]So, the maximum value of (g(m)) is 2, achieved at (m = -frac{1}{2}). Therefore, the maximum value of (f(m)) is (sqrt{2}), since (f(m)^2 = g(m)).Therefore, the maximum radius (r) is (sqrt{2}).So, the standard equation of the circle is:[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2]Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started by rewriting the line equation and correctly identified (A), (B), and (C).2. Applied the distance formula correctly, leading to (d = frac{|-2m + 1|}{sqrt{4m^2 + 1}}).3. Squared the function to simplify differentiation, which is a valid approach.4. Took the derivative using the quotient rule, carefully expanded and simplified, leading to (g'(m) = frac{16m^2 - 4}{(4m^2 + 1)^2}).5. Found critical points at (m = pm frac{1}{2}).6. Evaluated (g(m)) at these points and found that (m = -frac{1}{2}) gives the maximum value of 2, so (f(m) = sqrt{2}).7. Concluded the radius is (sqrt{2}) and wrote the equation of the circle.Everything seems to check out. I think this is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The standard equation of the circle is boxed{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 2}."},{"question":"Given the circle O: x^2 + y^2 = r^2 (r > 0) and the line 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 are tangent to each other, find the value of r.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius ( r ) of a circle given by the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 ) that's tangent to the line ( 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 ) represents a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius ( r ). So, the center is at (0,0). Now, the line ( 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 ) is tangent to this circle. Tangent means that the line touches the circle at exactly one point.I recall that the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line is equal to the radius of the circle. So, if I can find the distance from the center (0,0) to the line ( 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 ), that distance should be equal to ( r ).To find the distance from a point to a line, there's a formula I remember: [d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}]Where ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is the equation of the line, and ( (x_0, y_0) ) is the point. In this case, the line is ( 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 ), so ( A = 3 ), ( B = -4 ), and ( C = 20 ). The point is the center of the circle, which is (0,0), so ( x_0 = 0 ) and ( y_0 = 0 ).Plugging these values into the formula:[d = frac{|3(0) - 4(0) + 20|}{sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2}} = frac{|0 + 0 + 20|}{sqrt{9 + 16}} = frac{20}{sqrt{25}} = frac{20}{5} = 4]So, the distance from the center to the line is 4. Since this distance is equal to the radius ( r ), that means ( r = 4 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used the distance formula correctly, substituted the values accurately, and the calculations seem right. The numerator is 20, the denominator is 5, so 20 divided by 5 is indeed 4. Just to visualize, if the circle is centered at the origin and has a radius of 4, the line ( 3x - 4y + 20 = 0 ) should just touch the circle at one point. That makes sense because the distance from the center to the line is exactly the radius, so they are tangent.I think I'm confident with this result. The radius ( r ) is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( r ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"A man can row at 5 kmph in still water. If the velocity of the current is 1 kmph and it takes him 1 hour to row to a place and come back, how far is the place?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a man rowing a boat. Let me try to understand what's going on. The man can row at 5 km per hour in still water. That means if there's no current, he can row at 5 km/h. But there is a current, and its speed is 1 km/h. So, when he's rowing downstream, the current will help him, making his effective speed faster, and when he's rowing upstream, against the current, his effective speed will be slower.The problem says it takes him 1 hour to row to a place and come back. So, he goes downstream to the place and then comes back upstream to his starting point, and the total time for this round trip is 1 hour. We need to find out how far the place is from his starting point.Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out his effective speeds when going downstream and upstream. Downstream, his speed will be his rowing speed plus the speed of the current, and upstream, it will be his rowing speed minus the speed of the current.So, downstream speed = 5 km/h + 1 km/h = 6 km/h.Upstream speed = 5 km/h - 1 km/h = 4 km/h.Now, let's denote the distance to the place as D kilometers. Since he goes to the place and comes back, the total distance he covers is 2D kilometers.But we're given the total time, not the total distance. So, I need to relate distance, speed, and time. The formula that connects these three is:Time = Distance / Speed.So, the time taken to go downstream to the place is D / 6 hours, and the time taken to come back upstream is D / 4 hours.According to the problem, the sum of these two times is 1 hour. So, I can write the equation:D / 6 + D / 4 = 1.Now, I need to solve this equation for D. To do that, I should find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 6 and 4, and the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12. So, I can rewrite the equation with 12 as the common denominator:(2D) / 12 + (3D) / 12 = 1.Combining the fractions gives:(2D + 3D) / 12 = 1.Simplifying the numerator:5D / 12 = 1.Now, to solve for D, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 12:5D = 12.Then, divide both sides by 5:D = 12 / 5.Calculating that gives:D = 2.4 kilometers.So, the place is 2.4 kilometers away from the starting point.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the speeds: downstream is 6 km/h and upstream is 4 km/h. The times are D/6 and D/4, which add up to 1 hour. Combining the fractions correctly gives 5D/12 = 1, leading to D = 12/5 = 2.4 km. Yeah, that seems right.I think I've got it. The place is 2.4 kilometers away."},{"question":"Central projection lines are ( )A: Parallel to each otherB: Intersect at one pointC: Skew linesD: In the same plane","answer":"Okay, so I have this question about central projection lines, and I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct. The options are: A) Parallel to each other, B) Intersect at one point, C) Skew lines, and D) In the same plane. First, I need to understand what central projection lines are. I remember that in geometry, there are different types of projections, like orthographic projection and central projection. Orthographic projection involves projecting points onto a plane using parallel lines, right? So, in that case, the projection lines are parallel. But central projection is different.Central projection, I think, is like projecting from a single point, kind of like how a shadow is cast from a light source. So, if you imagine a light bulb shining on an object, the light rays come out from the bulb in all directions, creating shadows on the ground. These light rays are the projection lines in central projection.So, if the projection lines are coming out from a single point, like the light bulb, then those lines must all originate from that one point. That means they all intersect at that point. So, in this case, the projection lines intersect at one point, which would be the light source or the center of projection.Now, looking at the options: A says they are parallel. But in central projection, the lines are not parallel; they all come from a single point, so they diverge from that point. So, A doesn't seem right.Option B says they intersect at one point. That matches with what I was thinking earlier. Since all the projection lines come from a single point, they all intersect at that point. So, B seems correct.Option C mentions skew lines. Skew lines are lines that are not parallel and do not intersect, typically in three-dimensional space. But in central projection, the lines do intersect at the center point, so they aren't skew. So, C doesn't apply here.Option D says they are in the same plane. Well, in central projection, the projection lines can be in different planes because they radiate out from a single point in all directions. So, they aren't confined to just one plane. Therefore, D isn't correct either.To double-check, I'll think about an example. If I have a point light source and an object, the shadow of the object on a screen is a central projection. All the light rays from the source pass through the object and hit the screen. These rays all start at the light source, so they all intersect there. They aren't parallel because they spread out from the source. They aren't skew because they do intersect at the source. And they aren't all in the same plane because the object and screen can be positioned in different planes relative to the light source.So, putting it all together, the central projection lines intersect at one point, which is the source of the projection. Therefore, the correct answer should be B."},{"question":"A factory produces 3400 toys per week.

The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots; if it's zero, there's exactly one real root; and if it's negative, there are no real roots, meaning the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis.In this problem, we're dealing with the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + k < 0 ). For this inequality to have real solutions, the quadratic must actually cross the x-axis at two distinct points. This is because if it only touches the x-axis (one real root) or doesn't cross it at all (no real roots), the quadratic won't be negative for any interval of ( x ). So, the first condition is that the discriminant must be positive.Let me calculate the discriminant for the quadratic ( x^2 - 8x + k ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -8 ), and ( c = k ). Plugging these into the discriminant formula:[text{Discriminant} = (-8)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 64 - 4k]For there to be two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:[64 - 4k > 0]Let me solve this inequality for ( k ):[64 - 4k > 0 -4k > -64]When I divide both sides by -4, I have to remember to reverse the inequality sign because I'm dividing by a negative number:[k < 16]So, ( k ) must be less than 16. But the problem specifies that ( k ) should be positive. Therefore, combining these two conditions, ( k ) must be greater than 0 and less than 16.Wait a second, let me double-check that. If ( k ) is positive and less than 16, then the quadratic will have two distinct real roots, and since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. This means the quadratic will be below the x-axis (negative) between its two roots. So, the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + k < 0 ) will indeed have real solutions for ( x ) in that interval.Is there any other condition I need to consider? Well, if ( k ) were equal to 16, the discriminant would be zero, meaning the quadratic would touch the x-axis at one point, but it wouldn't be negative anywhere. Similarly, if ( k ) were greater than 16, the discriminant would be negative, and the quadratic would never cross the x-axis, meaning it's always positive since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive. Therefore, those cases don't satisfy the inequality having real solutions.So, putting it all together, the positive values of ( k ) that satisfy the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + k < 0 ) having real solutions are those where ( k ) is between 0 and 16, not including the endpoints.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider an example. If ( k = 15 ), which is less than 16, then the quadratic becomes ( x^2 - 8x + 15 ). Factoring this, we get ( (x - 3)(x - 5) ), which has roots at ( x = 3 ) and ( x = 5 ). The quadratic is negative between 3 and 5, so the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + 15 < 0 ) is true for ( 3 < x < 5 ). That checks out.Another example: if ( k = 16 ), the quadratic becomes ( x^2 - 8x + 16 ), which factors to ( (x - 4)^2 ). This touches the x-axis at ( x = 4 ) but doesn't go below it, so the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + 16 < 0 ) has no solution. That's consistent with our earlier conclusion.And if ( k = 17 ), which is greater than 16, the quadratic ( x^2 - 8x + 17 ) has a discriminant of ( 64 - 68 = -4 ), which is negative. So, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis and is always positive. Therefore, the inequality ( x^2 - 8x + 17 < 0 ) has no solution, which again aligns with our result.I think I've covered all the necessary points. The key was recognizing that for the quadratic to be negative for some real ( x ), it must have two distinct real roots, which requires the discriminant to be positive. Combining that with the positivity of ( k ) gives the interval ( (0, 16) ).**Final Answer**The positive values of ( k ) are boxed{(0, 16)}."},{"question":"Hannah is making banana bread and needs to carefully measure her ingredients. The recipe requires 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush, 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of banana mush, and 1 cup of milk for every 6 cups of flour. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 32 bananas, how many cups of flour, sugar, and milk should she use to maintain the correct proportions?","answer":"First, determine the number of cups of banana mush Hannah can make with 32 bananas. Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush, divide 32 by 4 to get 8 cups of banana mush.Next, calculate the amount of flour needed. The recipe requires 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. Multiply 3 cups of flour by 8 cups of banana mush to get 24 cups of flour.For sugar, the recipe specifies 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of banana mush. Set up a proportion: (2 cups of sugar) / (3 cups of banana mush) = (x cups of sugar) / (8 cups of banana mush). Cross-multiply to solve for x: 2 × 8 = 3 × x, which simplifies to 16 = 3x. Divide both sides by 3 to find x ≈ 5.33 cups of sugar.Finally, determine the amount of milk needed. The recipe requires 1 cup of milk for every 6 cups of flour.

There are two parts to this problem. First, I need to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point A(1, f(1)) when a = 2. Second, I need to discuss the monotonic intervals of the function f(x). Hmm, let's tackle each part step by step.Starting with part (I). I know that to find the equation of a tangent line at a specific point, I need two things: the slope of the tangent line at that point and a point through which the tangent passes. The point is already given as A(1, f(1)), so I just need to compute f(1) when a = 2.So, substituting x = 1 and a = 2 into f(x), we get f(1) = 1 - 2 ln(1). I remember that ln(1) is 0 because e^0 = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1 - 0 = 1. So, the point A is (1, 1).Next, I need the slope of the tangent line at this point. The slope is given by the derivative of f(x) evaluated at x = 1. Let me compute f'(x). The function f(x) is x - 2 ln x, so its derivative f'(x) is the derivative of x minus the derivative of 2 ln x. The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of 2 ln x is 2*(1/x) = 2/x. So, f'(x) = 1 - 2/x.Now, evaluating this derivative at x = 1: f'(1) = 1 - 2/1 = 1 - 2 = -1. So, the slope of the tangent line at point A is -1.With the slope and the point known, I can write the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point. Substituting the values, we get y - 1 = -1*(x - 1). Simplifying this, y - 1 = -x + 1, so y = -x + 2. Alternatively, rearranging terms, we can write it as x + y - 2 = 0. That should be the equation of the tangent line.Moving on to part (II), which asks me to discuss the monotonic intervals of the function f(x). Monotonic intervals refer to where the function is increasing or decreasing. To determine this, I need to look at the derivative of f(x). The function is f(x) = x - a ln x, so its derivative f'(x) is 1 - a/x.To find where the function is increasing or decreasing, I need to analyze the sign of f'(x). If f'(x) > 0, the function is increasing; if f'(x) < 0, the function is decreasing.Let me write f'(x) as (x - a)/x. Since x > 0 (because ln x is only defined for x > 0), the denominator x is always positive. Therefore, the sign of f'(x) depends on the numerator, which is x - a.So, f'(x) = 0 when x - a = 0, which is at x = a. This critical point divides the domain into intervals. Let's consider different cases for a.Case 1: a ≤ 0. If a is less than or equal to zero, then x - a is always positive because x > 0 and a is non-positive. Therefore, f'(x) = (x - a)/x is always positive. This means that the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on its entire domain (0, ∞).Case 2: a > 0. In this case, the critical point x = a is within the domain (0, ∞). So, we need to analyze the intervals (0, a) and (a, ∞).For x in (0, a): x - a is negative because x < a. Therefore, f'(x) = (x - a)/x is negative. This means the function is decreasing on (0, a).For x in (a, ∞): x - a is positive because x > a. Therefore, f'(x) = (x - a)/x is positive. This means the function is increasing on (a, ∞).So, summarizing, when a > 0, f(x) is decreasing on (0, a) and increasing on (a, ∞). When a ≤ 0, f(x) is always increasing on (0, ∞).Wait, let me double-check. If a is negative, say a = -1, then f'(x) = 1 - (-1)/x = 1 + 1/x, which is always positive since both 1 and 1/x are positive for x > 0. So, yes, for a ≤ 0, f'(x) is always positive, meaning f(x) is increasing everywhere.If a is positive, say a = 3, then f'(x) = 1 - 3/x. Setting this equal to zero gives x = 3. So, for x < 3, f'(x) is negative, and for x > 3, f'(x) is positive. Therefore, the function decreases until x = 3 and then increases after that. That makes sense.I think I have covered all the cases. So, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, ∞) when a ≤ 0, and it has a decreasing interval (0, a) and an increasing interval (a, ∞) when a > 0.Wait, just to make sure, let me test with a specific value. Let’s take a = 2, as in part (I). Then f'(x) = 1 - 2/x. At x = 1, f'(1) = -1, which is negative, so the function is decreasing there. At x = 3, f'(3) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3, which is positive, so the function is increasing there. So, yes, the critical point is at x = 2, and the function decreases before that and increases after that.Another test: a = 0. Then f(x) = x - 0*ln x = x. Its derivative is 1, which is always positive. So, it's increasing everywhere, which aligns with our conclusion for a ≤ 0.What if a is negative, say a = -2? Then f'(x) = 1 - (-2)/x = 1 + 2/x, which is always positive since both terms are positive. So, the function is increasing everywhere, as expected.Okay, I think I have a solid understanding now. So, to recap:(I) When a = 2, the tangent line at (1, 1) has a slope of -1, so the equation is x + y - 2 = 0.(II) The function f(x) is increasing on (0, ∞) if a ≤ 0. If a > 0, it decreases on (0, a) and increases on (a, ∞).I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think I'm ready to present the final answers.**Final Answer**(I) The equation of the tangent line is boxed{x + y - 2 = 0}.(II) The function ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on ( (0, +infty) ) when ( a leq 0 ), and it is decreasing on ( (0, a) ) and increasing on ( (a, +infty) ) when ( a > 0 ).end{think>**Final Answer**(I) The equation of the tangent line is boxed{x + y - 2 = 0}.(II) The function ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on ( (0, +infty) ) when ( a leq 0 ), and it is decreasing on ( (0, a) ) and increasing on ( (a, +infty) ) when ( a > 0 )."},{"question":"How many non-congruent right triangles are there such that the perimeter in text{cm} is numerically equal to twice the length of the hypotenuse in text{cm}? textbf{(A)}  text{none} qquad  textbf{(B)}  1 qquad  textbf{(C)}  2 qquad  textbf{(D)}  4 qquad  textbf{(E)}  text{infinitely many}textbf{(A)}  text{none} qquad  textbf{(B)}  1 qquad  textbf{(C)}  2 qquad  textbf{(D)}  4 qquad  textbf{(E)}  text{infinitely many}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about right triangles. It says: \\"How many non-congruent right triangles are there such that the perimeter in centimeters is numerically equal to twice the length of the hypotenuse in centimeters?\\" The options are from A to E, with A being none, B being 1, and so on up to E being infinitely many.Alright, let me try to unpack this. First, it's about right triangles, so we're dealing with triangles where one angle is 90 degrees. The perimeter is the sum of all three sides, and the hypotenuse is the longest side opposite the right angle. The condition given is that the perimeter (in cm) is equal to twice the hypotenuse (also in cm). So, numerically, they're equal. That means if the perimeter is, say, 10 cm, then the hypotenuse would be 5 cm.Let me denote the sides of the right triangle. Let's call the two legs 'a' and 'b', and the hypotenuse 'c'. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:a² + b² = c²The perimeter is a + b + c. According to the problem, this perimeter is equal to twice the hypotenuse, so:a + b + c = 2cHmm, okay. Let me write that down:a + b + c = 2cIf I subtract c from both sides, I get:a + b = cWait, so the sum of the two legs is equal to the hypotenuse? That seems interesting. But in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always longer than either of the legs, right? So, if a and b are positive lengths, their sum should be greater than the hypotenuse, not equal. Is that correct?Let me think. In any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, in a right triangle, a + b > c, because c is the hypotenuse. So, if a + b = c, that would violate the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Therefore, such a triangle cannot exist.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me go back to the equation:a + b + c = 2cSubtract c from both sides:a + b = cSo, according to this, the sum of the two legs equals the hypotenuse. But as I thought earlier, in a triangle, the sum of two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if a + b = c, that would mean that the triangle is degenerate, meaning it collapses into a straight line, which isn't a valid triangle.Therefore, there are no such right triangles where the perimeter is equal to twice the hypotenuse because it would violate the triangle inequality.But wait, let me double-check my reasoning. Maybe I can approach this algebraically to see if there's a solution.Given that a + b + c = 2c, so a + b = c.But from Pythagoras, we have a² + b² = c².So, substituting c = a + b into the Pythagorean theorem:a² + b² = (a + b)²Expanding the right side:a² + b² = a² + 2ab + b²Subtracting a² + b² from both sides:0 = 2abWhich implies that ab = 0But in a triangle, both a and b must be positive lengths, so ab cannot be zero. Therefore, there are no solutions where a and b are positive real numbers.This confirms my earlier conclusion that such triangles cannot exist because it would require one of the sides to be zero, which isn't possible in a valid triangle.So, putting it all together, there are no non-congruent right triangles that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the answer should be A) none.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given the inequality in terms of x, 2x + a < 3, the sum of all positive integer solutions for x is 6. Find the range of values for a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: 2x + a < 3. I need to find the range of values for 'a' such that the sum of all positive integer solutions for x is 6. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I should probably solve the inequality for x to see what values x can take. So, starting with 2x + a < 3, I can subtract 'a' from both sides to get 2x < 3 - a. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get x < (3 - a)/2. So, x has to be less than (3 - a)/2.Now, the problem mentions positive integer solutions for x. That means x can be 1, 2, 3, etc., but it has to be less than (3 - a)/2. So, the positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 up to the largest integer less than (3 - a)/2.The sum of these positive integers is given as 6. I need to figure out which set of positive integers adds up to 6. Let me list the possible sets:- If x can be 1, 2, 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. That's exactly 6.- If x can be just 1 and 2: 1 + 2 = 3, which is too small.- If x can be 1, 2, 3, 4: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, which is too big.So, the only set that sums to 6 is {1, 2, 3}. That means x can be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the largest integer x can be is 3, which means that (3 - a)/2 must be greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4. Wait, why?Let me explain. If x has to be less than (3 - a)/2, and the largest integer x is 3, then (3 - a)/2 must be greater than 3 because if it were equal to 3, x would have to be less than 3, meaning x could only be 1 and 2, which sums to 3, not 6. So, (3 - a)/2 must be greater than 3.But it also can't be too large because if (3 - a)/2 is greater than 4, then x could be 1, 2, 3, 4, which sums to 10, which is more than 6. So, (3 - a)/2 must be greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4.So, mathematically, that translates to:3 < (3 - a)/2 ≤ 4Now, I need to solve this inequality for 'a'. Let me do that step by step.First, multiply all parts of the inequality by 2 to eliminate the denominator:3 * 2 < (3 - a) ≤ 4 * 2Which simplifies to:6 < 3 - a ≤ 8Now, I need to solve for 'a'. Let's subtract 3 from all parts:6 - 3 < -a ≤ 8 - 3Which simplifies to:3 < -a ≤ 5Now, I can multiply all parts by -1, but I have to remember that multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality signs. So:-3 > a ≥ -5Which is the same as:-5 ≤ a < -3So, the range of values for 'a' is from -5 up to, but not including, -3.Let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.If a is -5, then the inequality becomes 2x - 5 < 3. Adding 5 to both sides gives 2x < 8, so x < 4. The positive integers less than 4 are 1, 2, 3, which sum to 6. That works.If a is -3, then the inequality becomes 2x - 3 < 3. Adding 3 to both sides gives 2x < 6, so x < 3. The positive integers less than 3 are 1 and 2, which sum to 3, not 6. So, a can't be -3.If a is between -5 and -3, say a = -4, then the inequality is 2x - 4 < 3. Adding 4 gives 2x < 7, so x < 3.5. The positive integers less than 3.5 are 1, 2, 3, which sum to 6. That works.If a is just above -5, like a = -5.1, then 2x - 5.1 < 3. Adding 5.1 gives 2x < 8.1, so x < 4.05. The positive integers less than 4.05 are 1, 2, 3, 4, which sum to 10, which is too much. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, no. If a is less than -5, say a = -6, then 2x - 6 < 3. Adding 6 gives 2x < 9, so x < 4.5. The positive integers less than 4.5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, which sum to 10. But according to my earlier solution, a should be greater than or equal to -5. So, if a is less than -5, the sum becomes larger than 6. Therefore, a must be at least -5.Similarly, if a is greater than -3, say a = -2, then 2x - 2 < 3. Adding 2 gives 2x < 5, so x < 2.5. The positive integers less than 2.5 are 1 and 2, which sum to 3, which is too small. So, a must be less than -3.Therefore, my initial conclusion seems correct: -5 ≤ a < -3.I think that's the correct range for 'a'. Let me just recap:1. Solve the inequality for x: x < (3 - a)/2.2. Determine that the positive integers x must be 1, 2, 3 to sum to 6.3. Set up the inequality 3 < (3 - a)/2 ≤ 4.4. Solve for 'a' to get -5 ≤ a < -3.5. Verify with test values to ensure correctness.Yes, everything checks out. So, the range of 'a' is from -5 to -3, including -5 but not including -3.**Final Answer**The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{[-5, -3)}.**Final Answer**The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{[-5, -3)}."},{"question":"The equation frac {x^{2}}{4-t} + frac {y^{2}}{t-1} = 1 represents the curve C.

It's called curve C. There are four propositions about this curve, and I need to figure out how many of them are correct. The options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. Let me go through each proposition one by one.First, let me recall the standard forms of conic sections. An ellipse is usually written as (x²)/a² + (y²)/b² = 1, where a and b are positive real numbers. A hyperbola is similar but with a minus sign: (x²)/a² - (y²)/b² = 1 or vice versa. A circle is a special case of an ellipse where a = b.So, looking at the given equation, the denominators are (4 - t) and (t - 1). For it to be an ellipse, both denominators need to be positive because in an ellipse, both terms are positive. So, 4 - t > 0 and t - 1 > 0. That means t < 4 and t > 1. So, combining these, t must be between 1 and 4. That seems to match proposition ①: If curve C is an ellipse, then 1 < t < 4. So, ① seems correct.Next, proposition ②: If curve C is a hyperbola, then t < 1 or t > 4. For a hyperbola, one term is positive and the other is negative. So, either (4 - t) > 0 and (t - 1) < 0, or (4 - t) < 0 and (t - 1) > 0. Let's see:Case 1: (4 - t) > 0 and (t - 1) < 0. That would mean t < 4 and t < 1. So, t < 1.Case 2: (4 - t) < 0 and (t - 1) > 0. That would mean t > 4 and t > 1. So, t > 4.Therefore, for the equation to represent a hyperbola, t must be less than 1 or greater than 4. So, proposition ② is correct.Proposition ③: Curve C cannot be a circle. Hmm, a circle requires both denominators to be equal. So, 4 - t = t - 1. Let me solve for t:4 - t = t - 1  4 + 1 = t + t  5 = 2t  t = 5/2.So, when t = 5/2, the equation becomes (x²)/(4 - 5/2) + (y²)/(5/2 - 1) = 1. Calculating the denominators:4 - 5/2 = 3/2  5/2 - 1 = 3/2.So, the equation is (x²)/(3/2) + (y²)/(3/2) = 1, which simplifies to (x² + y²)/(3/2) = 1, or x² + y² = 3/2. That's a circle with radius sqrt(3/2). So, actually, curve C can be a circle when t = 5/2. Therefore, proposition ③ is incorrect.Proposition ④: If curve C represents an ellipse with foci on the X-axis, then 1 < t < 5/2. For an ellipse, the foci are on the major axis. If the foci are on the X-axis, that means the major axis is along the X-axis, so the denominator under x² must be larger than the denominator under y². So, 4 - t > t - 1.Let me solve that inequality:4 - t > t - 1  4 + 1 > t + t  5 > 2t  t < 5/2.But we also know from proposition ① that for it to be an ellipse, t must be between 1 and 4. So, combining these, t must be between 1 and 5/2. Therefore, proposition ④ is correct.So, summarizing:① Correct  ② Correct  ③ Incorrect  ④ CorrectWait, that's three correct propositions. But the options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. So, the answer should be C:3. But hold on, let me double-check.Wait, proposition ③: Curve C cannot be a circle. But I found that when t = 5/2, it becomes a circle. So, ③ is incorrect. So, only ①, ②, and ④ are correct. That's three correct propositions. So, the answer is C:3.But wait, the initial thought process in the problem statement said that ① and ③ are incorrect because when t = 5/2, it's a circle. But according to my analysis, ① is correct because for an ellipse, t must be between 1 and 4, regardless of whether it's a circle or not. So, ① is correct because it's a necessary condition for being an ellipse, even though it can sometimes be a circle.Wait, so ① says \\"If curve C is an ellipse, then 1 < t < 4.\\" That's correct because for it to be an ellipse, both denominators must be positive, which requires t between 1 and 4. The fact that it can also be a circle doesn't make ① incorrect. So, ① is correct.Similarly, ③ is incorrect because it can be a circle. So, ①, ②, and ④ are correct, making three correct propositions. So, the answer is C:3.But wait, in the initial problem statement, the assistant concluded that ① and ③ are incorrect, but that seems wrong because ① is correct. So, maybe the assistant made a mistake. Let me check again.Proposition ①: If curve C is an ellipse, then 1 < t < 4. Yes, because for an ellipse, both denominators must be positive, so t must be between 1 and 4. So, ① is correct.Proposition ②: If curve C is a hyperbola, then t < 1 or t > 4. Correct, as we saw.Proposition ③: Curve C cannot be a circle. Incorrect, because when t = 5/2, it's a circle.Proposition ④: If curve C represents an ellipse with foci on the X-axis, then 1 < t < 5/2. Correct, because for foci on X-axis, 4 - t > t - 1, leading to t < 5/2, and since it's an ellipse, t >1.So, three correct propositions: ①, ②, ④. So, the answer is C:3.But wait, in the initial problem statement, the assistant concluded that ① and ③ are incorrect, which is wrong. So, the correct answer is C:3."},{"question":"A glass was filled with some ounces of water, and 0.06 ounce of the water evaporated each day during a 20-day period. 12% of the original amount of water evaporated during this period.

Since 0.06 ounces evaporate each day, multiplying this by 20 gives the total evaporation.Next, I know that this total evaporation represents 12% of the original amount of water in the glass.

The options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. Let me go through each statement one by one and see if I can determine their correctness.Starting with statement (1): \\"The axis of symmetry of an isosceles triangle is the perpendicular bisector of the base.\\" Hmm, okay. I remember that an isosceles triangle has two equal sides and a base. The axis of symmetry should be the line that divides the triangle into two mirror images. In an isosceles triangle, this line is also the altitude, median, and angle bisector from the apex to the base. So, does this line also act as the perpendicular bisector of the base? Well, yes, because it splits the base into two equal parts at a right angle. So, I think statement (1) is correct.Moving on to statement (2): \\"The diagonals of a rhombus are equal and bisect each other.\\" Okay, a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal. I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but are they equal? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal. In fact, only in a square, which is a special type of rhombus, are the diagonals equal. So, in a general rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other. So, since the statement claims they are equal, that part is incorrect. Therefore, statement (2) is incorrect.Next, statement (3): \\"A quadrilateral whose four interior angles are all equal is a rectangle.\\" Let's see. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. If all four angles are equal, then each angle must be 360 divided by 4, which is 90 degrees. So, each angle is a right angle. A quadrilateral with four right angles is a rectangle. So, yes, statement (3) is correct.Statement (4): \\"The quadrilateral formed by sequentially connecting the midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral with equal diagonals is a rhombus.\\" Hmm, okay. So, if you take any quadrilateral and connect the midpoints of its sides, you form a new quadrilateral. I remember that this new quadrilateral is always a parallelogram, regardless of the original quadrilateral. But in this case, the original quadrilateral has equal diagonals. So, does that make the new quadrilateral a rhombus? Let me think. If the original quadrilateral has equal diagonals, then the midpoints' quadrilateral, which is a parallelogram, would have sides equal to half the length of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are equal, the sides of the new quadrilateral would also be equal, making it a rhombus. So, yes, statement (4) is correct.Finally, statement (5): \\"A quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular and equal is a square.\\" Okay, so if a quadrilateral has diagonals that are both perpendicular and equal, is it necessarily a square? Well, I know that in a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. But are there other quadrilaterals that have this property? For example, a rectangle has equal diagonals but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. A rhombus has perpendicular diagonals but they are not equal unless it's a square. So, if a quadrilateral has both equal and perpendicular diagonals, it must be a square. Wait, is that true? Let me think again. If a quadrilateral has equal diagonals and they are perpendicular, does that force all sides to be equal and all angles to be right angles? I think yes, because the combination of equal and perpendicular diagonals imposes that the sides must be equal and the angles must be right angles. So, statement (5) is correct.Wait, hold on. Did I make a mistake with statement (5)? Because earlier, I thought that if diagonals are equal and perpendicular, it's a square, but actually, is that the case? Let me visualize. If I have a quadrilateral with equal diagonals that are perpendicular, does that necessarily make it a square? Or could it be another shape? Hmm, I think it's a square because in a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. In other quadrilaterals, like a rectangle or a rhombus, the diagonals are either equal or perpendicular, but not both unless it's a square. So, yes, statement (5) is correct.Wait, no, hold on again. I'm confusing myself. Let me recall: In a square, diagonals are equal and perpendicular. In a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular but not equal. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal but not perpendicular. So, if a quadrilateral has both equal and perpendicular diagonals, it must be a square. So, statement (5) is correct.But wait, actually, I think I might be wrong here. Because there's a theorem that says if a quadrilateral has equal and perpendicular diagonals, it's a square. But is that always true? Let me think of a kite. A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides equal. Its diagonals are perpendicular, but they are not equal. So, a kite is not a square. But if a kite has equal diagonals, then it must be a square. So, if a quadrilateral has equal and perpendicular diagonals, it's a square. Therefore, statement (5) is correct.Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to verify. If a quadrilateral has both equal and perpendicular diagonals, does that make it a square? Let's consider a quadrilateral with diagonals of length, say, 2 units each, intersecting at 90 degrees. What shape would that be? It would have four sides, each side being the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 1 unit each (since the diagonals are bisected). So, each side would be sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So, all sides are equal, and all angles would be right angles because the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. Therefore, it must be a square. So, statement (5) is correct.Wait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think of another example. Suppose I have a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and perpendicular, but the sides are not all equal. Is that possible? If the diagonals are equal and perpendicular, then the sides must be equal because each side is determined by the segments of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are equal and intersect at 90 degrees, each side would be equal. Therefore, the quadrilateral must be a square. So, statement (5) is correct.Okay, so after going through each statement:1. Correct2. Incorrect3. Correct4. Correct5. CorrectWait, that would mean four correct statements, which is option D. But earlier, I thought statement (5) might be incorrect, but after careful consideration, I think it's correct. So, four correct statements. Hmm, but let me double-check statement (4). It says: \\"The quadrilateral formed by sequentially connecting the midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral with equal diagonals is a rhombus.\\" So, the original quadrilateral has equal diagonals. Connecting midpoints forms a parallelogram, and if the original diagonals are equal, then the sides of the new parallelogram are equal, making it a rhombus. Yes, that's correct.So, statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. That's four correct statements. So, the answer should be D:4.Wait, but in the initial problem, the options were A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4. So, the correct answer is D:4.But hold on, I think I made a mistake with statement (5). Let me check again. If a quadrilateral has equal and perpendicular diagonals, is it necessarily a square? Or could it be another shape? Let me think of a convex quadrilateral with equal and perpendicular diagonals. It must be a square because the only quadrilateral with equal and perpendicular diagonals is a square. In a square, diagonals are equal and perpendicular. In other quadrilaterals, like a rectangle or rhombus, diagonals are either equal or perpendicular, but not both. So, yes, statement (5) is correct.Therefore, all statements except statement (2) are correct. So, four correct statements. So, the answer is D:4."},{"question":"The first square is in position ABCD. After rotating the square 180 degrees about its center point, the second square is in position DCBA. Next, square DCBA is reflected over its horizontal line of symmetry, resulting in the third square in position ABCD. If the pattern of alternately rotating 180 degrees and reflecting over the horizontal line of symmetry continues, in what position will the 2007th square be? Write your answer starting with the lower left vertex and continuing clockwise.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a square that's being transformed in a certain pattern, and I need to figure out where it'll be after the 2007th transformation. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the square starts in position ABCD. I assume ABCD means the vertices are labeled clockwise, starting from the lower left. So, if I imagine the square, A is the lower left, B is the lower right, C is the upper right, and D is the upper left. That makes sense.Then, the first transformation is a 180-degree rotation about the center point. I know that rotating a square 180 degrees will flip it so that each vertex goes to the position diagonally opposite. So, point A (lower left) would move to where C was (upper right), and point C would move to A. Similarly, B (lower right) would move to D (upper left), and D would move to B. So, after this rotation, the square's vertices would be in the order DCBA. Let me write that down:1st transformation (rotation): ABCD → DCBAOkay, next, the second transformation is a reflection over the horizontal line of symmetry. The horizontal line of symmetry in a square would be the line that cuts it horizontally through the middle, right? So reflecting over this line would flip the square vertically. Let me think about what that does to the vertices.If the square is in position DCBA, reflecting over the horizontal axis would flip the top and bottom. So, point D (upper left) would move to where B was (lower right), and point B would move to D. Similarly, point C (upper right) would move to A (lower left), and point A would move to C. Wait, hold on, that might not be right. Let me visualize this.If the square is DCBA, with D at the upper left, C at the upper right, B at the lower right, and A at the lower left. Reflecting over the horizontal axis would swap the upper and lower vertices. So, D would go to B, and B would go to D. Similarly, C would go to A, and A would go to C. So, after reflection, the order would be ABCD again.2nd transformation (reflection): DCBA → ABCDSo, after two transformations, we're back to the original position ABCD. That suggests that the transformations cycle every two steps: rotation, reflection, rotation, reflection, and so on.So, the pattern is:1. ABCD (original)2. DCBA (after rotation)3. ABCD (after reflection)4. DCBA (after rotation)5. ABCD (after reflection)6. DCBA (after rotation)7. ABCD (after reflection)... and so on.So, it alternates between ABCD and DCBA with each transformation. That means that every even-numbered transformation brings it back to ABCD, and every odd-numbered transformation (after the first) brings it to DCBA.Wait, let me check that. Starting from ABCD:1. Rotation: DCBA (1st transformation, odd)2. Reflection: ABCD (2nd transformation, even)3. Rotation: DCBA (3rd transformation, odd)4. Reflection: ABCD (4th transformation, even)5. Rotation: DCBA (5th transformation, odd)6. Reflection: ABCD (6th transformation, even)... etc.So, yes, it seems that odd-numbered transformations result in DCBA, and even-numbered ones bring it back to ABCD.Now, the question is asking for the position after the 2007th transformation. Since 2007 is an odd number, following the pattern, it should be in position DCBA.But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the sequence again.Starting at step 0: ABCDStep 1: DCBA (rotation)Step 2: ABCD (reflection)Step 3: DCBA (rotation)Step 4: ABCD (reflection)...So, step n: if n is odd, DCBA; if n is even, ABCD.Since 2007 is odd, it should be DCBA.But wait, let me think about the transformations again. Each transformation is either a rotation or a reflection, alternating each time. So, the first transformation is a rotation, the second is a reflection, the third is a rotation, and so on.So, for each pair of transformations (rotation followed by reflection), it brings the square back to its original position. So, every two transformations, it cycles back.Therefore, the cycle length is 2. So, to find the position after 2007 transformations, we can see how many complete cycles of 2 are in 2007, and then see what the remainder is.2007 divided by 2 is 1003 with a remainder of 1. So, 1003 complete cycles (each bringing it back to ABCD) and then one more transformation.Since each cycle ends at ABCD, after 1003 cycles (2006 transformations), it's back to ABCD. Then, the 2007th transformation is a rotation (since the first transformation is rotation, the third is rotation, etc., so odd-numbered transformations are rotations).So, rotating ABCD 180 degrees gives DCBA.Therefore, the 2007th transformation results in DCBA.I think that's consistent with my earlier conclusion. So, the position after the 2007th transformation is DCBA.Just to double-check, let's consider smaller numbers:- After 1 transformation: DCBA (correct)- After 2 transformations: ABCD (correct)- After 3 transformations: DCBA (correct)- After 4 transformations: ABCD (correct)- After 5 transformations: DCBA (correct)- After 6 transformations: ABCD (correct)Yes, the pattern holds. So, for any odd number, it's DCBA, and for any even number, it's ABCD.Therefore, the 2007th transformation, being odd, results in DCBA."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=ln x-x^{2}+ax.(1) If f(1)=0, find the monotonically decreasing interval of the function f(x);(2) Prove that when ngeqslant 2(n∈N^{}), frac{1}{ln 2}+frac{1}{ln 3}+frac{1}{ln 4}+... +frac{1}{ln n} > 1;(3) If the inequality f(x)leqslant left( frac{1}{2}a-1 right){{x}^{2}}+(2a-1)x-1 always holds, find the minimum value of the integer a.","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = ln x - x² + a x, and there are three parts to the problem. Let me try to tackle each part step by step.Starting with part (1): If f(1) = 0, find the monotonically decreasing interval of the function f(x). Okay, so first, I need to find the value of 'a' that satisfies f(1) = 0. Let's plug x = 1 into the function:f(1) = ln(1) - (1)² + a*(1) = 0 - 1 + a = a - 1.Since f(1) = 0, we have a - 1 = 0, so a = 1. Got that. So now, the function becomes f(x) = ln x - x² + x.Next, I need to find the intervals where this function is monotonically decreasing. To do that, I should find the derivative of f(x) and determine where it's negative.f'(x) = derivative of ln x is 1/x, derivative of -x² is -2x, and derivative of x is 1. So,f'(x) = (1/x) - 2x + 1.I can write this as a single fraction to make it easier to analyze:f'(x) = (1 - 2x² + x) / x.So, f'(x) = (-2x² + x + 1) / x.Now, to find where f'(x) < 0, which would mean the function is decreasing. Since x > 0 (because ln x is only defined for x > 0), the denominator x is positive. So, the sign of f'(x) depends on the numerator: -2x² + x + 1.Let me set the numerator equal to zero to find critical points:-2x² + x + 1 = 0.Multiplying both sides by -1 to make it easier:2x² - x - 1 = 0.Using the quadratic formula, x = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / (2*2) = [1 ± 3] / 4.So, x = (1 + 3)/4 = 1 or x = (1 - 3)/4 = -0.5.Since x must be positive, we discard the negative root. So, the critical point is at x = 1.Now, let's analyze the sign of the numerator:-2x² + x + 1.For x < 1, let's pick x = 0.5:-2*(0.25) + 0.5 + 1 = -0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 1 > 0.So, numerator is positive when x < 1.For x > 1, let's pick x = 2:-2*(4) + 2 + 1 = -8 + 2 + 1 = -5 < 0.So, numerator is negative when x > 1.Therefore, f'(x) is positive when x < 1 and negative when x > 1. Hence, the function is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, ∞).So, the monotonically decreasing interval is (1, ∞).Moving on to part (2): Prove that when n ≥ 2 (n is a natural number), 1/ln 2 + 1/ln 3 + 1/ln 4 + ... + 1/ln n > 1.Hmm, okay, so I need to show that the sum of reciprocals of ln k from k=2 to n is greater than 1 for n ≥ 2.I remember that in part (1), we found that f(x) = ln x - x² + x is decreasing for x > 1. Maybe we can use that result here.Given that f(x) is decreasing for x > 1, and f(1) = 0, then for x > 1, f(x) ≤ f(1) = 0. So,ln x - x² + x ≤ 0Which implies,ln x ≤ x² - x.So, for x > 1, ln x ≤ x² - x.Therefore, 1/ln x ≥ 1/(x² - x).But wait, x² - x = x(x - 1), so 1/(x² - x) = 1/(x(x - 1)).So, 1/ln x ≥ 1/(x(x - 1)).But I need to be careful here. Since ln x is positive for x > 1, and x² - x is positive for x > 1, the inequality direction remains the same when taking reciprocals.So, 1/ln x ≥ 1/(x(x - 1)).Now, let's sum both sides from x = 2 to x = n.Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k ≥ Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k(k - 1)).The right-hand side is a telescoping series:Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k(k - 1)) = Sum_{k=2}^n [1/(k - 1) - 1/k] = (1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + ... + (1/(n-1) - 1/n) = 1 - 1/n.So, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k ≥ 1 - 1/n.Since n ≥ 2, 1 - 1/n ≥ 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. But we need to show that the sum is greater than 1.Wait, that doesn't seem to add up. Because 1 - 1/n is less than 1, but we need to show the sum is greater than 1.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality.Wait, let's go back. We have ln x ≤ x² - x for x > 1.So, 1/ln x ≥ 1/(x² - x) = 1/(x(x - 1)).But when we sum 1/(x(x - 1)) from x=2 to n, we get 1 - 1/n.So, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k ≥ 1 - 1/n.But 1 - 1/n is less than 1, so how does this help us?Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln x ≤ x - 1 for x ≥ 1, which is a standard inequality. But that might not directly help here.Wait, in part (1), we have f(x) = ln x - x² + x ≤ 0 for x ≥ 1, so ln x ≤ x² - x.But x² - x = x(x - 1). So, 1/ln x ≥ 1/(x(x - 1)).So, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k ≥ Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k(k - 1)) = 1 - 1/n.But 1 - 1/n is less than 1, so how do we get the sum to be greater than 1?Wait, maybe I need to consider that 1/ln k > 1/(k(k - 1)) for k ≥ 2.But 1/(k(k - 1)) = 1/(k - 1) - 1/k.So, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k > Sum_{k=2}^n [1/(k - 1) - 1/k] = 1 - 1/n.But 1 - 1/n is less than 1, so this approach only shows that the sum is greater than 1 - 1/n, which is less than 1.Hmm, maybe I need a different inequality.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln k < k - 1 for k ≥ 2, but that would give 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1), but that also doesn't directly help.Wait, let's think differently. Maybe instead of using the inequality from part (1), I can use another approach.Consider the function f(x) = ln x - x² + x. We know it's decreasing for x > 1, and f(1) = 0. So, for x > 1, f(x) < 0, which means ln x < x² - x.So, 1/ln x > 1/(x² - x) = 1/(x(x - 1)).But as before, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k > Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k(k - 1)) = 1 - 1/n.But 1 - 1/n < 1, so this doesn't help.Wait, maybe I need to consider that 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1) for k ≥ 2.Is that true? Let's check for k=2: 1/ln 2 ≈ 1.4427, and 1/(2 - 1) = 1. So, 1.4427 > 1, which is true.For k=3: 1/ln 3 ≈ 0.9102, and 1/(3 - 1) = 0.5. So, 0.9102 > 0.5, which is true.Similarly, for k=4: 1/ln 4 ≈ 0.7213, and 1/(4 - 1) ≈ 0.3333. So, 0.7213 > 0.3333.So, in general, for k ≥ 2, 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1).Therefore, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k > Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k - 1) = Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m.But Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m is the harmonic series up to n-1, which is known to be greater than ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (~0.5772).But for n ≥ 2, Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m ≥ 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 > 1.Wait, but that seems too strong. Wait, for n=2, Sum_{k=2}^2 1/ln 2 ≈ 1.4427 > 1, which is true.For n=3, Sum ≈ 1.4427 + 0.9102 ≈ 2.3529 > 1.So, in general, the sum is greater than 1 for n ≥ 2.But wait, the problem asks to prove that the sum is greater than 1, not necessarily how much greater. So, using the fact that 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1) for k ≥ 2, and Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k - 1) = Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m ≥ 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 > 1 for n ≥ 2.But actually, for n=2, Sum_{k=2}^2 1/ln 2 ≈ 1.4427 > 1, which is true.So, that works. Therefore, the sum is greater than 1 for n ≥ 2.Alternatively, another approach is to note that for k ≥ 2, ln k < k - 1, so 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1). Therefore, Sum_{k=2}^n 1/ln k > Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k - 1) = Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m.But the harmonic series Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m is known to be greater than ln(n) for n ≥ 1. Since ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, but for n=2, Sum_{m=1}^{1} 1/m = 1 > 1, which is not helpful. Wait, no, for n=2, Sum_{k=2}^2 1/ln 2 ≈ 1.4427 > 1.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that for each k ≥ 2, 1/ln k > 1/(k - 1), and Sum_{k=2}^n 1/(k - 1) = Sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 1/m, which for n ≥ 2, is at least 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 > 1.Therefore, the sum is greater than 1.Okay, that seems to work.Now, part (3): If the inequality f(x) ≤ (1/2 a - 1)x² + (2a - 1)x - 1 always holds, find the minimum value of the integer a.So, we have f(x) = ln x - x² + a x ≤ (1/2 a - 1)x² + (2a - 1)x - 1 for all x > 0.Let me rewrite the inequality:ln x - x² + a x ≤ ( (1/2)a - 1 )x² + (2a - 1)x - 1.Let me bring all terms to one side:ln x - x² + a x - [ ( (1/2)a - 1 )x² + (2a - 1)x - 1 ] ≤ 0.Simplify term by term:ln x - x² + a x - (1/2 a - 1)x² - (2a - 1)x + 1 ≤ 0.Let me distribute the negative sign:ln x - x² + a x - (1/2 a)x² + x² - (2a)x + x + 1 ≤ 0.Now, combine like terms:- x² + x² = 0.- (1/2 a)x².a x - 2a x + x = (a - 2a + 1)x = (-a + 1)x.So, putting it all together:ln x - (1/2 a)x² + (-a + 1)x + 1 ≤ 0.So, the inequality becomes:ln x - (1/2 a)x² + (1 - a)x + 1 ≤ 0 for all x > 0.Let me denote this as:g(x) = ln x - (1/2 a)x² + (1 - a)x + 1 ≤ 0 for all x > 0.We need to find the minimum integer a such that g(x) ≤ 0 for all x > 0.To ensure that g(x) ≤ 0 for all x > 0, we need to find the maximum value of g(x) and ensure that it is ≤ 0.So, first, let's find the critical points of g(x). Compute g'(x):g'(x) = derivative of ln x is 1/x, derivative of - (1/2 a)x² is -a x, derivative of (1 - a)x is (1 - a), and derivative of 1 is 0.So,g'(x) = 1/x - a x + (1 - a).Set g'(x) = 0 to find critical points:1/x - a x + (1 - a) = 0.Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:1 - a x² + (1 - a)x = 0.Rearranged:- a x² + (1 - a)x + 1 = 0.Multiply both sides by -1:a x² + (a - 1)x - 1 = 0.So, quadratic equation: a x² + (a - 1)x - 1 = 0.Let me solve for x:x = [ -(a - 1) ± sqrt( (a - 1)^2 + 4a ) ] / (2a).Simplify the discriminant:D = (a - 1)^2 + 4a = a² - 2a + 1 + 4a = a² + 2a + 1 = (a + 1)^2.So, sqrt(D) = a + 1.Thus,x = [ -(a - 1) ± (a + 1) ] / (2a).Let's consider the two roots:First root with '+':x = [ -(a - 1) + (a + 1) ] / (2a) = [ -a + 1 + a + 1 ] / (2a) = (2) / (2a) = 1/a.Second root with '-':x = [ -(a - 1) - (a + 1) ] / (2a) = [ -a + 1 - a - 1 ] / (2a) = (-2a) / (2a) = -1.But x > 0, so we discard the negative root. Thus, the critical point is at x = 1/a.Now, we need to analyze the behavior of g(x) around this critical point.Since g(x) is defined for x > 0, and we have a critical point at x = 1/a, let's check the second derivative to determine if it's a maximum or minimum.Compute g''(x):g''(x) = derivative of g'(x) = derivative of (1/x - a x + (1 - a)) = -1/x² - a.So, g''(x) = -1/x² - a.At x = 1/a, g''(1/a) = -1/(1/a)² - a = -a² - a.Since a is an integer and we're looking for the minimum a, let's consider a ≥ 1.For a ≥ 1, g''(1/a) = -a² - a < 0, which means the critical point at x = 1/a is a local maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) occurs at x = 1/a, and we need to ensure that g(1/a) ≤ 0.So, let's compute g(1/a):g(1/a) = ln(1/a) - (1/2 a)(1/a)² + (1 - a)(1/a) + 1.Simplify each term:ln(1/a) = -ln a.(1/2 a)(1/a²) = (1/2 a)(1/a²) = 1/(2 a³).(1 - a)(1/a) = (1/a - 1).So,g(1/a) = -ln a - 1/(2 a³) + (1/a - 1) + 1.Simplify:- ln a - 1/(2 a³) + 1/a - 1 + 1.The -1 and +1 cancel out:g(1/a) = -ln a - 1/(2 a³) + 1/a.So, we have:g(1/a) = -ln a + 1/a - 1/(2 a³).We need this to be ≤ 0.So,-ln a + 1/a - 1/(2 a³) ≤ 0.Let me denote this as:h(a) = -ln a + 1/a - 1/(2 a³) ≤ 0.We need to find the smallest integer a such that h(a) ≤ 0.Let's compute h(a) for a = 1, 2, 3, etc., until we find the smallest a where h(a) ≤ 0.For a = 1:h(1) = -ln 1 + 1/1 - 1/(2*1³) = 0 + 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 > 0.Not good.For a = 2:h(2) = -ln 2 + 1/2 - 1/(2*8) = -0.6931 + 0.5 - 0.0625 ≈ -0.6931 + 0.4375 ≈ -0.2556 < 0.So, h(2) < 0.Wait, let me compute more accurately:ln 2 ≈ 0.69314718056.So,h(2) = -0.69314718056 + 0.5 - 1/(16) ≈ -0.69314718056 + 0.5 - 0.0625 ≈ (-0.69314718056 + 0.5) = -0.19314718056 - 0.0625 ≈ -0.25564718056 < 0.So, h(2) < 0.Therefore, a = 2 satisfies h(a) ≤ 0.But let's check a = 1 again:h(1) = -0 + 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 > 0.So, a = 1 does not satisfy.Therefore, the minimum integer a is 2.But wait, let me check a = 2 more carefully.We have g(1/a) = g(1/2) = -ln 2 + 1/2 - 1/(2*(8)) = -ln 2 + 0.5 - 0.0625 ≈ -0.6931 + 0.4375 ≈ -0.2556 < 0.So, the maximum of g(x) is negative, which means g(x) ≤ 0 for all x > 0.Therefore, a = 2 is sufficient.But just to be thorough, let's check a = 1 again. If a = 1, then the inequality becomes:ln x - x² + x ≤ ( (1/2)*1 - 1 )x² + (2*1 - 1)x - 1.Simplify:ln x - x² + x ≤ (-1/2)x² + x - 1.Bring all terms to left:ln x - x² + x + (1/2)x² - x + 1 ≤ 0.Simplify:ln x - (1/2)x² + 1 ≤ 0.So, ln x - (1/2)x² + 1 ≤ 0.Let me check x = 1:ln 1 - (1/2)(1) + 1 = 0 - 0.5 + 1 = 0.5 > 0.So, at x = 1, the left side is 0.5 > 0, which violates the inequality. Therefore, a = 1 is insufficient.Thus, the minimum integer a is 2."},{"question":"What is the smallest positive integer n such that frac{n}{n+70} is a terminating decimal?","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem: I need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that the fraction ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) is a terminating decimal. Hmm, terminating decimals... I remember that for a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and/or 5. So, that means ( n + 70 ) has to be a number whose only prime factors are 2 and 5.Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what makes a decimal terminate. From what I recall, a fraction ( frac{a}{b} ) will be a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator ( b ), after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. So, in this case, ( n + 70 ) must be such that when ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) is simplified, the denominator is only made up of 2s and 5s.But wait, ( n ) and ( n + 70 ) might have common factors. So, I should consider that ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) might simplify to a fraction where the denominator is a product of 2s and 5s. That means ( n + 70 ) must be a multiple of some power of 2 and/or 5, but it could also have other factors that cancel out with ( n ).Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the denominator ( n + 70 ). For ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) to be a terminating decimal, ( n + 70 ) must be of the form ( 2^k times 5^m ) where ( k ) and ( m ) are non-negative integers. That way, the denominator only has prime factors 2 and 5, which is what we need for a terminating decimal.So, my task is to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( n + 70 = 2^k times 5^m ). Since ( n ) has to be positive, ( n + 70 ) must be greater than 70. Therefore, I need to find the smallest number greater than 70 that is only composed of the primes 2 and 5.Let me list the numbers greater than 70 and check their prime factors:- 71: Prime number, not 2 or 5.- 72: Factors are 2^3 * 3^2. Oh, it has a 3, so no.- 73: Prime, not 2 or 5.- 74: 2 * 37. 37 is prime, so no.- 75: 3 * 5^2. Again, a 3, so no.- 76: 2^2 * 19. 19 is prime, so no.- 77: 7 * 11. Both primes, nope.- 78: 2 * 3 * 13. Multiple primes, no.- 79: Prime, no.- 80: 2^4 * 5. Okay, this looks promising! It's 16 * 5, so only 2s and 5s.Wait, 80 is 2^4 * 5, so that's good. So, if ( n + 70 = 80 ), then ( n = 80 - 70 = 10 ). Is 10 the smallest positive integer? Let me check if there's a smaller number between 70 and 80 that fits.Looking back, 72 had a factor of 3, 75 had a 3, 76 had 19, 78 had 3 and 13. So, the next number after 70 that is only 2s and 5s is 80. So, ( n = 10 ). But wait, let me verify this.If ( n = 10 ), then ( frac{10}{80} = frac{1}{8} ). And ( frac{1}{8} = 0.125 ), which is a terminating decimal. So, that works. But is 10 the smallest possible ( n )?Wait, hold on. Maybe there's a smaller ( n ) where ( n + 70 ) is a multiple of a higher power of 2 or 5, but still less than 80. Let me think.What about 75? ( n + 70 = 75 ) would mean ( n = 5 ). But 75 is 3 * 5^2, which includes a 3, so that's not allowed. Similarly, 72 is 2^3 * 3^2, which also includes a 3. So, those don't work.How about 80? That's the first one after 70 that only has 2s and 5s. So, ( n = 10 ) seems to be the answer. But wait, let me check if ( frac{10}{80} ) reduces to a simpler fraction. ( frac{10}{80} = frac{1}{8} ), which is indeed a terminating decimal.But hold on, maybe there's a smaller ( n ) where ( n + 70 ) is a multiple of a higher power of 2 or 5, but still results in a denominator with only 2s and 5s after simplifying. For example, if ( n + 70 ) is 100, which is 2^2 * 5^2, then ( n = 30 ). But 30 is larger than 10, so 10 is still smaller.Wait, but maybe if ( n ) shares a common factor with ( n + 70 ), then the simplified denominator could be smaller. For instance, suppose ( n = 14 ). Then ( n + 70 = 84 ). 84 factors into 2^2 * 3 * 7. So, ( frac{14}{84} = frac{1}{6} ), which is 0.1666..., a repeating decimal. So, that doesn't work.What about ( n = 20 )? Then ( n + 70 = 90 ). 90 factors into 2 * 3^2 * 5. So, ( frac{20}{90} = frac{2}{9} ), which is 0.222..., repeating. Not terminating.How about ( n = 25 )? ( n + 70 = 95 ). 95 is 5 * 19, which includes 19, so not allowed.( n = 30 ): ( n + 70 = 100 ). 100 is 2^2 * 5^2. So, ( frac{30}{100} = frac{3}{10} = 0.3 ), which is terminating. But 30 is larger than 10, so 10 is still the smallest.Wait, but earlier I thought ( n = 10 ) gives ( frac{10}{80} = frac{1}{8} ), which is terminating. So, 10 seems to be the answer. But let me check numbers between 70 and 80 again to make sure there isn't a smaller ( n ).Looking at 71 to 79:- 71: prime- 72: 2^3 * 3^2- 73: prime- 74: 2 * 37- 75: 3 * 5^2- 76: 2^2 * 19- 77: 7 * 11- 78: 2 * 3 * 13- 79: primeNone of these have only 2s and 5s as factors. So, the next number after 70 that is only 2s and 5s is indeed 80. Therefore, ( n = 10 ) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition.Wait, but I just realized something. If ( n + 70 ) is 80, which is 2^4 * 5, then ( n = 10 ). But what if ( n + 70 ) is a higher power of 2 or 5, but still results in a smaller ( n )? For example, if ( n + 70 = 125 ), which is 5^3, then ( n = 55 ). But 55 is larger than 10, so 10 is still smaller.Alternatively, if ( n + 70 = 128 ), which is 2^7, then ( n = 58 ). Again, larger than 10. So, 10 is still the smallest.Wait, but let me think again. If ( n + 70 ) is 80, which is 2^4 * 5, then ( n = 10 ). But is there a way to have ( n + 70 ) be a multiple of a higher power of 2 or 5, but still less than 80? For example, 64 is 2^6, but 64 is less than 70, so ( n = 64 - 70 = -6 ), which is not positive. So, that doesn't work.Similarly, 125 is 5^3, but that's 125, which is greater than 80, so ( n = 55 ). But 55 is larger than 10, so 10 is still the smallest.Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check ( n = 10 ) again. ( frac{10}{80} = frac{1}{8} = 0.125 ), which is terminating. So, that works.But what if ( n + 70 ) is 100, which is 2^2 * 5^2, then ( n = 30 ). ( frac{30}{100} = frac{3}{10} = 0.3 ), which is also terminating. But 30 is larger than 10, so 10 is still smaller.Wait, but maybe there's a smaller ( n ) where ( n + 70 ) is a multiple of a higher power of 2 or 5, but still results in a denominator with only 2s and 5s after simplifying. For example, if ( n = 14 ), ( n + 70 = 84 ). 84 factors into 2^2 * 3 * 7. So, ( frac{14}{84} = frac{1}{6} ), which is 0.1666..., repeating. Not terminating.Similarly, ( n = 15 ): ( n + 70 = 85 ). 85 is 5 * 17, so not allowed.( n = 16 ): ( n + 70 = 86 ). 86 is 2 * 43, which includes 43, so no.( n = 18 ): ( n + 70 = 88 ). 88 is 2^3 * 11, which includes 11, so no.( n = 20 ): ( n + 70 = 90 ). 90 is 2 * 3^2 * 5, which includes 3, so no.( n = 22 ): ( n + 70 = 92 ). 92 is 2^2 * 23, which includes 23, so no.( n = 24 ): ( n + 70 = 94 ). 94 is 2 * 47, which includes 47, so no.( n = 25 ): ( n + 70 = 95 ). 95 is 5 * 19, which includes 19, so no.( n = 28 ): ( n + 70 = 98 ). 98 is 2 * 49, which is 2 * 7^2, so includes 7, no.( n = 30 ): ( n + 70 = 100 ). 100 is 2^2 * 5^2, which is good. So, ( frac{30}{100} = frac{3}{10} = 0.3 ), terminating. But 30 is larger than 10.Wait, so going back, the first number after 70 that is only 2s and 5s is 80, so ( n = 10 ). But let me check if there's a smaller ( n ) where ( n + 70 ) is a multiple of a higher power of 2 or 5, but still results in a denominator with only 2s and 5s after simplifying.For example, if ( n + 70 = 125 ), which is 5^3, then ( n = 55 ). ( frac{55}{125} = frac{11}{25} = 0.44 ), which is terminating. But 55 is larger than 10, so 10 is still smaller.Similarly, ( n + 70 = 128 ), which is 2^7, ( n = 58 ). ( frac{58}{128} = frac{29}{64} = 0.453125 ), which is terminating. But again, 58 is larger than 10.So, it seems that 10 is indeed the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) is a terminating decimal.Wait, but let me think again. If ( n + 70 ) is 80, which is 2^4 * 5, then ( n = 10 ). But what if ( n + 70 ) is a multiple of both 2 and 5, but in a way that when simplified, the denominator is still only 2s and 5s. For example, if ( n + 70 = 100 ), which is 2^2 * 5^2, then ( n = 30 ). But 30 is larger than 10.Alternatively, if ( n + 70 = 160 ), which is 2^5 * 5, then ( n = 90 ). ( frac{90}{160} = frac{9}{16} = 0.5625 ), which is terminating. But 90 is way larger than 10.Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that ( n + 70 ) must be of the form 2^k * 5^m. The smallest such number greater than 70 is 80, so ( n = 10 ).But let me double-check. If ( n = 10 ), then ( n + 70 = 80 ). So, ( frac{10}{80} = frac{1}{8} = 0.125 ), which is terminating. Yes, that works.Is there any number between 70 and 80 that is of the form 2^k * 5^m? Let's see:- 72: 2^3 * 3^2 (has 3)- 75: 3 * 5^2 (has 3)- 80: 2^4 * 5 (only 2 and 5)So, 80 is the next number after 70 that fits the criteria. Therefore, ( n = 10 ) is indeed the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition.Wait, but I just thought of something else. What if ( n ) and ( n + 70 ) share a common factor that allows the simplified denominator to be only 2s and 5s, even if ( n + 70 ) itself has other prime factors? For example, if ( n + 70 ) is 90, which is 2 * 3^2 * 5, but if ( n ) is a multiple of 3, then ( frac{n}{90} ) could simplify to a denominator without 3.Let me test this. Suppose ( n = 30 ). Then ( n + 70 = 100 ). ( frac{30}{100} = frac{3}{10} = 0.3 ), which is terminating. So, that works, but ( n = 30 ) is larger than 10.Alternatively, ( n = 15 ). ( n + 70 = 85 ). ( frac{15}{85} = frac{3}{17} ), which is not terminating.( n = 20 ). ( n + 70 = 90 ). ( frac{20}{90} = frac{2}{9} ), which is not terminating.( n = 25 ). ( n + 70 = 95 ). ( frac{25}{95} = frac{5}{19} ), which is not terminating.( n = 35 ). ( n + 70 = 105 ). ( frac{35}{105} = frac{1}{3} ), which is not terminating.So, even if ( n ) shares a common factor with ( n + 70 ), unless ( n + 70 ) itself is only composed of 2s and 5s, the simplified denominator might still have other prime factors. Therefore, the only way to guarantee that ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) is a terminating decimal is if ( n + 70 ) is of the form 2^k * 5^m.Thus, the smallest ( n ) is 10, because ( 10 + 70 = 80 = 2^4 * 5 ).Wait, but earlier I thought maybe ( n = 55 ) because ( 55 + 70 = 125 = 5^3 ). But 55 is larger than 10, so 10 is still the smallest.I think I've considered all possibilities. The smallest positive integer ( n ) such that ( frac{n}{n + 70} ) is a terminating decimal is 10."},{"question":"What least number should be added to 1024, so that the sum is completely divisible by the product of the following prime numbers: 17, 23, and 29?","answer":"First, I need to determine the product of the prime numbers 17, 23, and 29.

Additionally, let (a) and (b) denote the lengths of the sides (BC) and (CA) respectively. Prove that if[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( a tan alpha + b tan beta right), ]then triangle (ABC) is isosceles.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to prove that if a certain equation holds in a triangle ABC, then the triangle must be isosceles. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let's restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have triangle ABC with angles α, β, and γ at vertices A, B, and C respectively. The sides opposite these angles are a, b, and c. The given condition is:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( a tan alpha + b tan beta right) ]And we need to prove that under this condition, triangle ABC is isosceles. An isosceles triangle has at least two sides equal, which also means that the angles opposite those sides are equal. So, if I can show that either a = b, or α = β, or something similar, then the triangle is isosceles.Okay, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities and triangle properties that might help here. I know that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so α + β + γ = 180°. Also, the Law of Sines relates the sides and angles: a/sin α = b/sin β = c/sin γ.Another thing that comes to mind is the tangent of half-angles in a triangle. There's a formula for tan(γ/2) in terms of the sides and the semiperimeter, but I'm not sure if that will be directly useful here. Maybe I should try to manipulate the given equation to see if I can express it in terms of sines and cosines.Let me write down the given equation again:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( a tan alpha + b tan beta right) ]I can rewrite tan(γ/2) using the identity:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin gamma}{1 + cos gamma} ]But I'm not sure if that helps immediately. Alternatively, I can express tan α and tan β in terms of sine and cosine:[ tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} ][ tan beta = frac{sin beta}{cos beta} ]So substituting these into the equation:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( a frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + b frac{sin beta}{cos beta} right) ]Hmm, maybe I can factor out the tan(γ/2):[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( frac{a sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{b sin beta}{cos beta} right) ]Now, I wonder if I can relate this to the Law of Sines. Since a/sin α = b/sin β = c/sin γ = 2R, where R is the circumradius, I can express a and b in terms of sine functions:[ a = 2R sin alpha ][ b = 2R sin beta ]Let me substitute these into the equation:[ 2R sin alpha + 2R sin beta = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( frac{2R sin alpha sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{2R sin beta sin beta}{cos beta} right) ]Simplify the left side:[ 2R (sin alpha + sin beta) = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( 2R left( frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} right) right) ]We can cancel out the 2R from both sides:[ sin alpha + sin beta = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} right) ]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider the original equation again:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan beta) ]I can divide both sides by a + b to get:[ 1 = tan frac{gamma}{2} left( frac{a tan alpha + b tan beta}{a + b} right) ]So,[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} ]Is this helpful? Maybe. Let me think about the relationship between the angles. Since α + β + γ = 180°, we can express γ as 180° - α - β. Therefore, γ/2 = 90° - (α + β)/2.So,[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = tan left( 90° - frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Because tan(90° - x) = cot x.So,[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Therefore, the equation becomes:[ cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} ]Hmm, maybe I can express cot in terms of sine and cosine:[ cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} ]So,[ frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} ]Let me see if I can manipulate the right side. Let's write tan α and tan β as sin/cos:[ frac{a + b}{a frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + b frac{sin beta}{cos beta}} ]So,[ frac{a + b}{frac{a sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{b sin beta}{cos beta}} ]Let me write this as:[ frac{a + b}{frac{a sin alpha cos beta + b sin beta cos alpha}{cos alpha cos beta}} ]Which simplifies to:[ frac{(a + b) cos alpha cos beta}{a sin alpha cos beta + b sin beta cos alpha} ]So now, the equation is:[ frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = frac{(a + b) cos alpha cos beta}{a sin alpha cos beta + b sin beta cos alpha} ]Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Maybe I can use the sine addition formula on the denominator. Recall that sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So, the denominator is:[ a sin alpha cos beta + b sin beta cos alpha ]But unless a = b, this doesn't directly simplify to a single sine term. Maybe I need to think differently.Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the sides are related to the angles via the Law of Sines:[ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma} = 2R ]Where R is the circumradius. So, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of sine functions:[ a = 2R sin alpha ][ b = 2R sin beta ]Let me substitute these into the equation:[ frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = frac{(2R sin alpha + 2R sin beta) cos alpha cos beta}{2R sin alpha sin alpha cos beta + 2R sin beta sin beta cos alpha} ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator:[ (2R (sin alpha + sin beta)) cos alpha cos beta ]Denominator:[ 2R (sin^2 alpha cos beta + sin^2 beta cos alpha) ]We can cancel out the 2R:[ frac{(sin alpha + sin beta) cos alpha cos beta}{sin^2 alpha cos beta + sin^2 beta cos alpha} ]So the equation becomes:[ cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = frac{(sin alpha + sin beta) cos alpha cos beta}{sin^2 alpha cos beta + sin^2 beta cos alpha} ]This still looks complicated. Maybe I can factor the denominator:Denominator:[ sin^2 alpha cos beta + sin^2 beta cos alpha = sin alpha sin beta (sin alpha cot beta + sin beta cot alpha) ]Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out sin α cos β and sin β cos α:But I don't see an immediate simplification. Maybe I should try to express everything in terms of sum and difference angles.Recall that:[ sin alpha + sin beta = 2 sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) ]And:[ sin^2 alpha = frac{1 - cos 2alpha}{2} ][ sin^2 beta = frac{1 - cos 2beta}{2} ]But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for cos(A - B):[ cos(alpha - beta) = cos alpha cos beta + sin alpha sin beta ]But I don't see how that directly helps here.Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as:[ sin^2 alpha cos beta + sin^2 beta cos alpha = sin alpha sin beta (sin alpha cot beta + sin beta cot alpha) ]But that seems more complicated.Let me think differently. Maybe instead of substituting a and b from the Law of Sines, I can use the tangent of half-angle formulas.Recall that in a triangle, tan(γ/2) can be expressed as:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin gamma}{1 + cos gamma} ]But I also know that in triangle ABC, γ = 180° - α - β, so:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = tan left( 90° - frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Which is what I had earlier.So, going back to the equation:[ cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} ]Let me denote θ = (α + β)/2, so that:[ cot theta = frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} ]But θ = (α + β)/2, and since α + β + γ = 180°, θ = (180° - γ)/2 = 90° - γ/2.So, θ = 90° - γ/2, which means that:[ cot theta = tan frac{gamma}{2} ]Which is consistent with earlier.But I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe I can express tan α and tan β in terms of θ.Since θ = (α + β)/2, let me define φ = (α - β)/2. Then, α = θ + φ and β = θ - φ.So, tan α = tan(θ + φ) and tan β = tan(θ - φ).Using the tangent addition formula:[ tan(θ + φ) = frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} ][ tan(θ - φ) = frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ} ]So, substituting these into the equation:[ cot θ = frac{a + b}{a cdot frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} + b cdot frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ}} ]This seems even more complicated. Maybe I need to take a different approach.Let me consider the original equation again:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan beta) ]I can rearrange this equation to:[ frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} = tan frac{gamma}{2} ]Earlier, I expressed tan(γ/2) as cot((α + β)/2). So,[ frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Let me denote S = a + b and T = a tan α + b tan β. So,[ frac{S}{T} = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Which implies:[ S = T cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, maybe I can express cot((α + β)/2) in terms of sine and cosine:[ cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} ]So,[ S = T cdot frac{cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} ]Which can be rewritten as:[ S sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = T cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Substituting back S and T:[ (a + b) sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = (a tan alpha + b tan beta) cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Let me express tan α and tan β as sin/cos:[ (a + b) sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = left( a frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + b frac{sin beta}{cos beta} right) cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Multiply through:[ (a + b) sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = left( frac{a sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{b sin beta}{cos beta} right) cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Let me write this as:[ (a + b) sin theta = left( frac{a sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{b sin beta}{cos beta} right) cos theta ]Where θ = (α + β)/2.Hmm, maybe I can express a and b in terms of the Law of Sines again. Since a = 2R sin α and b = 2R sin β, let's substitute these:[ (2R sin alpha + 2R sin beta) sin theta = left( frac{2R sin alpha sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{2R sin beta sin beta}{cos beta} right) cos theta ]Simplify:[ 2R (sin alpha + sin beta) sin theta = 2R left( frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} right) cos theta ]Cancel out the 2R:[ (sin alpha + sin beta) sin theta = left( frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} right) cos theta ]Let me express sin α + sin β using the sum formula:[ sin alpha + sin beta = 2 sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) = 2 sin theta cos phi ]Where φ = (α - β)/2.Similarly, let's look at the other terms. The denominator terms in the fractions are cos α and cos β. Maybe I can express them in terms of θ and φ as well.Since α = θ + φ and β = θ - φ, we have:[ cos alpha = cos (theta + φ) = cos theta cos φ - sin theta sin φ ][ cos beta = cos (theta - φ) = cos theta cos φ + sin theta sin φ ]Similarly,[ sin alpha = sin (theta + φ) = sin theta cos φ + cos theta sin φ ][ sin beta = sin (theta - φ) = sin theta cos φ - cos theta sin φ ]Let me compute sin^2 α / cos α:[ frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} = frac{(sin theta cos φ + cos theta sin φ)^2}{cos (theta + φ)} ]This seems messy. Maybe instead of expanding, I can find a relationship between the numerator and denominator.Wait, perhaps I can factor the denominator:[ frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} ]Let me write this as:[ sin alpha tan alpha + sin beta tan beta ]But tan α = sin α / cos α, so:[ sin alpha cdot frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + sin beta cdot frac{sin beta}{cos beta} = frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin^2 beta}{cos beta} ]Which is what we have.Alternatively, maybe I can write sin^2 α as 1 - cos^2 α:[ frac{1 - cos^2 alpha}{cos alpha} = frac{1}{cos alpha} - cos alpha ]Similarly for sin^2 β:[ frac{1 - cos^2 beta}{cos beta} = frac{1}{cos beta} - cos beta ]So, the expression becomes:[ left( frac{1}{cos alpha} - cos alpha + frac{1}{cos beta} - cos beta right) cos theta ]So, the equation is:[ (sin alpha + sin beta) sin theta = left( frac{1}{cos alpha} + frac{1}{cos beta} - cos alpha - cos beta right) cos theta ]Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to think about specific cases or make an assumption to see if it leads to a contradiction or a valid conclusion.Suppose that triangle ABC is isosceles with a = b. Then, α = β. Let's see if the original equation holds.If a = b, then:Left side: a + a = 2aRight side: tan(γ/2) (a tan α + a tan α) = tan(γ/2) * 2a tan αSo,2a = 2a tan(γ/2) tan αDivide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):1 = tan(γ/2) tan αBut in an isosceles triangle with a = b, γ = 180° - 2αSo, γ/2 = 90° - αThus,tan(γ/2) = tan(90° - α) = cot αSo,tan(γ/2) tan α = cot α * tan α = 1Which satisfies the equation. So, if a = b, then the equation holds. But we need to show the converse: if the equation holds, then a = b.So, maybe I can assume that a ≠ b and reach a contradiction.Suppose a ≠ b. Then, from the original equation:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan beta) ]Let me rearrange this:[ frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} = tan frac{gamma}{2} ]But earlier, we saw that:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]So,[ frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) ]Let me denote θ = (α + β)/2, so:[ frac{a + b}{a tan alpha + b tan beta} = cot θ ]But since θ = (α + β)/2, and γ = 180° - α - β, we have θ = 90° - γ/2.So,[ cot θ = tan frac{gamma}{2} ]Which is consistent.But I need to relate this to the sides a and b. Maybe I can express tan α and tan β in terms of θ and φ, where φ = (α - β)/2.So, α = θ + φ and β = θ - φ.Then,tan α = tan(θ + φ) = (tan θ + tan φ)/(1 - tan θ tan φ)tan β = tan(θ - φ) = (tan θ - tan φ)/(1 + tan θ tan φ)Substituting these into the equation:[ frac{a + b}{a cdot frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} + b cdot frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ}} = cot θ ]This seems complicated, but maybe I can cross-multiply and simplify.Let me denote T = tan θ and t = tan φ for simplicity.So,[ frac{a + b}{a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t}} = frac{1}{T} ]Cross-multiplying:[ (a + b) T = a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} ]Multiply both sides by (1 - T t)(1 + T t) to eliminate denominators:[ (a + b) T (1 - T^2 t^2) = a (T + t)(1 + T t) + b (T - t)(1 - T t) ]This is getting really messy. Maybe I need to consider specific values or look for symmetry.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sum of two sides is greater than the third, but I'm not sure how that applies here.Wait, another idea: maybe use the Law of Cosines. Since we're dealing with angles and sides, perhaps expressing cos γ in terms of sides can help.Law of Cosines says:[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos gamma ]But I don't see how this directly relates to the given equation.Alternatively, perhaps express tan(γ/2) in terms of the sides. There's a formula for tan(γ/2) in terms of the sides and the semiperimeter.Recall that:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin gamma}{1 + cos gamma} ]And using the Law of Cosines:[ cos gamma = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} ][ sin gamma = sqrt{1 - cos^2 gamma} ]But this might not be helpful.Wait, another formula for tan(γ/2):[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{(s - a)(s - b)}{s(s - c)} ]Where s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.But I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe use the formula:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin gamma}{1 + cos gamma} ]And express sin γ and cos γ in terms of sides.But again, this seems like a detour.Let me try to think differently. Suppose that the triangle is not isosceles, so a ≠ b and α ≠ β. Then, can the given equation still hold?If a ≠ b, then the equation:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan beta) ]Would require a specific relationship between a, b, α, and β. Maybe this relationship can only hold if a = b.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of a to b.Let me define k = a/b. Then, a = k b.Substituting into the equation:[ k b + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (k b tan alpha + b tan beta) ]Factor out b:[ b(k + 1) = b tan frac{gamma}{2} (k tan alpha + tan beta) ]Cancel out b (assuming b ≠ 0):[ k + 1 = tan frac{gamma}{2} (k tan alpha + tan beta) ]So,[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{k + 1}{k tan alpha + tan beta} ]But from the Law of Sines, a/sin α = b/sin β, so k = a/b = sin α / sin β.So, k = sin α / sin β.Let me substitute this into the equation:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} + 1}{frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} tan alpha + tan beta} ]Simplify numerator:[ frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{sin beta} ]Denominator:[ frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} cdot frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} = frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin beta cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} ]So,[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{sin beta}}{frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin beta cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta}} ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator:[ frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{sin beta} = frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} + 1 = k + 1 ]Denominator:[ frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin beta cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} = frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin beta cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} ]Let me factor out 1/sin β:[ frac{1}{sin beta} left( frac{sin^2 alpha}{cos alpha} + sin beta cdot frac{sin beta}{cos beta} right) ]But this doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I can write sin^2 α as 1 - cos^2 α:[ frac{1 - cos^2 alpha}{sin beta cos alpha} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} ]Which is:[ frac{1}{sin beta cos alpha} - frac{cos alpha}{sin beta} + frac{sin beta}{cos beta} ]This seems too fragmented. Maybe I need to consider another identity.Wait, going back to the Law of Sines, since k = sin α / sin β, and from the Law of Sines, a/sin α = b/sin β = c/sin γ, so c = 2R sin γ.But I don't see how this helps.Alternatively, maybe I can express tan(γ/2) in terms of sides a and b.Recall that in triangle ABC, tan(γ/2) can be expressed as:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{(s - a)(s - b)}{s(s - c)} ]Where s = (a + b + c)/2.But this might not be directly useful.Alternatively, using the formula:[ tan frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin gamma}{1 + cos gamma} ]And from the Law of Cosines:[ cos gamma = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} ][ sin gamma = sqrt{1 - cos^2 gamma} ]But this seems too involved.Wait, another idea: maybe use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, so γ = 180° - α - β. Therefore, tan(γ/2) = tan(90° - (α + β)/2) = cot((α + β)/2).So, tan(γ/2) = cot((α + β)/2).Therefore, the original equation becomes:[ a + b = cot left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) (a tan alpha + b tan beta) ]Let me denote θ = (α + β)/2, so:[ a + b = cot θ (a tan alpha + b tan β) ]But θ = (α + β)/2, so α = θ + φ and β = θ - φ, where φ = (α - β)/2.So, tan α = tan(θ + φ) and tan β = tan(θ - φ).Using the tangent addition formulas:[ tan(θ + φ) = frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} ][ tan(θ - φ) = frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ} ]Substituting these into the equation:[ a + b = cot θ left( a cdot frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} + b cdot frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ} right) ]Let me denote T = tan θ and t = tan φ for simplicity:[ a + b = frac{1}{T} left( a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} right) ]Multiply both sides by T:[ T(a + b) = a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} ]Let me combine the terms on the right side:[ T(a + b) = a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} ]To combine these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is (1 - T t)(1 + T t):[ T(a + b) = frac{a(T + t)(1 + T t) + b(T - t)(1 - T t)}{(1 - T t)(1 + T t)} ]Multiply both sides by (1 - T t)(1 + T t):[ T(a + b)(1 - T^2 t^2) = a(T + t)(1 + T t) + b(T - t)(1 - T t) ]This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to make an assumption or find a relationship between a and b.Wait, another idea: suppose that a = b. Then, the equation simplifies, and we saw earlier that it holds. So, if a = b, the equation is satisfied. Now, we need to show that if the equation is satisfied, then a = b.Alternatively, suppose that a ≠ b, and see if we can derive a contradiction.Let me assume that a ≠ b, and see if the equation can still hold.From the equation:[ a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan β) ]Let me express tan(γ/2) as cot((α + β)/2):[ a + b = cot left( frac{alpha + β}{2} right) (a tan α + b tan β) ]Let me denote θ = (α + β)/2, so:[ a + b = cot θ (a tan α + b tan β) ]But α = θ + φ and β = θ - φ, so:[ a + b = cot θ left( a tan(θ + φ) + b tan(θ - φ) right) ]Using the tangent addition formulas:[ tan(θ + φ) = frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} ][ tan(θ - φ) = frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ} ]Substituting these:[ a + b = cot θ left( a cdot frac{tan θ + tan φ}{1 - tan θ tan φ} + b cdot frac{tan θ - tan φ}{1 + tan θ tan φ} right) ]Let me denote T = tan θ and t = tan φ:[ a + b = frac{1}{T} left( a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} right) ]Multiply both sides by T:[ T(a + b) = a cdot frac{T + t}{1 - T t} + b cdot frac{T - t}{1 + T t} ]Let me combine the terms on the right side:[ T(a + b) = frac{a(T + t)(1 + T t) + b(T - t)(1 - T t)}{(1 - T t)(1 + T t)} ]Multiply both sides by (1 - T t)(1 + T t):[ T(a + b)(1 - T^2 t^2) = a(T + t)(1 + T t) + b(T - t)(1 - T t) ]This is a complicated equation, but maybe I can expand both sides and see if terms cancel out.First, expand the left side:[ T(a + b)(1 - T^2 t^2) = T(a + b) - T^3 t^2 (a + b) ]Now, expand the right side:First term: a(T + t)(1 + T t) = a(T + t + T^2 t + T t^2)Second term: b(T - t)(1 - T t) = b(T - t - T^2 t + T t^2)So, combining these:Right side = a(T + t + T^2 t + T t^2) + b(T - t - T^2 t + T t^2)= aT + a t + a T^2 t + a T t^2 + bT - b t - b T^2 t + b T t^2Group like terms:= (aT + bT) + (a t - b t) + (a T^2 t - b T^2 t) + (a T t^2 + b T t^2)Factor out T, t, T^2 t, T t^2:= T(a + b) + t(a - b) + T^2 t(a - b) + T t^2(a + b)So, the right side becomes:[ T(a + b) + t(a - b) + T^2 t(a - b) + T t^2(a + b) ]Now, set the left side equal to the right side:[ T(a + b) - T^3 t^2 (a + b) = T(a + b) + t(a - b) + T^2 t(a - b) + T t^2(a + b) ]Subtract T(a + b) from both sides:[ - T^3 t^2 (a + b) = t(a - b) + T^2 t(a - b) + T t^2(a + b) ]Factor out t on the right side:[ - T^3 t^2 (a + b) = t [ (a - b) + T^2 (a - b) + T t (a + b) ] ]Let me factor out (a - b) from the first two terms:[ - T^3 t^2 (a + b) = t [ (a - b)(1 + T^2) + T t (a + b) ] ]Now, let's write this as:[ - T^3 t^2 (a + b) = t (a - b)(1 + T^2) + t^2 T (a + b) ]Bring all terms to one side:[ - T^3 t^2 (a + b) - t (a - b)(1 + T^2) - t^2 T (a + b) = 0 ]Factor out t:[ t [ - T^3 t (a + b) - (a - b)(1 + T^2) - t T (a + b) ] = 0 ]So, either t = 0 or the expression in brackets is zero.Case 1: t = 0t = tan φ = 0, which implies φ = 0°, so α = β.Therefore, α = β, which means that the triangle is isosceles with a = b.Case 2: The expression in brackets is zero:[ - T^3 t (a + b) - (a - b)(1 + T^2) - t T (a + b) = 0 ]Let me factor out (a + b):[ - (a + b)(T^3 t + t T) - (a - b)(1 + T^2) = 0 ]Factor t from the first term:[ - t T (a + b)(T^2 + 1) - (a - b)(1 + T^2) = 0 ]Factor out (1 + T^2):[ - (1 + T^2) [ t T (a + b) + (a - b) ] = 0 ]Since (1 + T^2) is always positive (as T is real), we have:[ t T (a + b) + (a - b) = 0 ]So,[ t T (a + b) = b - a ]But t = tan φ and T = tan θ, and θ = (α + β)/2, φ = (α - β)/2.So,[ tan θ tan φ (a + b) = b - a ]But from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin α and b = 2R sin β, so:[ tan θ tan φ (2R sin α + 2R sin β) = 2R sin β - 2R sin α ]Cancel out 2R:[ tan θ tan φ (sin α + sin β) = sin β - sin α ]Express sin α + sin β and sin β - sin α using sum and difference formulas:[ sin α + sin β = 2 sin left( frac{α + β}{2} right) cos left( frac{α - β}{2} right) = 2 sin θ cos φ ][ sin β - sin α = -2 cos left( frac{α + β}{2} right) sin left( frac{α - β}{2} right) = -2 cos θ sin φ ]So, substituting these:[ tan θ tan φ (2 sin θ cos φ) = -2 cos θ sin φ ]Simplify:Left side: 2 tan θ tan φ sin θ cos φBut tan θ = sin θ / cos θ and tan φ = sin φ / cos φ, so:Left side: 2 (sin θ / cos θ)(sin φ / cos φ) sin θ cos φ = 2 (sin^2 θ sin φ) / cos θRight side: -2 cos θ sin φSo,[ frac{2 sin^2 θ sin φ}{cos θ} = -2 cos θ sin φ ]Divide both sides by 2 sin φ (assuming sin φ ≠ 0, which it isn't since φ ≠ 0°):[ frac{sin^2 θ}{cos θ} = - cos θ ]Multiply both sides by cos θ:[ sin^2 θ = - cos^2 θ ]But sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1, so this implies:[ sin^2 θ = - cos^2 θ ][ sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 0 ][ 1 = 0 ]Which is a contradiction.Therefore, Case 2 leads to a contradiction, so the only possibility is Case 1, where t = 0, which implies φ = 0°, so α = β, and hence a = b.Therefore, the triangle must be isosceles with a = b.**Final Answer**boxed{ABC text{ is isosceles}}"},{"question":"Given that the expansion of (1+x+x^{2})(x+ frac {1}{x^{3}})^{n} has no constant term, where n in mathbb{N}^{*}, 2 leqslant n leqslant 8, find the value of n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of n, where n is a positive integer between 2 and 8 inclusive, such that when I expand the expression (1 + x + x²)(x + 1/x³)^n, there is no constant term. That means, after expanding everything, the coefficient of x⁰ should be zero.Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that (x + 1/x³)^n is a binomial expression, and when expanded, it will have terms of the form C(n, r) * x^(n - r) * (1/x³)^r, right? So simplifying that, each term would be C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r). So, the expansion of (x + 1/x³)^n will have terms with exponents of x ranging from n (when r=0) down to n - 4n = -3n (when r=n). So, the exponents go from n to -3n in steps of 4, I think.Now, when I multiply this expansion by (1 + x + x²), I need to make sure that the constant term (x⁰) in the resulting product is zero. That means, for each term in (x + 1/x³)^n, when multiplied by 1, x, or x², the exponents should not add up to zero.Let me write this out more formally. Let's denote the expansion of (x + 1/x³)^n as the sum from r=0 to r=n of C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r). Then, multiplying by (1 + x + x²), the entire expression becomes:Sum from r=0 to r=n of C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r) * (1 + x + x²)Which can be rewritten as:Sum from r=0 to r=n of [C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r) + C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r + 1) + C(n, r) * x^(n - 4r + 2)]So, the exponents of x in the product are n - 4r, n - 4r + 1, and n - 4r + 2 for each r.We need the coefficient of x⁰ to be zero. That means, for each r, if n - 4r = 0, n - 4r + 1 = 0, or n - 4r + 2 = 0, the corresponding term should not exist or should cancel out. But since we are dealing with binomial coefficients, which are positive, the only way for the total coefficient to be zero is if none of these exponents equal zero for any r.Wait, that might not be entirely accurate. Because even if individual terms contribute to x⁰, their coefficients could add up to zero. But in this case, since all coefficients are positive, the only way the total coefficient is zero is if none of the terms contribute to x⁰. So, we need to ensure that for all r, n - 4r ≠ 0, n - 4r + 1 ≠ 0, and n - 4r + 2 ≠ 0.So, let's write down the conditions:1. There does not exist an integer r such that n - 4r = 0.2. There does not exist an integer r such that n - 4r + 1 = 0.3. There does not exist an integer r such that n - 4r + 2 = 0.So, translating these into equations:1. n ≠ 4r2. n ≠ 4r - 13. n ≠ 4r - 2For some integer r between 0 and n.But since n is between 2 and 8, let's list possible values of n and check these conditions.Let me make a table:n | Check if n is 4r, 4r-1, or 4r-2 for some r--- | ---2 | 4r=2 => r=0.5 (not integer). 4r-1=2 => r=0.75 (not integer). 4r-2=2 => r=1. So, r=1 is integer. So, n=2 is 4*1 - 2. So, condition 3 is violated. So, n=2 is bad.3 | 4r=3 => r=0.75 (no). 4r-1=3 => r=1. So, 4*1 -1=3. So, condition 2 is violated. So, n=3 is bad.4 | 4r=4 => r=1. So, condition 1 is violated. So, n=4 is bad.5 | 4r=5 => r=1.25 (no). 4r-1=5 => r=1.5 (no). 4r-2=5 => r=(5+2)/4=1.75 (no). So, none of the conditions are violated. So, n=5 is good.6 | 4r=6 => r=1.5 (no). 4r-1=6 => r=1.75 (no). 4r-2=6 => r=2. So, 4*2 -2=6. So, condition 3 is violated. So, n=6 is bad.7 | 4r=7 => r=1.75 (no). 4r-1=7 => r=2. So, 4*2 -1=7. So, condition 2 is violated. So, n=7 is bad.8 | 4r=8 => r=2. So, condition 1 is violated. So, n=8 is bad.So, the only n in 2 to 8 that satisfies all three conditions is n=5.Wait, let me double-check for n=5.For n=5, we need to check if there exists r such that:1. 5=4r => r=1.25 (not integer)2. 5=4r -1 => 4r=6 => r=1.5 (not integer)3. 5=4r -2 => 4r=7 => r=1.75 (not integer)So, none of these r are integers, which means that in the expansion of (x + 1/x³)^5, there are no terms with exponents 0, -1, or -2. Therefore, when multiplied by (1 + x + x²), none of the terms will result in a constant term. So, the coefficient of x⁰ will indeed be zero.Therefore, n=5 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)2left(x-1right)^{2}=18.<br/>(2)x^{2}-4x-3=0 (using the method of completing the square).","answer":"Okay, so I've got these two equations to solve. The first one is 2 times (x minus 1) squared equals 18, and the second one is x squared minus 4x minus 3 equals 0, and I need to use the method of completing the square for that one. Alright, let's start with the first problem.Alright, for the first equation: 2(x - 1)^2 = 18. Hmm, so I need to solve for x. Let me think. I remember that when you have something squared equals a number, you can take the square root of both sides to solve for the variable. But before I do that, maybe I should simplify the equation a bit.So, the equation is 2 times (x - 1) squared equals 18. Maybe I can divide both sides by 2 to make it simpler. If I do that, I get (x - 1)^2 = 9. Okay, that looks better. Now, to solve for x, I need to take the square root of both sides. So, the square root of (x - 1)^2 is just x - 1, and the square root of 9 is 3. But wait, I remember that when you take the square root, you have to consider both the positive and negative roots. So, it should be x - 1 equals plus or minus 3.Alright, so now I have two equations: x - 1 = 3 and x - 1 = -3. Let's solve each one separately. For the first one, x - 1 = 3, I can add 1 to both sides to get x by itself. So, x = 3 + 1, which is 4. For the second equation, x - 1 = -3, I'll also add 1 to both sides. So, x = -3 + 1, which is -2. So, the solutions are x = 4 and x = -2. That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to the second problem: x squared minus 4x minus 3 equals 0. I need to solve this using the method of completing the square. Okay, completing the square is a technique where you turn a quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial, which is easier to solve. Let me recall the steps.First, I think I need to get the equation in the form of x squared plus bx equals c. So, I'll move the constant term to the other side. That means I'll add 3 to both sides. So, x squared minus 4x equals 3. Now, to complete the square, I need to find a number that, when added to both sides, will make the left side a perfect square trinomial.I remember that the formula for completing the square involves taking half of the coefficient of x, squaring it, and adding it to both sides. The coefficient of x here is -4. So, half of -4 is -2, and squaring that gives me 4. So, I'll add 4 to both sides of the equation. That gives me x squared minus 4x plus 4 equals 3 plus 4, which simplifies to 7.Now, the left side should be a perfect square. Let me check: x squared minus 4x plus 4 is indeed (x - 2)^2. So, the equation becomes (x - 2)^2 equals 7. To solve for x, I'll take the square root of both sides. The square root of (x - 2)^2 is x - 2, and the square root of 7 is plus or minus the square root of 7. So, x - 2 equals plus or minus the square root of 7.Finally, I'll solve for x by adding 2 to both sides. So, x equals 2 plus the square root of 7 and x equals 2 minus the square root of 7. That gives me the two solutions for x.Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with x squared minus 4x minus 3 equals 0, I moved the constant term to the other side to get x squared minus 4x equals 3. Then, I completed the square by adding 4 to both sides, resulting in (x - 2)^2 equals 7. Taking the square root of both sides gives x - 2 equals plus or minus the square root of 7, and adding 2 to both sides gives x equals 2 plus or minus the square root of 7. Yeah, that seems correct.I think I've got both problems solved. The first one had two solutions, x equals 4 and x equals -2, and the second one also has two solutions, x equals 2 plus the square root of 7 and x equals 2 minus the square root of 7. I should probably write them down clearly so I don't forget.For the first equation: 2(x - 1)^2 = 18- Divide both sides by 2: (x - 1)^2 = 9- Take square roots: x - 1 = ±3- Solve for x: x = 1 ± 3- So, x = 4 and x = -2For the second equation: x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0- Move the constant term: x^2 - 4x = 3- Complete the square: add (4/2)^2 = 4 to both sides- So, x^2 - 4x + 4 = 7- Rewrite as a perfect square: (x - 2)^2 = 7- Take square roots: x - 2 = ±√7- Solve for x: x = 2 ± √7Yeah, that all checks out. I think I'm confident with these solutions."},{"question":"A rectangular grassy plot 110 m by 65 m has a gravel path 2.5 m wide all round it on the inside. The cost of gravelling the path at a certain rate per sq. meter is 510. What is the rate per sq. meter for gravelling the path?","answer":"First, I need to determine the area of the gravel path. The total area of the grassy plot including the gravel path is 110 meters multiplied by 65 meters, which equals 7150 square meters.Next, I'll calculate the dimensions of the grassy plot without the gravel path. Since the gravel path is 2.5 meters wide on all sides, I'll subtract twice this width from both the length and the width of the plot. This gives me a length of 105 meters and a width of 60 meters.The area of the grassy plot without the gravel path is then 105 meters multiplied by 60 meters, resulting in 6300 square meters.To find the area of the gravel path alone, I'll subtract the area of the grassy plot without the gravel path from the total area. This gives me 7150 square meters minus 6300 square meters, which equals 850 square meters.Given that the total cost of gravelling the path is 510, I'll divide this cost by the area of the gravel path to find the rate per square meter. So, 510 divided by 850 equals 0.6.Therefore, the rate per square meter for gravelling the path is 0.6."},{"question":"Let ( f ) be a bijection on the positive integers. Show that there exist three positive integers ( a_0 ), ( a_1 ), and ( a_2 ) in arithmetic progression such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < f(a_2) ). Is there necessarily an arithmetic progression ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{2003} ) such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < ldots < f(a_{2003}) )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that for any bijection ( f ) on the positive integers, there exist three positive integers ( a_0 ), ( a_1 ), and ( a_2 ) in arithmetic progression such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < f(a_2) ). Then, I also need to determine if there necessarily exists an arithmetic progression of length 2003 with the same property.First, let me understand what a bijection is. A bijection is a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). So, ( f ) maps each positive integer to a unique positive integer, and every positive integer is mapped to by some positive integer. That means ( f ) is essentially a permutation of the positive integers.Now, the first part of the problem is to show that there exist three numbers in arithmetic progression where their images under ( f ) are increasing. An arithmetic progression means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, I need to find ( a_0 ), ( a_1 ), and ( a_2 ) such that ( a_1 - a_0 = a_2 - a_1 ), which implies ( a_2 = 2a_1 - a_0 ).I think I can approach this by considering the properties of permutations. Since ( f ) is a bijection, it's a rearrangement of the positive integers. So, maybe I can use some kind of pigeonhole principle or Ramsey theory idea where, regardless of how you permute the integers, you can't avoid having some increasing sequence.Wait, but this is specifically about arithmetic progressions. Hmm. Maybe I can construct such a progression by looking at the behavior of ( f ) on certain sequences.Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I fix some starting point ( k ). Then, consider the sequence ( k, k+1, k+2, k+4, k+8, ldots ), doubling the step each time. Since ( f ) is a bijection, these values are all distinct. Now, if I look at the images ( f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2), f(k+4), f(k+8), ldots ), since there are infinitely many terms, and they are all positive integers, they can't all be decreasing. Because if they were decreasing, they would have to go to negative infinity, which isn't possible since we're dealing with positive integers.Therefore, there must be some point where the sequence stops decreasing and starts increasing. That is, there exists some ( n ) such that ( f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ). So, then, ( f(k) < f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ). Thus, ( k, k + 2^n, k + 2^{n+1} ) form an arithmetic progression with the desired property.Wait, is that right? Let me check. If ( k, k + 2^n, k + 2^{n+1} ) are in arithmetic progression, then the common difference is ( 2^n ). So, ( a_0 = k ), ( a_1 = k + 2^n ), ( a_2 = k + 2^{n+1} ). Then, ( a_1 - a_0 = 2^n ) and ( a_2 - a_1 = 2^{n+1} - (k + 2^n) = 2^{n+1} - k - 2^n = 2^n - k ). Wait, that doesn't seem like a constant difference unless ( k = 0 ), but ( k ) is a positive integer. Hmm, maybe my initial approach is flawed.Wait, no, actually, ( a_0 = k ), ( a_1 = k + 2^n ), ( a_2 = k + 2^{n+1} ). So, the differences are ( a_1 - a_0 = 2^n ) and ( a_2 - a_1 = 2^{n+1} - 2^n = 2^n ). Oh, right, so the common difference is ( 2^n ). So, that does form an arithmetic progression. So, that works.Therefore, regardless of how ( f ) is defined, as long as it's a bijection, we can always find such a three-term arithmetic progression where ( f ) is increasing.Okay, that seems solid. So, the first part is done.Now, the second part is asking if there necessarily exists an arithmetic progression of length 2003 with the same property. That is, can we always find ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{2002} ) in arithmetic progression such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < ldots < f(a_{2002}) )?Hmm, this seems more complicated. I suspect the answer is no, but I need to think carefully.Maybe I can construct a bijection ( f ) that avoids having such a long arithmetic progression. Let me try to think of a way to permute the integers so that no long arithmetic progression is increasing under ( f ).One idea is to use a permutation that \\"scrambles\\" the order in such a way that any long arithmetic progression will have some decreasing steps. For example, maybe partition the integers into blocks and permute within each block in a way that disrupts any potential increasing sequence.Alternatively, maybe use a permutation that alternates increasing and decreasing sequences in a controlled manner. But I need to ensure that no arithmetic progression of length 2003 is strictly increasing.Wait, actually, in Ramsey theory, there's a result that says that for any coloring, you can find arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. But here, we're dealing with permutations, not colorings. However, the idea might be similar.But in our case, it's about the images under ( f ) being increasing. So, perhaps, it's related to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, which is about monotonic subsequences in sequences of real numbers. But again, this is about arithmetic progressions, which adds another layer.Wait, actually, I remember that for any permutation of the natural numbers, you can find arbitrarily long increasing or decreasing sequences, but I'm not sure if they have to be in arithmetic progression.Wait, no, actually, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem is about subsequences, not necessarily arithmetic progressions. So, maybe it's a different concept.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of van der Waerden's theorem, which states that for any given coloring, there exists an arithmetic progression of a certain length. But again, this is about colorings, not permutations.Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's try to construct a specific permutation ( f ) that avoids having a 2003-term increasing arithmetic progression.One approach is to partition the integers into blocks where each block is of size 2002, and within each block, arrange the numbers in decreasing order. Then, between blocks, arrange them in increasing order. This way, any arithmetic progression that spans multiple blocks would have to go through decreasing sequences, thus preventing a long increasing progression.Wait, let me elaborate. Suppose we divide the positive integers into blocks ( B_1, B_2, B_3, ldots ), where each block ( B_i ) contains 2002 consecutive integers. Then, within each block ( B_i ), we define ( f ) to map the numbers in decreasing order. So, the first block ( B_1 = {1, 2, ldots, 2002} ) is mapped to ( {2002, 2001, ldots, 1} ). The next block ( B_2 = {2003, 2004, ldots, 4004} ) is mapped to ( {4004, 4003, ldots, 2003} ), and so on.Now, consider any arithmetic progression. If it lies entirely within a single block, then since the block is decreasing, the images under ( f ) would be decreasing, so there's no increasing subsequence of length 2003. If the arithmetic progression spans multiple blocks, then since each block is decreasing and the blocks themselves are increasing, the images would go up and down, preventing a long increasing sequence.Wait, but actually, if the arithmetic progression spans multiple blocks, it might go through several decreasing blocks, but the overall trend could still be increasing if the blocks themselves are increasing. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use a permutation that alternates between increasing and decreasing blocks in a way that disrupts any potential long arithmetic progression.Wait, another idea: use a permutation that maps each number ( n ) to ( n + k ) modulo some large number, but I'm not sure if that would prevent long increasing arithmetic progressions.Alternatively, maybe use a permutation based on bit-reversal or some other permutation that scrambles the order significantly.Wait, perhaps I can use a permutation that maps numbers in such a way that any arithmetic progression longer than a certain length will have some decreasing steps. For example, if I define ( f(n) ) such that it increases for a while, then decreases, then increases again, but in such a way that any long arithmetic progression would have to include both increasing and decreasing parts.But I'm not sure if that's sufficient. Maybe I need a more structured approach.Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of a permutation that is \\"anti-arithmetic\\" in some sense. That is, a permutation where no long arithmetic progression is monotonic.I recall that in combinatorics, there are permutations designed to avoid certain patterns, but I'm not sure if they specifically avoid long arithmetic progressions.Alternatively, maybe I can use a permutation that maps each number ( n ) to a number that is not in the same residue class modulo some number, thereby disrupting arithmetic progressions.Wait, perhaps if I partition the integers into residue classes modulo 2003, and then permute within each residue class in a decreasing manner. Then, any arithmetic progression would have to include numbers from different residue classes, which are mapped in a way that disrupts monotonicity.But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think.Suppose I partition the integers into residue classes modulo 2003, so each class is ( {2003k + r | k geq 0} ) for ( r = 0, 1, ldots, 2002 ). Then, within each residue class, I define ( f ) to map the numbers in decreasing order. So, for each ( r ), ( f(2003k + r) = 2003(2002 - k) + r ) or something like that.Wait, but this might not work because the arithmetic progression could still be increasing if it's constructed in a way that jumps across residue classes.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't sufficient.Wait, perhaps I need to use a more drastic permutation. For example, map each number ( n ) to ( n ) if ( n ) is odd, and to ( n + 1 ) if ( n ) is even. But that's just a simple permutation, and I don't think it prevents long arithmetic progressions.Wait, no, actually, that permutation is just swapping adjacent numbers, which might not be enough to disrupt long arithmetic progressions.Wait, maybe I can use a permutation that maps numbers in such a way that any arithmetic progression longer than a certain length must contain both even and odd numbers, which are mapped differently. But I'm not sure if that would necessarily disrupt the monotonicity.Alternatively, maybe I can use a permutation that maps numbers based on their binary representations, reversing the bits or something like that. But again, I'm not sure if that would prevent long arithmetic progressions.Wait, perhaps I can use a permutation that maps numbers in a way that any arithmetic progression longer than 2002 terms must have some decreasing steps. For example, if I define ( f(n) ) such that it increases for the first 2002 terms, then decreases, then increases again, but in such a way that any arithmetic progression longer than 2002 terms would have to include both increasing and decreasing parts.But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, maybe I can use a permutation that maps the first ( N ) numbers in increasing order, then the next ( N ) numbers in decreasing order, and so on, where ( N ) is chosen to be larger than 2003. Then, any arithmetic progression longer than ( N ) would have to include both increasing and decreasing parts, thus preventing a strictly increasing sequence.But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think.Suppose I set ( N = 2004 ). Then, the permutation ( f ) maps the first 2004 numbers in increasing order, the next 2004 numbers in decreasing order, the next 2004 in increasing, and so on. Now, consider an arithmetic progression of length 2003. If it's entirely within the first 2004 numbers, then it's increasing. If it's entirely within the next 2004 numbers, it's decreasing. If it spans across these blocks, then it would go from increasing to decreasing, thus not being strictly increasing.Wait, but actually, an arithmetic progression could start in the first block and end in the second block, but since the second block is decreasing, the images would go up and then down, preventing a strictly increasing sequence.Similarly, if the progression starts in the second block and ends in the third, which is increasing, it would go down and then up, again preventing a strictly increasing sequence.Therefore, such a permutation would prevent any arithmetic progression of length 2003 from being strictly increasing.Wait, but does this permutation actually work? Let me check.Suppose the first 2004 numbers are mapped to themselves, so ( f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, ldots, f(2004) = 2004 ). Then, the next 2004 numbers are mapped in decreasing order, so ( f(2005) = 4008, f(2006) = 4007, ldots, f(4008) = 2005 ). Then, the next 2004 numbers are mapped in increasing order again, ( f(4009) = 4009, f(4010) = 4010, ldots, f(6012) = 6012 ), and so on.Now, consider an arithmetic progression of length 2003. If it's entirely within the first 2004 numbers, then it's increasing, which is fine. But the problem is that we need to show that such a progression exists for any bijection, but in this case, we're constructing a bijection where it doesn't exist.Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking if such a progression necessarily exists for any bijection. So, if I can construct a bijection where it doesn't exist, then the answer is no.But in my current construction, the first 2004 numbers are increasing, so any arithmetic progression within them would be increasing. Therefore, this permutation doesn't prevent the existence of a 2003-term increasing arithmetic progression.Hmm, so maybe my approach is flawed.Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that no arithmetic progression of length 2003 is entirely within an increasing block. To do that, I need to make the increasing blocks shorter than 2003.Wait, but if I make the increasing blocks of size 2002, then any arithmetic progression longer than 2002 would have to span multiple blocks, which are decreasing, thus disrupting the monotonicity.Wait, let's try that. Suppose I partition the positive integers into blocks of size 2002, and within each block, I map the numbers in increasing order. Then, between blocks, I map them in decreasing order. So, the first block ( B_1 = {1, 2, ldots, 2002} ) is mapped to ( {1, 2, ldots, 2002} ). The next block ( B_2 = {2003, 2004, ldots, 4004} ) is mapped to ( {4004, 4003, ldots, 2003} ). The next block ( B_3 = {4005, ldots, 6006} ) is mapped to ( {4005, 4006, ldots, 6006} ), and so on.Now, consider an arithmetic progression of length 2003. If it's entirely within an increasing block, then it's increasing, which is fine. But if it spans multiple blocks, then it would have to go from an increasing block to a decreasing block, which would cause the images to decrease, thus preventing a strictly increasing sequence.Wait, but actually, the blocks themselves are increasing or decreasing. So, if an arithmetic progression starts in an increasing block and ends in a decreasing block, the images would go up and then down, thus not being strictly increasing.Similarly, if it starts in a decreasing block and ends in an increasing block, it would go down and then up.Therefore, in this permutation, any arithmetic progression longer than 2002 terms would have to span multiple blocks, thus having some decreasing steps, preventing it from being strictly increasing.Wait, but the first block is increasing, so an arithmetic progression entirely within the first block would be increasing. But the first block is of size 2002, so an arithmetic progression of length 2003 would have to go beyond the first block, thus entering the second block, which is decreasing. Therefore, the images would go up in the first block and then down in the second block, making the overall sequence not strictly increasing.Therefore, in this permutation, there is no arithmetic progression of length 2003 with strictly increasing images under ( f ).Thus, this shows that it's not necessarily true that such a progression exists for any bijection ( f ).Wait, but I need to make sure that this permutation is indeed a bijection. Yes, because within each block, the mapping is either increasing or decreasing, and each number is mapped to exactly once.Therefore, I've constructed a bijection ( f ) where no arithmetic progression of length 2003 has strictly increasing images under ( f ). Hence, the answer to the second part is no.So, in summary, for the first part, we can always find a three-term arithmetic progression with increasing images under ( f ), but for the second part, we can construct a bijection where no such long progression exists."},{"question":"The coefficient of the term containing x in the expansion of (1-x)(sqrt{x}-frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^{6} isA: 35B: 5C: -15D: -20","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the coefficient of the term containing ( x ) in the expansion of ( (1 - x)left( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ). The options are A: 35, B: 5, C: -15, D: -20. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, especially binomials, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem states that ( (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k ). So, maybe I can apply that here to expand ( left( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ).Let me write that out. Let ( a = sqrt{x} ) and ( b = -frac{1}{sqrt{x}} ). Then, the expansion would be ( sum_{k=0}^{6} binom{6}{k} (sqrt{x})^{6 - k} left( -frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^k ).Simplifying each term, ( (sqrt{x})^{6 - k} ) is ( x^{frac{6 - k}{2}} ), and ( left( -frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^k ) is ( (-1)^k x^{-frac{k}{2}} ). So, multiplying those together, each term becomes ( (-1)^k binom{6}{k} x^{frac{6 - k}{2} - frac{k}{2}} ).Simplifying the exponent: ( frac{6 - k}{2} - frac{k}{2} = frac{6 - 2k}{2} = 3 - k ). So, each term is ( (-1)^k binom{6}{k} x^{3 - k} ).Alright, so the expansion of ( left( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ) is ( sum_{k=0}^{6} (-1)^k binom{6}{k} x^{3 - k} ).Now, I need to multiply this entire expansion by ( (1 - x) ). So, the expression becomes ( (1 - x) times sum_{k=0}^{6} (-1)^k binom{6}{k} x^{3 - k} ).To find the coefficient of ( x ), I need to consider how multiplying by ( (1 - x) ) affects each term in the expansion. Specifically, each term ( x^{3 - k} ) will be multiplied by 1 and by ( -x ), resulting in terms ( x^{3 - k} ) and ( -x^{4 - k} ).Therefore, the coefficient of ( x ) in the final expansion will come from two sources:1. The term in the original expansion where ( 3 - k = 1 ), because multiplying by 1 will give ( x^1 ).2. The term in the original expansion where ( 4 - k = 1 ), because multiplying by ( -x ) will give ( x^1 ).So, let's find the values of ( k ) for each case.First case: ( 3 - k = 1 ) implies ( k = 2 ). The coefficient here is ( (-1)^2 binom{6}{2} ).Second case: ( 4 - k = 1 ) implies ( k = 3 ). The coefficient here is ( (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} ), but remember we also have a factor of -1 from the ( -x ) term, so the total coefficient contribution will be ( (-1) times (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} ).Let me compute these.First, ( (-1)^2 binom{6}{2} ). ( (-1)^2 = 1 ), and ( binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 ). So, that's 15.Second, ( (-1) times (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} ). Let's compute step by step. ( (-1)^3 = -1 ), so ( (-1) times (-1) = 1 ). Then, ( binom{6}{3} = frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 ). So, that's 20.Now, adding these two contributions together: 15 + 20 = 35.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. When multiplying by ( -x ), the term is ( -x times ) the term from the expansion. So, the coefficient is ( -1 times ) the coefficient from ( x^{4 - k} ). So, in the second case, the coefficient is ( -1 times (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} ). Let me compute that again.( (-1)^3 = -1 ), so ( -1 times (-1) = 1 ), and ( binom{6}{3} = 20 ). So, 1 * 20 = 20. Then, adding the first contribution, which was 15, gives 15 + 20 = 35.So, the coefficient of ( x ) is 35, which is option A.Wait, but hold on again. Let me think if I considered all the signs correctly. The original expansion has ( (-1)^k ) in each term. So, when I take the term with ( k=2 ), it's ( (-1)^2 binom{6}{2} = 15 ), correct. Then, when I take the term with ( k=3 ), it's ( (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} = -20 ). But then, when I multiply by ( -x ), that's an additional factor of -1, so the total contribution is ( -1 times (-20) = 20 ). So, 15 + 20 = 35. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as distributing ( (1 - x) ) over the expansion. So, ( (1 - x) times text{expansion} = text{expansion} - x times text{expansion} ). So, the coefficient of ( x ) in the first part (expansion) is the coefficient of ( x ) in the original expansion, and the coefficient of ( x ) in the second part is the coefficient of ( x^0 ) in the original expansion, multiplied by -1.Wait, that might be another way to look at it. Let me try that.So, if I denote ( E = left( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ), then ( (1 - x)E = E - xE ).Therefore, the coefficient of ( x ) in ( (1 - x)E ) is equal to the coefficient of ( x ) in ( E ) minus the coefficient of ( x^0 ) in ( E ).So, let's compute the coefficient of ( x ) in ( E ) and the coefficient of ( x^0 ) in ( E ).From earlier, each term in ( E ) is ( (-1)^k binom{6}{k} x^{3 - k} ). So, to find the coefficient of ( x ), set ( 3 - k = 1 ), so ( k = 2 ). The coefficient is ( (-1)^2 binom{6}{2} = 15 ).To find the coefficient of ( x^0 ), set ( 3 - k = 0 ), so ( k = 3 ). The coefficient is ( (-1)^3 binom{6}{3} = -20 ).Therefore, the coefficient of ( x ) in ( (1 - x)E ) is ( 15 - (-20) = 15 + 20 = 35 ). So, that confirms the earlier result.Hmm, so the coefficient is 35, which is option A. But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are A:35, B:5, C:-15, D:-20. So, 35 is an option, so that must be the answer.Wait, but just to make sure, let me see if I made any miscalculations.First, computing ( binom{6}{2} ): 6 choose 2 is 15, correct.( binom{6}{3} ): 6 choose 3 is 20, correct.Signs: For ( k=2 ), ( (-1)^2 = 1 ), so 15.For ( k=3 ), ( (-1)^3 = -1 ), so -20. But since we're subtracting ( xE ), it's -1 times that, so -1*(-20)=20.Adding 15 and 20 gives 35.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion to check.But that might be time-consuming, but let me try a few terms.The expansion of ( left( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ) is:( binom{6}{0} (sqrt{x})^6 (-1/sqrt{x})^0 = 1 * x^3 * 1 = x^3 ).( binom{6}{1} (sqrt{x})^5 (-1/sqrt{x})^1 = 6 * x^{5/2} * (-1/sqrt{x}) = 6 * (-1) * x^{5/2 - 1/2} = -6x^2 ).( binom{6}{2} (sqrt{x})^4 (-1/sqrt{x})^2 = 15 * x^2 * (1/x) = 15x^{2 - 1} = 15x ).( binom{6}{3} (sqrt{x})^3 (-1/sqrt{x})^3 = 20 * x^{3/2} * (-1)^3 x^{-3/2} = 20*(-1)*x^{0} = -20 ).( binom{6}{4} (sqrt{x})^2 (-1/sqrt{x})^4 = 15 * x * (1/x^2) = 15x^{-1} ).( binom{6}{5} (sqrt{x})^1 (-1/sqrt{x})^5 = 6 * sqrt{x} * (-1)^5 x^{-5/2} = 6*(-1)*x^{-2} = -6x^{-2} ).( binom{6}{6} (sqrt{x})^0 (-1/sqrt{x})^6 = 1 * 1 * x^{-3} = x^{-3} ).So, putting it all together:( x^3 - 6x^2 + 15x - 20 + 15x^{-1} - 6x^{-2} + x^{-3} ).Now, multiply this by ( (1 - x) ):First, multiply by 1: ( x^3 - 6x^2 + 15x - 20 + 15x^{-1} - 6x^{-2} + x^{-3} ).Then, multiply by -x: ( -x^4 + 6x^3 - 15x^2 + 20x - 15x^{0} + 6x^{-1} - x^{-2} ).Now, add these two results together:Let's list all the terms:From the first multiplication (by 1):- ( x^3 )- ( -6x^2 )- ( 15x )- ( -20 )- ( 15x^{-1} )- ( -6x^{-2} )- ( x^{-3} )From the second multiplication (by -x):- ( -x^4 )- ( 6x^3 )- ( -15x^2 )- ( 20x )- ( -15 )- ( 6x^{-1} )- ( -x^{-2} )Now, combine like terms:- ( x^4 ): Only from the second multiplication: ( -x^4 )- ( x^3 ): ( x^3 + 6x^3 = 7x^3 )- ( x^2 ): ( -6x^2 -15x^2 = -21x^2 )- ( x ): ( 15x + 20x = 35x )- Constants: ( -20 -15 = -35 )- ( x^{-1} ): ( 15x^{-1} + 6x^{-1} = 21x^{-1} )- ( x^{-2} ): ( -6x^{-2} -x^{-2} = -7x^{-2} )- ( x^{-3} ): ( x^{-3} )So, the expanded form is:( -x^4 + 7x^3 -21x^2 +35x -35 +21x^{-1} -7x^{-2} +x^{-3} ).Looking at this, the coefficient of ( x ) is indeed 35. So, that confirms it.Therefore, the answer is A:35.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Johnny travels a total of one hour to and from school.

Johnny takes a total of one hour for the round trip, jogging to school at 5 miles per hour and returning by bus at 25 miles per hour.Let’s denote the distance to the school as ( d ) miles.The time taken to jog to school is ( frac{d}{5} ) hours, and the time taken to return by bus is ( frac{d}{25} ) hours.Since the total time for both trips is 1 hour, I can set up the equation:[frac{d}{5} + frac{d}{25} = 1]To solve for ( d ), I'll find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 25:[frac{5d}{25} + frac{d}{25} = 1]Combining the fractions gives:[frac{6d}{25} = 1]Multiplying both sides by 25:[6d = 25]Finally, dividing both sides by 6:[d = frac{25}{6} approx 4.17 text{ miles}]So, the distance to the school is approximately 4.17 miles."},{"question":"Let x be the swimmer's speed in still water (km/h) and y be the speed of the river's current (km/h).

The swimmer encounters a river with strong currents, whirlpools, and underwater obstacles. When swimming downstream, his effective speed is (x + y) km/h, and when swimming upstream, it's (x - y) km/h. The problem states that the time spent swimming upstream is three times the time spent swimming downstream, and the distances traveled in both directions are equal.First, I need to set up the problem with the given information. Let's denote the distance traveled both upstream and downstream as D kilometers. When swimming downstream, the swimmer's effective speed is (x + y) km/h, so the time taken to swim downstream, which I'll call T_down, is D divided by (x + y). Similarly, when swimming upstream, the effective speed is (x - y) km/h, so the time taken to swim upstream, T_up, is D divided by (x - y).According to the problem, T_up is three times T_down. So, I can write the equation:T_up = 3 * T_downSubstituting the expressions for T_up and T_down, I get:D / (x - y) = 3 * (D / (x + y))Since the distances D are the same for both upstream and downstream, I can cancel D from both sides of the equation:1 / (x - y) = 3 / (x + y)Now, I need to solve for y. To do this, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:(x + y) = 3 * (x - y)Expanding the right side:x + y = 3x - 3yNow, I'll bring all terms to one side to solve for y:x + y - 3x + 3y = 0Combining like terms:-2x + 4y = 0Now, solving for y:4y = 2xy = (2x) / 4y = x / 2Given that x is 10 km/h, I can substitute:y = 10 / 2y = 5 km/hSo, the speed of the river's current is 5 km/h."},{"question":"Find the largest natural number consisting of distinct digits such that the product of its digits equals 2016.","answer":"Alright, so I need to find the largest natural number made up of distinct digits where the product of its digits equals 2016. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I should probably factorize 2016 to understand what digits I might be dealing with. Let me do that. 2016 divided by 2 is 1008, divided by 2 again is 504, and again by 2 is 252, and once more by 2 is 126. That's four 2s so far. Then, 126 divided by 2 is 63, which is odd. So, 2016 is 2^5 times something. Let's see, 63 is 7 times 9, and 9 is 3 squared. So, putting it all together, 2016 is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7. Okay, so the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7, with exponents 5, 2, and 1 respectively.Now, I need to find digits (from 0 to 9) that multiply together to give 2016, and all digits must be distinct. Also, since we're looking for the largest number, we should aim for the largest possible digits and arrange them in descending order.Let me think about how to combine these prime factors into single digits. The digits can be 1 through 9, and each can be used only once. So, I need to factor 2016 into distinct digits.Starting with the largest digit, which is 9. Let's see if 9 can be a part of the number. 9 is 3^2, which we have in our prime factors. So, if I include 9, that would account for the 3^2 part. Then, I still have 2^5 and 7 left.Next, 8 is a large digit. 8 is 2^3. If I include 8, that would take care of three of the five 2s. Then, I have 2^2 left. 7 is a prime number, so I need to include 7 as a digit.Now, let's see: 9, 8, and 7. The product so far is 9 * 8 * 7 = 504. But we need the total product to be 2016, so we need more factors. 2016 divided by 504 is 4. So, we need digits that multiply to 4, using the remaining prime factors, which are 2^2.But we need distinct digits, and we've already used 9, 8, and 7. So, let's see what digits we can use for 4. 4 itself is an option, but let's see if we can break it down into smaller digits to possibly get a larger number when arranged.4 can be 2 * 2, but we can't use 2 twice because digits must be distinct. Alternatively, 4 can be 4 * 1. So, adding 4 and 1 to our digits. So, now we have 9, 8, 7, 4, and 1.Let's check the product: 9 * 8 * 7 * 4 * 1 = 2016. Perfect, that works. But wait, can we get a larger number by using different digits?Let me think. Maybe instead of 4 and 1, can we use other digits? For example, 2 and 2, but that's not allowed because digits must be distinct. What about 2 and 3? But we already have 9, which is 3^2, so adding another 3 would conflict. Hmm.Alternatively, if I don't use 9, maybe I can use more smaller digits to get a larger number. Let's see. If I don't use 9, then I have to account for the 3^2 somewhere else. Maybe using two 3s, but again, digits must be distinct, so that's not possible. So, 9 seems necessary.Wait, another thought: instead of 9, 8, 7, 4, 1, maybe I can rearrange the factors differently. For example, 8 is 2^3, and 6 is 2 * 3. If I use 6 instead of 4 and 3, maybe that would allow more digits. Let's try.So, starting with 8 (2^3), 7, and 6 (2 * 3). Then, we have 2016 divided by (8 * 7 * 6) = 2016 / 336 = 6. So, we need another 6, but we can't use 6 twice. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe 8, 7, 3, and then what? 8 * 7 * 3 = 168. 2016 / 168 = 12. So, we need digits that multiply to 12, which could be 4 and 3, but we already have 3. Or 6 and 2. So, 6 and 2. So, digits would be 8, 7, 3, 6, 2, and 1 (since we need to account for the remaining 1). Let's check the product: 8 * 7 * 3 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 2016. Yes, that works.Now, arranging these digits in descending order: 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1. So, the number would be 876321.Wait, earlier I had 9, 8, 7, 4, 1, which gives 98741. But 876321 is a six-digit number, while 98741 is a five-digit number. So, 876321 is larger. Therefore, 876321 is the larger number.Is there a way to get a larger number than 876321? Let's see. Maybe using more digits? Let's try.If I use 9, 8, 7, 6, and then what? 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 3024, which is larger than 2016, so that's too much. So, we can't include 9, 8, 7, and 6 together.Alternatively, maybe 9, 8, 7, and then smaller digits. Let's see: 9 * 8 * 7 = 504. 2016 / 504 = 4. So, we need digits that multiply to 4, which could be 4 and 1, as before. So, digits would be 9, 8, 7, 4, 1, which is five digits, giving 98741, which is smaller than 876321.Alternatively, if I use 9, 8, 6, and then what? 9 * 8 * 6 = 432. 2016 / 432 = 4.666..., which is not an integer, so that doesn't work.What about 9, 7, 6, and then? 9 * 7 * 6 = 378. 2016 / 378 = 5.333..., not an integer.Alternatively, 8, 7, 6, 5... but 5 isn't a factor of 2016, since 2016 is divisible by 2, 3, and 7, but not by 5. So, 5 can't be part of the digits.Wait, but 5 is a digit, but since 2016 isn't divisible by 5, we can't include 5 in the digits because the product would then be divisible by 5, which it's not. So, 5 is out.Similarly, 0 can't be included because any number with 0 would make the product 0, which isn't 2016.So, back to the digits we have: 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1. That seems to be the best combination, giving us the number 876321.Let me double-check the product: 8 * 7 = 56, 56 * 6 = 336, 336 * 3 = 1008, 1008 * 2 = 2016, 2016 * 1 = 2016. Yes, that works.Is there a way to rearrange these digits to get a larger number? Well, arranging them in descending order gives the largest possible number, so 876321 is indeed the largest.Wait, another thought: what if I use 9 instead of 8? Let's see: 9, 7, 6, and then what? 9 * 7 * 6 = 378. 2016 / 378 = 5.333..., which isn't an integer. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, 9, 8, 7, and then 4 and 1, as before, giving 98741, which is smaller than 876321.So, I think 876321 is the largest number possible with distinct digits where the product of the digits is 2016.Just to be thorough, let's see if there's another combination. Maybe using 8, 7, 6, 4, and something else. 8 * 7 * 6 * 4 = 1344. 2016 / 1344 = 1.5, which isn't an integer, so that doesn't work.Alternatively, 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, which we've already established works and gives 876321.I think that's the answer."},{"question":"On a circle, there are 2018 points. Each of these points is labeled with an integer such that each number is greater than the sum of the two numbers immediately preceding it in a clockwise direction.Determine the maximum possible number of positive numbers among the 2018 numbers.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about 2018 points on a circle, each labeled with an integer. The condition is that each number is greater than the sum of the two numbers immediately preceding it in a clockwise direction. I need to figure out the maximum number of positive numbers possible among these 2018 points.Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem better. We have a circle with 2018 points, each labeled with an integer. Let's denote these points as ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2017} ) arranged in a clockwise manner. The condition given is that for each point ( a_k ), it must satisfy:[a_k > a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}]where the indices are taken modulo 2018 because it's a circle. So, ( a_{-1} ) would be ( a_{2017} ), ( a_{-2} ) would be ( a_{2016} ), and so on.My goal is to maximize the number of positive integers among these 2018 points. So, I need to figure out how many of these ( a_k ) can be positive while still satisfying the given condition.Let me think about the implications of the condition ( a_k > a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} ). If I have two consecutive positive numbers, say ( a_{k-2} ) and ( a_{k-1} ), then ( a_k ) must be greater than their sum. Since both ( a_{k-2} ) and ( a_{k-1} ) are positive, their sum is positive, so ( a_k ) must be positive as well. But wait, that would mean ( a_k ) is positive, and then moving forward, ( a_{k+1} ) would have to be greater than ( a_k + a_{k-1} ), which are both positive, so ( a_{k+1} ) would also have to be positive. This seems like it could create a chain reaction where all subsequent numbers have to be positive, which might not be possible on a circle because it would create an infinite increasing sequence, which isn't feasible.So, maybe having two consecutive positive numbers isn't allowed? Or at least, it's not possible to have too many consecutive positive numbers. Let me test this idea.Suppose we have two consecutive positive numbers, ( a_{k-1} ) and ( a_k ). Then, ( a_{k+1} > a_k + a_{k-1} ), which is positive. Then ( a_{k+2} > a_{k+1} + a_k ), which is also positive, and so on. This would mean that all subsequent numbers are positive, which would require all numbers to be positive, but that can't be because on a circle, this would create a cycle where each number is larger than the previous, which isn't possible. So, perhaps having two consecutive positive numbers is not allowed.Wait, but the problem says each number is greater than the sum of the two preceding numbers. So, if two preceding numbers are positive, the next one has to be positive as well. So, if I have two positive numbers in a row, the next one must be positive, and so on. So, that would force all numbers to be positive, which is impossible because on a circle, you can't have an increasing sequence indefinitely. Therefore, having two consecutive positive numbers is not allowed. So, that means positive numbers must be separated by at least one negative number.So, if I can't have two positive numbers in a row, the maximum number of positive numbers would be roughly half of 2018, which is 1009. But wait, the problem is on a circle, so if I alternate positive and negative numbers, I might end up with a contradiction because the last number would have to be positive, and then the first number would have to be positive as well, which might conflict with the condition.Let me think about that. Suppose I try to alternate positive and negative numbers. Let's say ( a_0 ) is positive, ( a_1 ) is negative, ( a_2 ) is positive, ( a_3 ) is negative, and so on. Then, for each positive ( a_k ), the next number ( a_{k+1} ) is negative, and the one after that ( a_{k+2} ) is positive. Now, according to the condition, ( a_{k+2} > a_{k+1} + a_k ). Since ( a_{k+1} ) is negative and ( a_k ) is positive, their sum could be positive or negative depending on their magnitudes.But if I want ( a_{k+2} ) to be positive, then ( a_{k+1} + a_k ) must be less than ( a_{k+2} ). Since ( a_{k+1} ) is negative, ( a_{k+1} + a_k ) is less than ( a_k ). So, ( a_{k+2} ) just needs to be greater than ( a_{k+1} + a_k ), which is less than ( a_k ). So, as long as ( a_{k+2} ) is positive and greater than ( a_{k+1} + a_k ), it's okay.But wait, let's consider the entire circle. If I alternate positive and negative numbers, starting with positive, then the last number ( a_{2017} ) would be negative if 2018 is even, right? Because 2018 divided by 2 is 1009, so the last number would be negative. Then, ( a_0 ) is positive, and ( a_{2017} ) is negative. So, ( a_1 ) must be greater than ( a_0 + a_{2017} ). Since ( a_0 ) is positive and ( a_{2017} ) is negative, their sum could be positive or negative.If ( a_0 + a_{2017} ) is positive, then ( a_1 ) must be greater than that positive number, which would require ( a_1 ) to be positive. But ( a_1 ) is supposed to be negative in our alternating pattern. That's a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that we can alternate positive and negative numbers without any issues is flawed.So, maybe alternating positive and negative numbers isn't possible because it leads to a contradiction at the end of the circle. Therefore, we can't have exactly half of the numbers positive and half negative in an alternating fashion.Hmm, so perhaps the maximum number of positive numbers is less than 1009. Let's think about how to arrange the numbers so that we maximize the number of positives without violating the condition.If we can't have two positives in a row, then the maximum number of positives would be 1009, but as we saw, that leads to a contradiction on the circle. So, maybe the maximum is 1008.Let me try to construct such an arrangement. Suppose I have 1008 positive numbers and 1010 negative numbers. Let's arrange them in such a way that between every two positive numbers, there are at least two negative numbers. Wait, but that might not be necessary. Let me think.If I have a positive number, then the next number must be negative. Then, the number after that can be positive or negative. If I make it negative, then the next number can be positive, but let's see.Wait, let's try to arrange it so that after a positive number, we have two negative numbers. So, the pattern would be positive, negative, negative, positive, negative, negative, and so on. Let's see if that works.So, starting with ( a_0 ) positive, ( a_1 ) negative, ( a_2 ) negative, ( a_3 ) positive, ( a_4 ) negative, ( a_5 ) negative, etc. Let's check the conditions.For ( a_3 ), we have ( a_3 > a_2 + a_1 ). Since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both negative, their sum is negative, so ( a_3 ) just needs to be greater than a negative number, which is possible if ( a_3 ) is positive.Similarly, for ( a_4 ), ( a_4 > a_3 + a_2 ). ( a_3 ) is positive, ( a_2 ) is negative. So, ( a_3 + a_2 ) could be positive or negative depending on their magnitudes. If ( a_3 ) is large enough, ( a_3 + a_2 ) could still be positive, so ( a_4 ) would have to be greater than that, which would require ( a_4 ) to be positive. But in our pattern, ( a_4 ) is supposed to be negative. So, that's a problem.Therefore, maybe having two negatives after a positive isn't sufficient. Perhaps we need more negatives between positives.Alternatively, maybe we can have a positive number followed by a negative number, then a positive number, but that would require two positives separated by one negative, which might not work because of the condition.Wait, let's try that. Suppose we have positive, negative, positive, negative, etc. So, ( a_0 ) positive, ( a_1 ) negative, ( a_2 ) positive, ( a_3 ) negative, and so on.Now, let's check the condition for ( a_2 ). ( a_2 > a_1 + a_0 ). ( a_0 ) is positive, ( a_1 ) is negative. So, ( a_1 + a_0 ) could be positive or negative. If ( a_0 ) is larger in magnitude than ( a_1 ), then ( a_1 + a_0 ) is positive, so ( a_2 ) must be greater than that positive number, which is possible if ( a_2 ) is positive.Similarly, for ( a_3 ), ( a_3 > a_2 + a_1 ). ( a_2 ) is positive, ( a_1 ) is negative. Again, ( a_2 + a_1 ) could be positive or negative. If ( a_2 ) is larger in magnitude than ( a_1 ), then ( a_2 + a_1 ) is positive, so ( a_3 ) must be greater than that, which would require ( a_3 ) to be positive, but in our pattern, ( a_3 ) is negative. So, that's a contradiction.Therefore, alternating positive and negative numbers in this way doesn't work either because it forces some negative numbers to be positive, which contradicts the pattern.Hmm, so maybe the maximum number of positive numbers is less than 1009, perhaps 1008. Let me try to construct an arrangement with 1008 positive numbers.Suppose I have 1008 positive numbers and 1010 negative numbers. Let's arrange them such that between every two positive numbers, there are at least two negative numbers. So, the pattern would be positive, negative, negative, positive, negative, negative, etc.Let's check the conditions. Starting with ( a_0 ) positive, ( a_1 ) negative, ( a_2 ) negative, ( a_3 ) positive, ( a_4 ) negative, ( a_5 ) negative, and so on.For ( a_3 ), ( a_3 > a_2 + a_1 ). Both ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are negative, so their sum is negative. Therefore, ( a_3 ) just needs to be greater than a negative number, which is possible if ( a_3 ) is positive.For ( a_4 ), ( a_4 > a_3 + a_2 ). ( a_3 ) is positive, ( a_2 ) is negative. So, ( a_3 + a_2 ) could be positive or negative. If ( a_3 ) is large enough, ( a_3 + a_2 ) could still be positive, so ( a_4 ) would have to be greater than that, which would require ( a_4 ) to be positive. But in our pattern, ( a_4 ) is negative. So, that's a problem.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the magnitudes of the negative numbers to ensure that ( a_3 + a_2 ) is negative, so that ( a_4 ) can be negative and still satisfy ( a_4 > a_3 + a_2 ).Let me think about that. If ( a_3 ) is positive and ( a_2 ) is negative, to make ( a_3 + a_2 ) negative, ( |a_2| ) must be greater than ( a_3 ). So, if I choose ( a_2 ) to be a large negative number, larger in magnitude than ( a_3 ), then ( a_3 + a_2 ) would be negative. Then, ( a_4 ) just needs to be greater than that negative number, which it can be if ( a_4 ) is negative but not too negative.Wait, but ( a_4 ) is supposed to be negative, so it's greater than ( a_3 + a_2 ), which is also negative. So, as long as ( a_4 ) is greater than ( a_3 + a_2 ), which is a negative number, ( a_4 ) can be negative. For example, if ( a_3 + a_2 = -5 ), then ( a_4 ) just needs to be greater than -5, which it can be if ( a_4 = -4 ), for instance.So, let's try to formalize this. Let me assign specific values to see if this works.Let me set ( a_0 = 1 ) (positive). Then, ( a_1 ) must be negative. Let's set ( a_1 = -M ), where ( M ) is a large positive integer. Then, ( a_2 ) must be negative as well. Let's set ( a_2 = -N ), where ( N ) is another large positive integer.Now, ( a_3 ) must satisfy ( a_3 > a_2 + a_1 = (-N) + (-M) = -(M + N) ). So, ( a_3 ) just needs to be greater than ( -(M + N) ). Since ( a_3 ) is positive, this is automatically satisfied if ( a_3 ) is positive. Let's set ( a_3 = 1 ).Next, ( a_4 ) must satisfy ( a_4 > a_3 + a_2 = 1 + (-N) = 1 - N ). Since ( N ) is large, ( 1 - N ) is a large negative number. Therefore, ( a_4 ) just needs to be greater than a large negative number, which it can be if ( a_4 ) is negative but not too negative. Let's set ( a_4 = -K ), where ( K ) is a positive integer such that ( -K > 1 - N ). Since ( N ) is large, ( 1 - N ) is very negative, so ( -K ) just needs to be greater than that, which is easily satisfied by choosing ( K ) appropriately.Continuing this pattern, ( a_5 ) must satisfy ( a_5 > a_4 + a_3 = (-K) + 1 = 1 - K ). Again, since ( K ) is positive, ( 1 - K ) is negative, so ( a_5 ) just needs to be greater than that, which it can be if ( a_5 ) is negative. Let's set ( a_5 = -L ), where ( L ) is another positive integer.This seems to work. By choosing the negative numbers to be sufficiently large in magnitude, we can ensure that the sum of two consecutive negative numbers is very negative, allowing the next positive number to be just 1, and then the following negative number can be set to a value that satisfies the condition without being too negative.So, in this arrangement, we have a repeating pattern of positive, negative, negative, positive, negative, negative, etc. Each positive number is followed by two negative numbers, which are chosen to be large enough in magnitude to ensure that the next positive number can be small (like 1) and still satisfy the condition.Given that 2018 is even, and we're placing a positive number every three positions (positive, negative, negative), the number of positive numbers would be ( frac{2018}{3} ), but since 2018 isn't divisible by 3, we need to adjust.Wait, actually, in our pattern, every positive number is followed by two negative numbers, so the total number of positive numbers would be ( frac{2018}{3} ), but since we can't have a fraction, we take the floor. However, 2018 divided by 3 is approximately 672.666, so 672 positive numbers. But that's much less than 1008. So, perhaps my initial assumption about the pattern is too restrictive.Wait, maybe I can have a different pattern where after a positive number, there's only one negative number before the next positive number, but ensuring that the condition is satisfied.Let me try that. Suppose the pattern is positive, negative, positive, negative, etc., but ensuring that the negative numbers are large enough in magnitude to make the sum of two negatives negative, allowing the next positive to be small.Wait, but earlier, I saw that this leads to a contradiction because the last number would have to be positive, conflicting with the first number. Maybe I need to adjust the pattern slightly.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of positive numbers is 1008, and I need to find a way to arrange them such that no two are adjacent and the conditions are satisfied.Let me think about arranging 1008 positive numbers and 1010 negative numbers. Since 2018 is even, 1008 is exactly half minus one. So, perhaps arranging them such that between every two positive numbers, there are two negative numbers, but since 1008 * 3 = 3024, which is more than 2018, that doesn't quite fit.Wait, maybe I need to distribute the positive numbers such that they are spaced out with at least one negative number between them, but not necessarily two. Let me try that.If I have 1008 positive numbers, each separated by at least one negative number, then the total number of negative numbers needed would be at least 1008, but since we have 1010 negative numbers, that's possible. So, the pattern would be positive, negative, positive, negative, etc., but with two extra negative numbers somewhere.But as I saw earlier, this leads to a contradiction because the last number would have to be positive, conflicting with the first number. So, maybe I need to adjust the pattern to have some places where there are two negative numbers between positives.Wait, perhaps if I have 1008 positive numbers, each separated by one negative number, except for two places where there are two negative numbers. That way, the total number of negative numbers would be 1008 + 2 = 1010, which matches.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose we have 1008 positive numbers, each separated by one negative number, except for two places where there are two negative numbers. So, the pattern would be mostly positive, negative, positive, negative, etc., but with two instances of positive, negative, negative, positive.This way, the total number of negative numbers would be 1008 + 2 = 1010, which is correct. Now, let's check if this arrangement satisfies the condition.Starting with ( a_0 ) positive, ( a_1 ) negative, ( a_2 ) positive, ( a_3 ) negative, and so on. At the two places where there are two negative numbers, say between ( a_k ) and ( a_{k+2} ), we have ( a_{k+1} ) and ( a_{k+2} ) both negative.Let's check the condition for ( a_{k+2} ). ( a_{k+2} > a_{k+1} + a_k ). Since ( a_k ) is positive and ( a_{k+1} ) is negative, ( a_{k+1} + a_k ) could be positive or negative. If ( a_k ) is large enough, ( a_{k+1} + a_k ) could still be positive, so ( a_{k+2} ) would have to be greater than that positive number, which would require ( a_{k+2} ) to be positive. But in our pattern, ( a_{k+2} ) is negative, which is a contradiction.Therefore, this arrangement doesn't work either. So, perhaps having two negative numbers between positives isn't sufficient to satisfy the condition unless the negative numbers are chosen to be large enough in magnitude.Wait, maybe if the negative numbers are chosen to be very large in magnitude, then the sum ( a_{k+1} + a_k ) would be negative, allowing ( a_{k+2} ) to be negative and still satisfy ( a_{k+2} > a_{k+1} + a_k ).Let me try that. Suppose ( a_k ) is positive, ( a_{k+1} ) is a large negative number, say ( -M ), and ( a_{k+2} ) is another large negative number, say ( -N ). Then, ( a_{k+2} > a_{k+1} + a_k ) becomes ( -N > -M + a_k ). Rearranging, ( -N + M > a_k ). Since ( a_k ) is positive, this implies ( M - N > a_k ). So, if ( M ) is much larger than ( N ), this can be satisfied.But then, moving forward, ( a_{k+3} ) must satisfy ( a_{k+3} > a_{k+2} + a_{k+1} = (-N) + (-M) = -(M + N) ). So, ( a_{k+3} ) just needs to be greater than ( -(M + N) ), which it can be if ( a_{k+3} ) is positive.So, in this case, after two negative numbers, we can have a positive number again. Therefore, the pattern could be positive, negative, negative, positive, negative, negative, etc., with each positive number followed by two negative numbers.Given that 2018 divided by 3 is approximately 672.666, we can fit 672 such triplets, which would account for 672 * 3 = 2016 numbers, leaving two numbers. So, we can have 672 positive numbers and 672 * 2 = 1344 negative numbers, plus two more numbers. To reach 1008 positive numbers, we need 1008 - 672 = 336 more positive numbers. Hmm, this approach isn't getting me to 1008 positive numbers.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since we can't have two positive numbers in a row, the maximum number of positive numbers is at most 1009. But as we saw earlier, having 1009 positive numbers leads to a contradiction on the circle. Therefore, the maximum must be 1008.To confirm this, let's try to construct an arrangement with 1008 positive numbers and 1010 negative numbers. Let's arrange them such that every positive number is followed by two negative numbers, except for one place where it's followed by one negative number. This way, the total number of negative numbers would be 1008 * 2 + 1 = 2017, which is one less than 2018. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up.Wait, maybe I need to have 1008 positive numbers, each followed by two negative numbers, which would account for 1008 * 3 = 3024 positions, which is more than 2018. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, perhaps I can have 1008 positive numbers, each separated by at least one negative number, but with some places having two negative numbers to prevent the contradiction at the end.Wait, let me try to think of it as a graph. Each positive number must be separated by at least one negative number. So, the maximum number of positive numbers is floor(2018 / 2) = 1009, but as we saw, that leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the maximum must be 1008.I think the key here is that on a circle, having 1009 positive numbers would require that the last number is positive, which would conflict with the first number being positive, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers is 1008.To summarize, the maximum number of positive numbers among the 2018 points is 1008."},{"question":"x_1 and x_2 are two real roots of the equation 2x^2-3x+m=0, and 8x_1-2x_2=7, then m=boxed{1}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( m ) in the quadratic equation ( 2x^2 - 3x + m = 0 ). The problem also gives me another equation involving the roots of this quadratic: ( 8x_1 - 2x_2 = 7 ). Hmm, let's see how I can tackle this.First, I remember that for any quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( x_1 + x_2 ) is equal to ( -frac{b}{a} ), and the product of the roots ( x_1 cdot x_2 ) is equal to ( frac{c}{a} ). So in this case, since the equation is ( 2x^2 - 3x + m = 0 ), the sum of the roots should be ( frac{3}{2} ) because ( -frac{-3}{2} = frac{3}{2} ). And the product of the roots would be ( frac{m}{2} ).Alright, so I can write down these two equations:1. ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{3}{2} )  (Equation 1)2. ( 8x_1 - 2x_2 = 7 )       (Equation 2)Now, I need to solve these two equations to find the values of ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Once I have those, I can use the product of the roots to find ( m ).Let me start by simplifying Equation 2. It might help to make the coefficients smaller so it's easier to work with. If I divide the entire equation by 2, I get:( 4x_1 - x_2 = frac{7}{2} )  (Equation 2 simplified)So now, Equation 1 is ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{3}{2} ), and Equation 2 is ( 4x_1 - x_2 = frac{7}{2} ).Hmm, maybe I can add these two equations together to eliminate ( x_2 ). Let me try that.Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:( (x_1 + x_2) + (4x_1 - x_2) = frac{3}{2} + frac{7}{2} )Simplifying the left side:( x_1 + x_2 + 4x_1 - x_2 = 5x_1 )And the right side:( frac{3}{2} + frac{7}{2} = frac{10}{2} = 5 )So, ( 5x_1 = 5 ), which means ( x_1 = 1 ).Now that I have ( x_1 = 1 ), I can substitute this back into Equation 1 to find ( x_2 ).Substituting into Equation 1:( 1 + x_2 = frac{3}{2} )Subtracting 1 from both sides:( x_2 = frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{1}{2} )So, the roots are ( x_1 = 1 ) and ( x_2 = frac{1}{2} ).Now, I need to find ( m ). Remember, the product of the roots ( x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{m}{2} ). Let's compute that.Calculating the product:( x_1 cdot x_2 = 1 times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} )So, ( frac{m}{2} = frac{1}{2} ). To find ( m ), I can multiply both sides by 2:( m = 1 )Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning, I used Vieta's formulas correctly to get the sum and product of the roots. Then, I set up the two equations and solved them by elimination, which gave me ( x_1 = 1 ) and ( x_2 = frac{1}{2} ). Plugging these back into the product equation, I found ( m = 1 ). It all seems to check out.Just to be thorough, I'll plug ( x_1 = 1 ) and ( x_2 = frac{1}{2} ) back into the original quadratic equation to see if they satisfy it.First, for ( x = 1 ):( 2(1)^2 - 3(1) + m = 2 - 3 + m = -1 + m )Since ( x = 1 ) is a root, this should equal zero:( -1 + m = 0 ) implies ( m = 1 ). That matches what I found earlier.Now, for ( x = frac{1}{2} ):( 2left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 3left(frac{1}{2}right) + m = 2left(frac{1}{4}right) - frac{3}{2} + m = frac{1}{2} - frac{3}{2} + m = -1 + m )Again, since ( x = frac{1}{2} ) is a root, this should equal zero:( -1 + m = 0 ) implies ( m = 1 ). Perfect, both roots confirm that ( m = 1 ).So, I'm confident that the value of ( m ) is indeed 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_{n}} with the first term a_{1}=2, and the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_{n}, satisfying S_{n}+S_{n-1}=left(n+1right)left(n+2right) for ngeqslant 2.<br/>(1) Find S_{21};<br/>(2) Let {c_n}=frac{{{{({-1})}^n}n}}{{{S_n}}}, determine the maximum term of the sequence {c_{n}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence {a_n} where the first term a₁ is 2. The sum of the first n terms is S_n, and it's given that for n ≥ 2, S_n + S_{n-1} = (n+1)(n+2). There are two parts: first, find S_{21}, and second, define c_n as (-1)^n * n / S_n and find the maximum term of {c_n}.Alright, let's start with part (1). I need to find S_{21}. The given condition is S_n + S_{n-1} = (n+1)(n+2). Hmm, so for each n ≥ 2, the sum of the nth and (n-1)th partial sums equals (n+1)(n+2). That seems like a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for S_n.First, let me write down the given equation:S_n + S_{n-1} = (n+1)(n+2) for n ≥ 2.I wonder if I can express this as a recurrence relation. Let me consider the equation for n+1:S_{n+1} + S_n = (n+2)(n+3).Now, if I subtract the original equation from this new one, I get:(S_{n+1} + S_n) - (S_n + S_{n-1}) = (n+2)(n+3) - (n+1)(n+2).Simplifying the left side: S_{n+1} - S_{n-1}.On the right side: (n+2)(n+3 - n -1) = (n+2)(2) = 2n + 4.So, S_{n+1} - S_{n-1} = 2n + 4.Hmm, that's interesting. Since S_{n+1} - S_{n-1} is equal to a_n + a_{n+1}, because S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} and S_{n-1} = S_n - a_n. So, S_{n+1} - S_{n-1} = a_{n+1} + a_n.Therefore, a_{n+1} + a_n = 2n + 4 for n ≥ 2.Wait, so this gives me a relation between consecutive terms a_n and a_{n+1}. Maybe I can use this to find a general formula for a_n or S_n.Let me try to compute some terms to see if I can find a pattern.We know a₁ = 2.To find a₂, let's use n=2 in the equation a_{n+1} + a_n = 2n + 4.For n=2: a₃ + a₂ = 2*2 + 4 = 8.But I don't know a₃ yet. Maybe I can find S₂.Wait, from the original equation, for n=2: S₂ + S₁ = (2+1)(2+2) = 3*4 = 12.We know S₁ = a₁ = 2, so S₂ = 12 - S₁ = 12 - 2 = 10.Therefore, S₂ = 10, which is a₁ + a₂ = 2 + a₂ = 10, so a₂ = 8.Okay, so a₂ = 8.Now, for n=2: a₃ + a₂ = 8, so a₃ = 8 - a₂ = 8 - 8 = 0? Wait, that can't be right because a₃ would be zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no, let me check. For n=2, a_{n+1} + a_n = 2n + 4. So, a₃ + a₂ = 8. Since a₂ is 8, then a₃ is 0. Hmm, that seems odd, but maybe it's correct.Let me check S₃. Using the original equation for n=3: S₃ + S₂ = (3+1)(3+2) = 4*5 = 20.We know S₂ = 10, so S₃ = 20 - 10 = 10.But S₃ = S₂ + a₃ = 10 + a₃ = 10, so a₃ = 0. Okay, that's consistent.Now, for n=3: a₄ + a₃ = 2*3 + 4 = 10.Since a₃ = 0, a₄ = 10.Then, S₄ = S₃ + a₄ = 10 + 10 = 20.Check with the original equation for n=4: S₄ + S₃ = (4+1)(4+2) = 5*6 = 30.Indeed, 20 + 10 = 30. Good.Similarly, for n=4: a₅ + a₄ = 2*4 + 4 = 12.Since a₄ = 10, a₅ = 12 - 10 = 2.Then, S₅ = S₄ + a₅ = 20 + 2 = 22.Check for n=5: S₅ + S₄ = (5+1)(5+2) = 6*7 = 42.22 + 20 = 42. Correct.Continuing, for n=5: a₆ + a₅ = 2*5 + 4 = 14.a₅ = 2, so a₆ = 14 - 2 = 12.S₆ = S₅ + a₆ = 22 + 12 = 34.Check n=6: S₆ + S₅ = (6+1)(6+2) = 7*8 = 56.34 + 22 = 56. Correct.Hmm, so the pattern seems to be that the terms alternate between increasing and decreasing? Let's see:a₁=2, a₂=8, a₃=0, a₄=10, a₅=2, a₆=12, a₇=?Wait, let's compute a₇.For n=6: a₇ + a₆ = 2*6 + 4 = 16.a₆=12, so a₇=16 - 12=4.Then S₇ = S₆ + a₇ = 34 + 4 = 38.Check n=7: S₇ + S₆ = (7+1)(7+2)=8*9=72.38 + 34=72. Correct.Similarly, for n=7: a₈ + a₇=2*7 +4=18.a₇=4, so a₈=18 -4=14.S₈=38 +14=52.Check n=8: S₈ + S₇= (8+1)(8+2)=9*10=90.52 +38=90. Correct.Hmm, so the terms a_n are: 2,8,0,10,2,12,4,14,...It seems like for even n, a_n increases by 2 each time: a₂=8, a₄=10, a₆=12, a₈=14,...And for odd n starting from a₃, it's 0,2,4,... increasing by 2 each time.Wait, a₁=2, a₃=0, a₅=2, a₇=4, a₉=6,...So, for odd n: a_{2k+1}=2k-2, starting from k=1: a₃=0, a₅=2, a₇=4,...And for even n: a_{2k}=8 + 2(k-1)=2k+6, starting from k=1: a₂=8, a₄=10, a₆=12, etc.Wait, let's check:For even n=2k: a_{2k}=2k +6.So, for k=1: a₂=8, correct.k=2: a₄=10, correct.k=3: a₆=12, correct.Similarly, for odd n=2k+1: a_{2k+1}=2k -2.For k=1: a₃=0, correct.k=2: a₅=2, correct.k=3: a₇=4, correct.So, that seems to be the pattern.Therefore, we can express a_n as:If n is even, say n=2k, then a_n=2k +6.If n is odd, say n=2k+1, then a_n=2k -2.So, now, to find S_n, which is the sum of the first n terms.Given that, perhaps we can find a formula for S_n.Alternatively, since we have a recurrence relation for S_n, maybe we can solve it.We have S_n + S_{n-1} = (n+1)(n+2).This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it using standard techniques.First, let's write the recurrence:S_n + S_{n-1} = (n+1)(n+2).This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is S_n + S_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r +1=0, so r=-1. So the homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = A(-1)^n.For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is quadratic, let's assume a particular solution of the form S_n^{(p)} = an² + bn + c.Plugging into the recurrence:(an² + bn + c) + (a(n-1)² + b(n-1) + c) = (n+1)(n+2).Simplify the left side:an² + bn + c + a(n² - 2n +1) + b(n -1) + c =an² + bn + c + an² - 2an + a + bn - b + c =2an² + (2b - 2a)n + (2c + a - b).Right side: (n+1)(n+2) = n² + 3n + 2.So, equate coefficients:2a = 1 => a=1/2.2b - 2a = 3 => 2b -1 =3 => 2b=4 => b=2.2c + a - b = 2 => 2c + 1/2 -2=2 => 2c - 3/2=2 => 2c=7/2 => c=7/4.Therefore, the particular solution is S_n^{(p)} = (1/2)n² + 2n + 7/4.Thus, the general solution is S_n = S_n^{(h)} + S_n^{(p)} = A(-1)^n + (1/2)n² + 2n + 7/4.Now, we need to find A using the initial condition.Wait, we know S₁ = a₁ =2.So, plug n=1 into the general solution:S₁ = A(-1)^1 + (1/2)(1)^2 + 2(1) + 7/4 = -A + 1/2 + 2 + 7/4.Compute constants: 1/2 + 2 = 5/2, 5/2 +7/4= (10/4 +7/4)=17/4.So, S₁ = -A +17/4 =2.Thus, -A +17/4=2 => -A=2 -17/4= (8/4 -17/4)= -9/4 => A=9/4.Therefore, the general solution is S_n= (9/4)(-1)^n + (1/2)n² + 2n +7/4.Simplify:S_n= (1/2)n² + 2n +7/4 + (9/4)(-1)^n.We can write it as:S_n= (1/2)n² + 2n + (7/4 + (9/4)(-1)^n).Alternatively, factor out 1/4:S_n= (1/2)n² + 2n + (7 +9(-1)^n)/4.Hmm, let me check this formula with the known values.For n=1: S₁= (1/2)(1) + 2(1) + (7 +9(-1))/4= 1/2 +2 + (7 -9)/4= 5/2 + (-2)/4=5/2 -1/2=4/2=2. Correct.For n=2: S₂= (1/2)(4) + 2(2) + (7 +9(1))/4= 2 +4 +16/4=6 +4=10. Correct.For n=3: S₃= (1/2)(9) + 2(3) + (7 +9(-1))/4=4.5 +6 + (-2)/4=10.5 -0.5=10. Correct.For n=4: S₄= (1/2)(16) + 2(4) + (7 +9(1))/4=8 +8 +16/4=16 +4=20. Correct.Good, so the formula seems correct.Therefore, S_n= (1/2)n² + 2n + (7 +9(-1)^n)/4.Now, we need to compute S_{21}.Let me compute S_{21}= (1/2)(21)^2 + 2(21) + (7 +9(-1)^{21})/4.First, compute each term:(1/2)(21)^2= (1/2)(441)=220.5.2(21)=42.(7 +9(-1)^{21})/4= (7 -9)/4= (-2)/4= -0.5.So, adding them up: 220.5 +42 -0.5=220.5 +41.5=262.Therefore, S_{21}=262.Wait, that's a whole number, which makes sense because all the terms in the sequence are integers, so the sum should be an integer.So, part (1) is done, S_{21}=262.Now, part (2): Let c_n= (-1)^n *n / S_n. Determine the maximum term of the sequence {c_n}.So, c_n alternates in sign: for even n, it's positive; for odd n, it's negative.Since we're looking for the maximum term, and the negative terms can't be larger than the positive ones, we can focus on the even n terms.So, let's consider c_n for even n.Let me denote n=2k, where k is a positive integer.Then, c_{2k}= (-1)^{2k} *2k / S_{2k}= (1)*2k / S_{2k}=2k / S_{2k}.So, c_{2k}=2k / S_{2k}.Our goal is to find the maximum of c_{2k} over k ≥1.First, let's find an expression for S_{2k}.From the general formula:S_n= (1/2)n² + 2n + (7 +9(-1)^n)/4.For n=2k:S_{2k}= (1/2)(4k²) + 2*(2k) + (7 +9(-1)^{2k})/4.Simplify:(1/2)(4k²)=2k².2*(2k)=4k.(7 +9(1))/4=(16)/4=4.Therefore, S_{2k}=2k² +4k +4.So, S_{2k}=2k² +4k +4.Therefore, c_{2k}=2k / (2k² +4k +4)= (2k)/(2(k² +2k +2))=k/(k² +2k +2).So, c_{2k}=k/(k² +2k +2).We need to find the maximum of c_{2k}=k/(k² +2k +2) over k ≥1.To find the maximum, we can analyze the function f(k)=k/(k² +2k +2).Since k is a positive integer, we can treat f(k) as a function of a real variable and find its maximum, then check the integer values around that point.Compute the derivative of f(k):f(k)=k/(k² +2k +2).f’(k)= [ (1)(k² +2k +2) - k(2k +2) ] / (k² +2k +2)^2.Simplify numerator:(k² +2k +2) - (2k² +2k)= -k² +0k +2= -k² +2.Set derivative equal to zero: -k² +2=0 => k²=2 =>k=√2≈1.414.So, the maximum occurs at k=√2≈1.414.Since k must be an integer, we check k=1 and k=2.Compute f(1)=1/(1 +2 +2)=1/5=0.2.f(2)=2/(4 +4 +2)=2/10=0.2.f(3)=3/(9 +6 +2)=3/17≈0.176.f(4)=4/(16 +8 +2)=4/26≈0.153.So, the maximum occurs at k=1 and k=2, both giving c_{2k}=0.2=1/5.Therefore, the maximum term of {c_n} is 1/5, achieved at n=2 and n=4.Wait, let me confirm.c_2=2/S_2=2/10=1/5.c_4=4/S_4=4/20=1/5.c_6=6/S_6=6/34≈0.176.Yes, so c_2 and c_4 are both 1/5, and beyond that, c_n decreases.Therefore, the maximum term is 1/5.So, summarizing:(1) S_{21}=262.(2) The maximum term of {c_n} is 1/5, achieved at n=2 and n=4.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{262}(2) boxed{dfrac{1}{5}}"},{"question":"Farm tax is levied on the 40% of the cultivated land.

Then, \\"d gt 0\\" is ( )A: a sufficient but not necessary conditionB: a necessary but not sufficient conditionC: a necessary and sufficient conditionD: neither a sufficient nor necessary condition","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about arithmetic sequences and their sums. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about whether \\"d > 0\\" is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for something. But wait, the original problem isn't fully stated here. Hmm, looking back, it says, \\"Then, 'd > 0' is ( )\\". So, it must be referring to a condition related to the arithmetic sequence or its sum.Given that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference d, and S_n is the sum of the first n terms. So, the question is probably about whether d > 0 is a condition for S_n being increasing or something like that. Because in the previous context, that's a common question.Alright, so let's assume the question is: Is \\"d > 0\\" a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for the sequence {S_n} to be increasing? That makes sense because the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be increasing or decreasing depending on the common difference.First, let me recall that an arithmetic sequence has the form a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n-1)d]. Alternatively, it can also be written as S_n = n*a_1 + n(n-1)d/2.Now, if we want to determine whether {S_n} is increasing, we need to check if S_{n+1} > S_n for all n. Let's compute S_{n+1} - S_n:S_{n+1} = (n+1)/2 * [2a_1 + n*d]S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n-1)d]Subtracting these, we get:S_{n+1} - S_n = [(n+1)/2 * (2a_1 + n*d)] - [n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d)]Let me compute this step by step:First, expand both terms:= (n+1)/2 * 2a_1 + (n+1)/2 * n*d - n/2 * 2a_1 - n/2 * (n-1)dSimplify each term:= (n+1)a_1 + (n(n+1)d)/2 - n a_1 - (n(n-1)d)/2Now, combine like terms:= [ (n+1)a_1 - n a_1 ] + [ (n(n+1)d)/2 - (n(n-1)d)/2 ]Simplify each bracket:= a_1 + [ (n^2 + n - n^2 + n)d / 2 ]Wait, let me check that:In the second bracket, it's (n(n+1)d)/2 - (n(n-1)d)/2.So, n(n+1) = n^2 + n, and n(n-1) = n^2 - n.Subtracting these: (n^2 + n) - (n^2 - n) = 2n.So, the second bracket becomes (2n d)/2 = n d.Therefore, overall, S_{n+1} - S_n = a_1 + n d.So, for S_{n+1} > S_n, we need a_1 + n d > 0 for all n.Hmm, so the condition for the sum sequence {S_n} to be increasing is that a_1 + n d > 0 for all n.Now, let's analyze this condition.First, if d > 0, then as n increases, the term n d increases. So, if d > 0, then for sufficiently large n, a_1 + n d will definitely be positive, assuming a_1 is not too negative.But wait, the condition needs to hold for all n, including n=1, n=2, etc. So, for n=1: a_1 + d > 0For n=2: a_1 + 2d > 0And so on.So, if d > 0, then as n increases, the expression a_1 + n d increases. Therefore, the minimal value occurs at n=1: a_1 + d > 0.So, if d > 0 and a_1 + d > 0, then a_1 + n d > 0 for all n >=1.But if d = 0, then a_1 + n d = a_1 for all n. So, to have S_n increasing, we need a_1 > 0.If d < 0, then as n increases, a_1 + n d decreases. So, in this case, to have a_1 + n d > 0 for all n, we need that even as n approaches infinity, a_1 + n d doesn't become negative. But since d is negative, n d approaches negative infinity, so eventually a_1 + n d will become negative unless d >=0.Wait, that's a contradiction. If d < 0, then for large enough n, a_1 + n d will become negative, making S_{n+1} - S_n negative, which would mean S_n is decreasing for large n. Therefore, if d < 0, the sum sequence S_n cannot be increasing for all n.Therefore, for {S_n} to be increasing, we must have d >=0.But if d=0, then S_n = n a_1. So, for S_n to be increasing, we need a_1 >0.If d >0, then as I said earlier, we need a_1 + d >0.So, in summary:- If d >0 and a_1 + d >0, then S_n is increasing.- If d=0 and a_1 >0, then S_n is increasing.- If d <0, S_n cannot be increasing for all n.Therefore, the condition d >0 is not necessary because d can be zero as long as a_1 >0. So, d >0 is not necessary.Is d >0 sufficient? Well, if d >0, but a_1 + d <=0, then S_n is not increasing. For example, suppose a_1 = -10, d=1. Then a_1 + d = -9, which is negative, so S_{n+1} - S_n = a_1 + n d. For n=1, it's -9, which is negative, so S_2 < S_1. Therefore, d >0 alone is not sufficient.Therefore, d >0 is neither necessary nor sufficient on its own. It is part of a set of conditions.Wait, but in the options, it's about \\"d >0\\" as a condition. So, is it sufficient? No, because as I saw, if a_1 is too negative, even with d >0, S_n might not be increasing. Is it necessary? No, because d can be zero as long as a_1 >0.Therefore, \\"d >0\\" is neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for {S_n} to be increasing.Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought that if d >0 and a_1 + d >0, then S_n is increasing. So, d >0 is part of the sufficient condition, but on its own, it's not sufficient. And it's not necessary because d can be zero.Therefore, the answer should be D: neither a sufficient nor necessary condition.But let me double-check.Suppose d >0. Is it possible for S_n to not be increasing? Yes, if a_1 is too negative. So, d >0 is not sufficient.Is d >0 necessary? No, because d can be zero with a_1 >0, and S_n is still increasing.Therefore, d >0 is neither necessary nor sufficient.So, the answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=cosleft(frac{x}{2}+frac{pi}{5}right), then ()A: The graph of f(x) is symmetric about (-frac{2pi}{5},0)B: The graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x=frac{8pi}{5}C: f(x+frac{3pi}{5}) is an odd functionD: f(x) is an even function","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = cos(x/2 + π/5), and I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D are correct. Let me go through each option one by one.Starting with Option A: The graph of f(x) is symmetric about (-2π/5, 0). Hmm, symmetry about a point usually means that if you rotate the graph 180 degrees around that point, it looks the same. For a function to be symmetric about a point (a, b), it should satisfy the condition f(a + h) + f(a - h) = 2b for any h. In this case, the point is (-2π/5, 0), so b is 0. That means f(-2π/5 + h) + f(-2π/5 - h) should equal 0.Let me test this. Let's compute f(-2π/5 + h) and f(-2π/5 - h).First, f(-2π/5 + h) = cos[ ( (-2π/5 + h) ) / 2 + π/5 ] = cos[ (-π/5 + h/2) + π/5 ] = cos(h/2).Similarly, f(-2π/5 - h) = cos[ ( (-2π/5 - h) ) / 2 + π/5 ] = cos[ (-π/5 - h/2) + π/5 ] = cos(-h/2) = cos(h/2) because cosine is even.So f(-2π/5 + h) + f(-2π/5 - h) = cos(h/2) + cos(h/2) = 2cos(h/2). For this to be zero for all h, cos(h/2) must be zero for all h, which is not true. Therefore, the graph is not symmetric about (-2π/5, 0). So Option A is incorrect.Moving on to Option B: The graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x = 8π/5. Symmetry about a vertical line x = a means that f(a + h) = f(a - h) for any h. Let's check this.Compute f(8π/5 + h) and f(8π/5 - h).f(8π/5 + h) = cos[ (8π/5 + h)/2 + π/5 ] = cos[4π/5 + h/2 + π/5] = cos[5π/5 + h/2] = cos(π + h/2) = -cos(h/2).f(8π/5 - h) = cos[ (8π/5 - h)/2 + π/5 ] = cos[4π/5 - h/2 + π/5] = cos[5π/5 - h/2] = cos(π - h/2) = -cos(h/2).So f(8π/5 + h) = f(8π/5 - h) = -cos(h/2). Therefore, the function is symmetric about x = 8π/5. So Option B is correct.Option C: f(x + 3π/5) is an odd function. An odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). Let's define g(x) = f(x + 3π/5). Then g(-x) = f(-x + 3π/5).Let's compute g(x) and g(-x).g(x) = f(x + 3π/5) = cos[ (x + 3π/5)/2 + π/5 ] = cos(x/2 + 3π/10 + π/5) = cos(x/2 + 3π/10 + 2π/10) = cos(x/2 + 5π/10) = cos(x/2 + π/2).Similarly, g(-x) = f(-x + 3π/5) = cos[ (-x + 3π/5)/2 + π/5 ] = cos(-x/2 + 3π/10 + π/5) = cos(-x/2 + 3π/10 + 2π/10) = cos(-x/2 + 5π/10) = cos(-x/2 + π/2).Since cosine is even, cos(-x/2 + π/2) = cos(x/2 - π/2). Now, cos(x/2 - π/2) = sin(x/2) because cos(θ - π/2) = sinθ.On the other hand, g(x) = cos(x/2 + π/2) = -sin(x/2) because cos(θ + π/2) = -sinθ.Therefore, g(-x) = sin(x/2) and -g(x) = sin(x/2). So g(-x) = -g(x). Therefore, g(x) is an odd function. So Option C is correct.Finally, Option D: f(x) is an even function. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x). Let's check.f(-x) = cos(-x/2 + π/5) = cos(x/2 - π/5) because cosine is even.Compare this to f(x) = cos(x/2 + π/5). For f(-x) to equal f(x), we would need cos(x/2 - π/5) = cos(x/2 + π/5). However, cos(A) = cos(B) implies A = B + 2πn or A = -B + 2πn for some integer n. But x/2 - π/5 = x/2 + π/5 would imply -π/5 = π/5, which is false. Similarly, x/2 - π/5 = -x/2 - π/5 would imply x/2 = -x/2, which implies x = 0, but this must hold for all x. Therefore, f(-x) ≠ f(x), so f(x) is not even. Thus, Option D is incorrect.So, summarizing:A: IncorrectB: CorrectC: CorrectD: IncorrectTherefore, the correct options are B and C."},{"question":"If the operation a*b is defined as: a*b= begin{cases} a, & text{if } aleq b  b, & text{if } a>b end{cases}, such as 1*2=1, then the range of the function f(x)=2^x*2^{-x} is (　　)A: mathbb{R}B: (0,1]C: (0,+infty)D: [1,+infty)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a function defined using a special operation. Let me try to unpack it step by step.First, the operation is defined as ( a * b ) where:[a * b = begin{cases} a, & text{if } a leq b b, & text{if } a > b end{cases}]So, basically, this operation takes two numbers and returns the smaller one. For example, ( 1 * 2 = 1 ) because 1 is less than 2. Similarly, ( 3 * 2 = 2 ) because 2 is less than 3. Got it.Now, the function given is ( f(x) = 2^x * 2^{-x} ). Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what this function looks like and then determine its range.Let me write out the function using the definition of the operation:[f(x) = begin{cases} 2^x, & text{if } 2^x leq 2^{-x} 2^{-x}, & text{if } 2^x > 2^{-x} end{cases}]So, depending on whether ( 2^x ) is less than or equal to ( 2^{-x} ), or greater, the function takes the value of the smaller one.Let me analyze when ( 2^x leq 2^{-x} ). Taking logarithms might help, but since the base is the same, I can compare the exponents directly.So, ( 2^x leq 2^{-x} ) implies that ( x leq -x ), right? Because if ( a^b leq a^c ) and ( a > 1 ), then ( b leq c ). Since 2 is greater than 1, this holds.So, ( x leq -x ) simplifies to ( 2x leq 0 ), which means ( x leq 0 ).Similarly, when ( x > 0 ), ( 2^x > 2^{-x} ), so the function will take the value ( 2^{-x} ).Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) can be rewritten as:[f(x) = begin{cases} 2^x, & text{if } x leq 0 2^{-x}, & text{if } x > 0 end{cases}]Alright, so now I have a piecewise function. Let me analyze each piece separately.For ( x leq 0 ), ( f(x) = 2^x ). Since ( x ) is negative or zero, ( 2^x ) will be between 0 and 1. Specifically, as ( x ) approaches negative infinity, ( 2^x ) approaches 0, and at ( x = 0 ), ( 2^0 = 1 ).For ( x > 0 ), ( f(x) = 2^{-x} ). Here, ( x ) is positive, so ( -x ) is negative. Therefore, ( 2^{-x} ) is also between 0 and 1. As ( x ) increases, ( 2^{-x} ) approaches 0, and at ( x = 0 ), ( 2^{-0} = 1 ).Wait, so both pieces of the function are between 0 and 1. At ( x = 0 ), both expressions equal 1. So, the function is continuous at 0.Let me check the behavior:- As ( x ) approaches negative infinity, ( f(x) = 2^x ) approaches 0.- As ( x ) approaches positive infinity, ( f(x) = 2^{-x} ) approaches 0.- At ( x = 0 ), ( f(x) = 1 ).Also, for ( x leq 0 ), ( f(x) = 2^x ) is an increasing function because as ( x ) increases towards 0, ( 2^x ) increases from 0 to 1.For ( x > 0 ), ( f(x) = 2^{-x} ) is a decreasing function because as ( x ) increases, ( 2^{-x} ) decreases from 1 towards 0.So, putting it all together, the function ( f(x) ) starts at 0 when ( x ) is very negative, increases to 1 at ( x = 0 ), and then decreases back towards 0 as ( x ) becomes very positive.Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is 1, and the function approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0. So, the range of ( f(x) ) is all real numbers greater than 0 and up to and including 1.In interval notation, that's ( (0, 1] ).Looking back at the options:A: ( mathbb{R} ) – That's all real numbers, which isn't the case here because the function doesn't take values less than or equal to 0 or greater than 1.B: ( (0,1] ) – This matches what I found.C: ( (0,+infty) ) – This would include numbers greater than 1, which the function doesn't reach.D: ( [1,+infty) ) – This would include numbers starting from 1 upwards, which is not the case here since the function peaks at 1 and goes down.So, the correct answer should be B: ( (0,1] ).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Completely factor the following expression: [(8b^4 - 100b^3 + 14b^2) - (3b^4 - 10b^3 + 14b^2)]","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem to factor an expression. The expression is given as [(8b^4 - 100b^3 + 14b^2) - (3b^4 - 10b^3 + 14b^2)]. Hmm, factoring expressions can sometimes be tricky, but let's take it step by step.First, I remember that when you have an expression like this with a subtraction of two polynomials, I should probably start by distributing the negative sign to each term in the second polynomial. That way, I can combine like terms and simplify the expression before trying to factor it.So, let me write out the expression again, making sure to distribute the negative sign:[(8b^4 - 100b^3 + 14b^2) - (3b^4 - 10b^3 + 14b^2) = 8b^4 - 100b^3 + 14b^2 - 3b^4 + 10b^3 - 14b^2]Now, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. Let's group them together:- For the ( b^4 ) terms: ( 8b^4 ) and ( -3b^4 )- For the ( b^3 ) terms: ( -100b^3 ) and ( +10b^3 )- For the ( b^2 ) terms: ( 14b^2 ) and ( -14b^2 )Let me compute each of these:1. ( 8b^4 - 3b^4 = 5b^4 )2. ( -100b^3 + 10b^3 = -90b^3 )3. ( 14b^2 - 14b^2 = 0 )So, after combining like terms, the expression simplifies to:[5b^4 - 90b^3]Now, I need to factor this expression completely. Factoring usually starts by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. Let's look at the coefficients and the variables separately.First, the coefficients are 5 and 90. The GCF of 5 and 90 is 5 because 5 divides into 90 eighteen times without any remainder.Next, looking at the variables, we have ( b^4 ) and ( b^3 ). The GCF of ( b^4 ) and ( b^3 ) is ( b^3 ) because ( b^3 ) is the highest power of ( b ) that divides into both terms.So, the GCF of the entire expression is ( 5b^3 ). I'll factor this out from each term:[5b^4 - 90b^3 = 5b^3(b) - 5b^3(18)]Simplifying inside the parentheses:[= 5b^3(b - 18)]Now, I should check if this can be factored any further. The term inside the parentheses is ( b - 18 ), which is a binomial and doesn't factor any further since it's a linear term. The other factor is ( 5b^3 ), which is already factored completely.Therefore, the expression is fully factored as:[5b^3(b - 18)]I think that's it. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I distributed the negative sign correctly to each term in the second polynomial.2. I combined like terms accurately:   - ( 8b^4 - 3b^4 = 5b^4 )   - ( -100b^3 + 10b^3 = -90b^3 )   - ( 14b^2 - 14b^2 = 0 )3. I identified the GCF as ( 5b^3 ) and factored it out correctly.4. The remaining binomial ( b - 18 ) cannot be factored further.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations or reasoning. So, the completely factored form of the given expression is indeed ( 5b^3(b - 18) )."},{"question":"Given an equilateral triangle with side length ( a ), find the segment connecting a vertex of the triangle to a point that divides the opposite side in the ratio ( 2:1 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the length of a segment in an equilateral triangle. The triangle has side length ( a ), and I need to connect a vertex to a point on the opposite side that divides it in the ratio ( 2:1 ). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the equilateral triangle. All sides are equal, so each side is length ( a ). Let me label the triangle as ( ABC ), where ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are the vertices. Now, I need to find a point on one of the sides such that it divides the side into a ratio of ( 2:1 ). Let's say I choose side ( BC ) and the point is ( M ). So, ( BM:MC = 2:1 ).Since the entire side ( BC ) is length ( a ), I can find the lengths of ( BM ) and ( MC ). If the ratio is ( 2:1 ), then ( BM = frac{2}{3}a ) and ( MC = frac{1}{3}a ). That makes sense because ( frac{2}{3}a + frac{1}{3}a = a ), which is the total length of side ( BC ).Now, I need to find the length of the segment connecting vertex ( A ) to point ( M ). So, essentially, I need to find the length of ( AM ). Since ( ABC ) is an equilateral triangle, all angles are ( 60^circ ). That might be useful.I remember there's a formula called the Law of Cosines which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(C) ), where ( c ) is the side opposite angle ( C ). Maybe I can apply this here.In triangle ( ACM ), I know two sides: ( AC ) is length ( a ), and ( MC ) is ( frac{1}{3}a ). The angle between them, ( angle ACM ), is ( 60^circ ) because it's an equilateral triangle. So, I can use the Law of Cosines to find ( AM ).Let me write that out:[AM^2 = AC^2 + MC^2 - 2 cdot AC cdot MC cdot cos(60^circ)]Plugging in the known values:[AM^2 = a^2 + left(frac{1}{3}aright)^2 - 2 cdot a cdot frac{1}{3}a cdot cos(60^circ)]I know that ( cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} ), so substituting that in:[AM^2 = a^2 + frac{1}{9}a^2 - 2 cdot a cdot frac{1}{3}a cdot frac{1}{2}]Let me simplify each term step by step. First, ( a^2 ) is just ( a^2 ). Then, ( left(frac{1}{3}aright)^2 ) is ( frac{1}{9}a^2 ). Next, the last term: ( 2 cdot a cdot frac{1}{3}a cdot frac{1}{2} ). Let's compute that:The 2 and the ( frac{1}{2} ) cancel each other out, so we're left with ( a cdot frac{1}{3}a ), which is ( frac{1}{3}a^2 ).So now, putting it all together:[AM^2 = a^2 + frac{1}{9}a^2 - frac{1}{3}a^2]To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1, 9, and 3. The least common denominator is 9. So, converting each term:- ( a^2 = frac{9}{9}a^2 )- ( frac{1}{9}a^2 ) stays the same- ( frac{1}{3}a^2 = frac{3}{9}a^2 )So now, substituting back:[AM^2 = frac{9}{9}a^2 + frac{1}{9}a^2 - frac{3}{9}a^2]Combine the numerators:[AM^2 = frac{9 + 1 - 3}{9}a^2 = frac{7}{9}a^2]So, ( AM^2 = frac{7}{9}a^2 ). To find ( AM ), take the square root of both sides:[AM = sqrt{frac{7}{9}a^2} = frac{asqrt{7}}{3}]Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used the Law of Cosines correctly, substituted the values properly, and simplified the fractions correctly. It seems right. So, the length of segment ( AM ) is ( frac{asqrt{7}}{3} ).I think that's the answer. It makes sense because in an equilateral triangle, the medians, angle bisectors, and altitudes all coincide, but this is a different point since it's dividing the side in a ( 2:1 ) ratio instead of the usual ( 1:1 ) ratio for the centroid. So, the length should be different from the median, which in an equilateral triangle is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ). Since ( frac{sqrt{7}}{3} ) is approximately ( 0.88 ) and ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) is approximately ( 0.866 ), it seems reasonable that it's slightly longer.Yeah, I think I did this correctly. So, the length of the segment connecting vertex ( A ) to point ( M ) on side ( BC ) that divides it in the ratio ( 2:1 ) is ( frac{asqrt{7}}{3} ).**Final Answer**The length of the segment is boxed{dfrac{asqrt{7}}{3}}."},{"question":"Does there exist a natural number ( n ) such that[ n + S(n) = 125 ]where ( S(n) ) is the sum of the digits of ( n )?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Does there exist a natural number ( n ) such that ( n + S(n) = 125 ), where ( S(n) ) is the sum of the digits of ( n )? Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.First off, I need to understand what ( S(n) ) represents. It's the sum of the digits of ( n ). For example, if ( n = 123 ), then ( S(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ). So, the problem is asking if there's a number ( n ) where when you add ( n ) to the sum of its digits, you get 125.Alright, so I need to find ( n ) such that ( n + S(n) = 125 ). Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express ( n ) in terms of its digits and then set up an equation.Let's assume ( n ) is a three-digit number because 125 is a relatively large number, and if ( n ) were a two-digit number, the sum of its digits plus the number itself might not reach 125. So, let's say ( n = 100a + 10b + c ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are digits (i.e., ( 0 leq a, b, c leq 9 )).Then, ( S(n) = a + b + c ). So, substituting into the equation:( 100a + 10b + c + a + b + c = 125 )Simplify that:( 101a + 11b + 2c = 125 )Okay, so now I have this equation: ( 101a + 11b + 2c = 125 ). I need to find integers ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) between 0 and 9 that satisfy this equation.Let's think about the possible values for ( a ). Since ( 101a ) is a significant part of 125, ( a ) can't be too large. Let's try ( a = 1 ):( 101(1) + 11b + 2c = 125 )( 101 + 11b + 2c = 125 )Subtract 101 from both sides:( 11b + 2c = 24 )Now, I need to find ( b ) and ( c ) such that ( 11b + 2c = 24 ). Let's see:If ( b = 2 ):( 11(2) + 2c = 24 )( 22 + 2c = 24 )( 2c = 2 )( c = 1 )So, ( b = 2 ) and ( c = 1 ). That gives us ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = 1 ). Therefore, ( n = 100(1) + 10(2) + 1 = 121 ).Let me check if this works:( S(121) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 )( 121 + 4 = 125 )Yes, that works! So, ( n = 121 ) is a solution.Wait, but are there other possible values for ( a )? Let's check ( a = 2 ):( 101(2) + 11b + 2c = 125 )( 202 + 11b + 2c = 125 )Subtract 202:( 11b + 2c = -77 )That's not possible because ( b ) and ( c ) are non-negative digits. So, ( a = 2 ) is too big.What about ( a = 0 )? Then ( n ) would be a two-digit number:( 101(0) + 11b + 2c = 125 )( 11b + 2c = 125 )But ( 11b + 2c ) can't exceed ( 11(9) + 2(9) = 99 + 18 = 117 ), which is less than 125. So, ( a = 0 ) doesn't work.Therefore, the only possible value is ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = 1 ), giving ( n = 121 ).Just to be thorough, let's see if there are any other solutions with ( a = 1 ). We found ( b = 2 ), ( c = 1 ). Let's see if there are other ( b ) and ( c ) that satisfy ( 11b + 2c = 24 ).If ( b = 1 ):( 11(1) + 2c = 24 )( 11 + 2c = 24 )( 2c = 13 )( c = 6.5 )Not an integer, so invalid.If ( b = 3 ):( 11(3) + 2c = 24 )( 33 + 2c = 24 )( 2c = -9 )Negative, invalid.So, no other solutions for ( a = 1 ).Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 121 )."},{"question":"The function f(x) = sin x + x^3 + 1, if f(1) = a, then f(-1) =  （　　）A: -aB: 0C: a-2D: 2-a","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = sin x + x³ + 1, and I know that f(1) equals a. I need to find out what f(-1) is, and the options are given as A: -a, B: 0, C: a - 2, D: 2 - a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably compute f(1) and see what that gives me. So, f(1) is sin(1) + (1)³ + 1. Let me write that down:f(1) = sin(1) + 1 + 1 = sin(1) + 2.And they told me that f(1) equals a, so:a = sin(1) + 2.From this, I can solve for sin(1):sin(1) = a - 2.Okay, so now I know that sin(1) is equal to a - 2. That might be useful when I compute f(-1).Now, let's compute f(-1). The function is f(x) = sin x + x³ + 1, so plugging in -1:f(-1) = sin(-1) + (-1)³ + 1.Let me break that down. First, sin(-1). I remember that sine is an odd function, which means sin(-x) = -sin(x). So, sin(-1) is equal to -sin(1). That's helpful because I already have sin(1) expressed in terms of a.So, sin(-1) = -sin(1) = -(a - 2) = -a + 2.Next, let's compute (-1)³. That's just -1, since (-1) multiplied by itself three times is -1.So, putting it all together:f(-1) = sin(-1) + (-1)³ + 1 = (-a + 2) + (-1) + 1.Let me simplify that step by step. First, combine (-a + 2) and (-1):(-a + 2) + (-1) = -a + 2 - 1 = -a + 1.Then, add the last 1:(-a + 1) + 1 = -a + 2.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my steps.Starting again:f(-1) = sin(-1) + (-1)³ + 1.sin(-1) = -sin(1) = -(a - 2) = -a + 2.(-1)³ = -1.So, f(-1) = (-a + 2) + (-1) + 1.Combine the constants: 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.So, f(-1) = -a + 2.Wait, that seems different from my first calculation. Let me see:First, sin(-1) = -sin(1) = -(a - 2) = -a + 2.Then, (-1)³ = -1.So, f(-1) = (-a + 2) + (-1) + 1.Combine the constants: 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.So, f(-1) = -a + 2, which is the same as 2 - a.Ah, okay, so that's consistent. So, f(-1) is 2 - a.Looking back at the options, D is 2 - a, so that must be the correct answer.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. f(1) = sin(1) + 1 + 1 = sin(1) + 2 = a.2. Therefore, sin(1) = a - 2.3. f(-1) = sin(-1) + (-1)³ + 1 = -sin(1) - 1 + 1.4. Substitute sin(1) with (a - 2): - (a - 2) - 1 + 1 = -a + 2 - 1 + 1 = -a + 2 = 2 - a.Yep, that checks out. So, the answer is D: 2 - a."},{"question":"What should be the least number to be added to the 1202 to make it divisible by 4?","answer":"First, I need to determine the remainder when 1202 is divided by 4.
